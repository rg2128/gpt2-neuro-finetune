The International HapMap Project was de-signedtocreateapublic, genome-wide database of patterns of common human sequence variation to guide genetic studies of human health and disease, including genome-wide association (GWA) studies (1, 2) . Identifying genetic influences on complex diseases would be quite difficult if the risk-associated allelic variants at a particular disease-causing locus were very rare, so that for a disease to be common there would be many different causative alleles. The HapMap was instead designed to facilitate identification of commonly occurring disease-causing variants based upon the "common disease, common variant" hypothesis (3) . This hypothesis suggests that at least some of the genetic influences on many common diseases are attributable to a limited number of common allelic variants that are present in more than 5% of the population. GWA studies attempt to identify these common disease-causing variants by using highthroughput genotyping technologies to assay hundreds of thousands of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and relate them to clinical conditions and measurable traits. Because of the strong associations among SNPs in most chromosomal regions, only a few carefully chosen SNPs need to be typed in each region to predict the likely alleles at the rest of the SNPs in that region. Selecting the best tag SNPs requires precise mapping of the patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs, which differ somewhat across ancestral groups. The need for precise LD maps to facilitate genetic association studies was the stimulus for developing the human haplotype map (2, 4) . The International HapMap Project was a consortium of researchers in Canada, China, Japan, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States, organized to produce a human haplotype map by genotyping 270 samples from four populations with geographically diverse ancestry (1, 2) . These samples in-cluded 30 mother-father-adult child trios from the Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria; 30 trios from the CEPH (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain) collection of Utah residents of Northern and Western European ancestry; 45 unrelated Han Chinese individuals in Beijing, China; and 45 unrelated Japanese individuals in Tokyo, Japan. Approximately 1 million SNPs were genotyped and their LD patterns characterized in Phase I of the project. A description was published in 2005 (1) , but the data were available long before this and were central to several early genomic discoveries in complex diseases (5, 6) . The Phase II HapMap of more than 3 million SNPs was published in 2007 (7) . Subsequent research has shown that tag SNPs chosen using the HapMap are generally applicable across other populations, but there are some limitations, particularly for rarer SNPs and for populations with substantial proportions of recent African ancestry (8) . To allow better choice of tag SNPs and more detailed analyses for diverse populations, additional samples were collected from the same four initial HapMap populations and from seven additional populations: Luhya in Webuye, Kenya; Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya; Tuscans in Italy; Gujarati Indians in Houston, Texas; Chinese in metropolitan Denver, Colorado; persons of Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, California; and persons of African ancestry in the Southwestern United States (9) . These 1301 extended HapMap samples are now available from the Coriell Institute and have been genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0 platform and the Illumina 1 million SNP chip. Genome-wide sequencing of these samples to develop a comprehensive catalog of rarer variants will begin soon as part of the international 1000 Genomes Project (http://www.1000genomes.org). GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION TECHNOLOGIES, PRESENT AND FUTURE GWA studies have been defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as any studies of common genetic variation across the entire human genome designed to identify genetic associations with observable traits (10) . Implicit in this definition is that sufficient numbers of SNPs are typed to capture the vast majority of common variations (as noted above, these are alleles with a frequency of at least 5% in a population) throughout the entire genome. Such studies typically involve hundreds of thousands of SNPs and are not limited to known genes or regulatory regions. Instead, they assess genetic variation genome-wideinanalmost "agnostic" fashion, unconstrained by current imperfect understanding of genome structure and function (11) . Technologies for high-throughput assays of thousands, and then tens and hundreds of thousands, of SNPs developed in parallel with the progress of the HapMap, as it became clear that denser maps could effectively capture the majority of human genetic variation (12, 13) . These advances have made possible the dense genotyping needed to characterize the SNP variation within an individual, at a sufficiently low cost to allow the large sample sizes needed for comparisons of persons with and without disease. As genotyping platforms expand to include ever more tag SNPs, they capture increasingly larger proportions of the variation in any population, so that even samples of recent African ancestry, characterized by greater variation and shorter stretches of LD (14) , have most of the genome covered at high r 2 (7) . Current-generation high-throughput geno-typing platforms are extraordinarily efficient at genotyping SNPs but are less effective at geno-typing structural variants, such as insertions, deletions, inversions, and copy number variants (CNVs). These variants are common in the human genome, though not as common as SNPs (15) . The HapMap was not designed to capture these variants, although it can be used indirectly to do so, particularly for deletions that are in strong LD with SNPs (16) . CNVs, in which stretches of genomic sequence roughly 1 kb to 3 Mb in size are deleted or dupli-cated in varying numbers, have gained increasing attention because of their apparent ubiquity and potential dosage effect on gene expression (17) . A critical question related to methods for typing CNVs is whether they usually arise from a single originating event and then are propagated with diminishing degrees of LD on a single haplotype background, or instead are frequently regenerated on varying haplotype backgrounds (18) . The former situation would be conducive to tagging and indirect interrogation with HapMap-based genotyping platforms, while the latter would likely require direct interrogation or genomic sequencing for reliable association studies. Expansions and refinements of current genotyping platforms are increasingly focused on capturing CNVs adequately, and some success has already been achieved (19) . Array and sequencing methods are also being used to type structural variants, using the HapMap samples for development and cross-validation of the methods (20, 21) . The identification of rare, potentially causal variants that are poorly tagged by existing genotyping platforms will require sequencing DNA from large numbers of people for the genomic regions showing strong associations with complex traits (22) . The 1000 Genomes Project plans to produce modest sequence coverage (an average of four sequencing reads at any place in the genome) of ~1500 individuals that will extend the catalog of human genetic variation to variants present in 1%-5% of the population (10). It will thus limit the follow-up sequencing needed for investigating specific association findings to the search for very rare variants. Fine-mapping of candidate regions with common and rare SNPs optimally chosen, based on HapMap data, to maximize the regional genomic variation captured while minimizing costs, will refine association signals and narrow the list of possible functional variants. CURRENT MAJOR EFFORTS IN GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES The first association study generally considered to be truly genome-wide was published in March 2005 (23) , and by August 2008 > 170 such publications had identified > 150 genetic loci associated with > 60 complex diseases and traits (9, 24) . Although many such efforts have been and will continue to be undertaken individually, or as part of single large-scale studies such as the deCODE database (25) or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Framingham Study (26) , the value of collaborative efforts across studies and even across diseases is increasingly being recognized. A series of coordinated GWA publications in early 2007 in prostate cancer, breast cancer, and myocardial infarction demonstrated the value of assessing association reports in multiple studies simultaneously (9) . The joint publication of individual and combined associations with type 2 diabetes in three collaborating studies definitively showed the importance of combining individual-level genotype and phe-notype data in > 30,000 subjects to identify associations across several studies that no single study could reliably identify on its own (27) (28) (29) . This approach was subsequently expanded by the addition of seven more diabetes studies in the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium, with an effective sample size of > 50,000 (30) . Similarly large efforts focused on a single phenotype or closely related phenotypes in tens of thousands of subjects have yielded variants related to obesity (31) , lipids (32) , height (33) , and other traits. A more challenging and somewhat more controversial approach has been to combine individual-level data from cases with several related or even unrelated conditions and compare them to a common control group,in an effort to expand sample size and increase study power for each condition. The success of this method was demonstrated by the landmark Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study of 2000 cases of each of seven common diseases and 3000 shared controls (34) . This study provided many fundamental methodologic advances, including demonstration of the robustness of a single control group, the value of using cases of some diseases as controls for others, the greater power provided by increased sample size (numbers of subjects) rather than increased genomic coverage (numbers of SNPs), the critical need for manual review of automated genotyping calls, and the reliability of imputed genotypes for SNPs that were not actually typed by the genotyping platform. This approach of common controls and combined case groups used as controls was also employed by the WTCCC in its smaller study of 14,500 nonsynonymous SNPs in four autoimmune diseases, and in dense genome-wide genotyping of African cases of tuberculosis and malaria (35, 36) . The Wellcome Trust recently announced plans to conduct genome-wide genotyping in 120,000 additional people to identify variants related to 25 diseases and traits using the same approach (37) . Other collaborative studies of multiple diseases have focused less on combining genotypephenotype associations than on sharing methods for genotyping quality control, data analysis, imputation, and data distribution. Experience gained from early quality-control efforts in programs such as the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) of six complex diseases has been of great value in speeding the completion and analysis of geno-typing in later studies (19) . Several other collaborative programs are currently in the pipeline (Table 1 ). SUCCESSES IN IDENTIFYING VARIANTS RELATED TO COMPLEX DISEASES The first notable success of the GWA method came in March 2005, with the identification of a variant in the gene for complement factor H (CFH) associated with age-related macular degeneration (23) . Two additional GWA studies were published within that year, of Parkinson's disease and obesity (38, 39) , but efforts at replicating these findings have produced inconsistent results (40, 41) . In 2006, strong, robust associations with electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation (42) , neovascular macu-lar degeneration (43) , and inflammatory bowel disease (44) were identified and have since been the subjects of a substantial body of followup research to determine gene function and population impact. The pace of genomic discovery increased dramatically in 2007, following the increased availability of high-density genotyping platforms and experience in interpreting the results. Simultaneous publication of coordinated efforts in multiple diseases, and of the WTCCC study, have been described above. Rapid progress has continued into 2008 with identification of > 150 loci for > 60 common diseases and traits (Figure 1 ). Indeed, as Hunter & Kraft have noted, "There have been few, if any, similar bursts of discovery in the history of medical research" (45) . Unique aspects of the GWA method have made these discoveries possible. For example, GWA studies allow the investigator to narrow an association region to a 10-100 kilo-base length of DNA, in contrast to the 5-10 megabases usually detected in familial linkage studies. Because GWA regions typically contain only a few genes, rather than the dozens or hundreds implicated in linkage regions, potentially causative variants can be examined much more rapidly and in greater depth. As noted above, systematic interrogation of the entire genome frees the investigator from reliance on inaccurate prior hypotheses based on incomplete understanding of disease pathogen-esis and genome structure and function. The critical importance of this is illustrated by the fact that many of the associations identified to date, such as CFH in macular degeneration (23) and TCF7L2 in type 2 diabetes (6, 46) , have been surprising-the genes were not previously suspected of being related to the disease. Some, such as the strong associations of prostate cancer with SNPs in the 8q24 region (47) and Crohn's disease with the 5p13 region (34) , have been in genomic regions containing no known genes at all. And because current genotyping assays capture the vast majority of human variation genome-wide, rather than being focused on particular regions or pathways, once a GWA scan is completed it can be applied to any condition or trait measured in that same individual and consistent with his or her informed consent. Several of these discoveries have suggested etiologic pathways not previously implicated in these diseases, such as the autophagy pathway in inflammatory bowel disease (48) , the complement pathway in macular degeneration (23) , and the HLA-C locus in control of viral load in HIV infection (49) . Of considerable interest in determining pathophysiology have been variants or regions implicated in multiple diseases, such as the 8q24 region in prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers and the PTPN2 gene in type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease (9) . LIMITATIONS OF THE GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION METHOD Important limitations of GWA studies should also be kept in mind. One is their enormous potential for generating false-positive or spurious associations. Because they test hundreds of thousands of statistical hypotheses-one for each allele or genotype assessed-GWA studies have enormous potential for generating false-positive results due to chance alone. At the usual p < 0.05 level of significance, an association study of one million SNPs will show 50,000 SNPs to be "associated" with disease, almost all spuriously. One response to this problem is to reduce the false-positive rate by applying the Bonferroni correction, in which the conventional p-value is divided by the number of tests performed (45) . A one-million-SNP survey would thus use a threshold of p < 0.05/10 6 , or 5 × 10 -8 , to identify associations unlikely to have occurred by chance. This correction has been criticized as overly conservative, but it remains the most commonly used approach to date (50) . Another cause of the false-positive associations to which GWA studies are prone is population stratification. Allele frequencies vary between population subgroups, such as those defined by ethnicity or geographic origin, and these subgroups in turn differ in their risk for disease. GWA studies may then falsely identify the subgroup-associated genes as related to disease (50) . Genotyping error is another important cause of spurious associations that must be carefully sought and corrected. These problems have also plagued candidate-gene association studies, where systematic reviews showed that the vast majority of initial associations could not be replicated (51) . This experience has led to calls for all genetic association reports to include documented replication of findings as a prerequisite for publication. Consensus guidelines for replication in any GWA study, and, crucially, for complete description of the initial study so that replication is possible, have been developed (52) . Another limitation of GWA studies is their lack of power for identifying associations with rare sequence variants, since these are poorly represented on current genotyping platforms, as are structural variants. The often limited information available on environmental exposures and other nongenetic risk factors in GWA studies will make it difficult to identify geneenvironment interactions, or modification of gene-disease associations in the presence of environmental factors. Most variants identified to date are of relatively modest effect size, conferring less than a twofold increase in disease risk and necessitating large sample sizes to detect their effect (9, 34) . Although the importance of risk factors with small effect is debated, the potential for purifying selection to eliminate risk variants of large effect is unique to genetic studies and will tend to keep effect sizes small for common variants (53) . Modest associations can point the way to important therapeutic avenues, and, when considered in combination, may identify persons at substantially increased risk (28) . Such information can be particularly important, even in the absence of specific pharmaceutical agents targeted to such individuals, for more aggressive effortstoreduce known risk factors that are modifiable, such as obesity in prediabetes and smoking in age-related macu-lar degeneration (9) . DATA RELEASE AND PARTICIPANT PRIVACY GWA studies produce massive data sets, often representing substantial investments of public funds and providing unparalleled opportunities for research into complex diseases. Recognizing the research potential of these data sets, and following an extended period of public comment, NIH released its Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies, recommending widespread and responsible release of GWA data to the scientific community through the Database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (10, 54) . Study descriptions and protocols are available in the open-access portion of the db-GaP website; individual-level data are provided through a controlled-access process consistent with participants' informed consent. This commitment to rapid data release builds on the now wellestablished ethic in genomic community research projects of maximizing data access. Other GWA data access sites include the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) data portal (55) and the European Genotype Archive (EGA) (56) . Policies for data release have been developed collabora-tively among these projects and are quite similar. Published GWA studies and major findings are also catalogued by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) (24) , and GWA literature citations are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (57). The extensive genotype and phenotype information deposited in dbGaP raises important questions about possible risks to confidentiality of individual participants in broad data-sharing models. NIH policies were thus developed with deliberate attention to participant protections, both in the process of data submission from the original studies and in the processes of data access and use by outside investigators. A key aspect of the protections provided in dbGaP is removal of potentially identifying information prior to data submission, using criteria very similar to those described within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule (10) . Substantial participant protections are also applied at the dbGaP data-user level through a process managed by a Data Access Committee (DAC) composed of senior NIH staff. Investigators interested in obtaining controlled-access dbGaP data submit a Data Access Request, cosigned by their institution, constituting their agreement to abide by the principles and practices detailed in the NIH GWA study policy. These include keeping the data secure; using them only for the approved research purposes; acknowledging NIH policies on publications and intellectual property (IP); and submitting periodic reports on data use. Data users also agree not to distribute individual-level data in any form to any third parties (other than their own research staff who have agreed to the terms of access), nor to attempt to identify individual study participants. Recognizing the unprecedented pace of scientific progress in this field, NIH has designed its policies on data sharing in GWA studies to adapt to rapid technical advances. For example, data summaries and other group-level data such as allele frequencies and association statistics were initially provided in the open-access portion of dbGaP, in the belief that grouped data carried no threats to individual privacy. An innovative analysis for resolving the presence of an individual's DNA in a mix of DNA (as from a mass disaster) subsequently showed that an individual could be determined to have contributed to grouped allele frequency data with high reliability if one had data on that individual's genotypes at hundreds of thousands of SNPs (58) . NIH responded swiftly to remove these data sets from open access and place them behind the controlled-access process, and to notify other major data providers as well, who took similar actions (59) . Data access policies will continue to evolve with ongoing scientific advances in the field, to ensure that state-of-the-art data can be distributed and used in the most responsible and productive manner. Ensuring confidentiality and privacy is vital for databases containing individual-level genotype or phenotype information. Important concerns about the potential for persons carrying riskassociated variants (i.e., essentially everyone) becoming the object of discrimination by employers or insurers must be addressed. Application of GWA findings and other genomic research will be greatly facilitated by the formal legal protection against discrimination based on genetic information provided by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) that was signed into law in May 2008. When it goes into effect in 2009, GINA will protect against discrimination by health insurers and employers on the basis of genetic information. It is particularly important for GWA studies because of the breadth of information obtained in such studies; almost certainly every individual will carry at least one risk allele for at least one common disease. Protections under GINA will not only shield study subjects from the risk of genetic discrimination due to their participation in research, but more importantly will ensure that clinicians can order genetic tests identified from GWA studies to make more effective treatment decisions and can place this information in patients' records without risk to patients or their families. USE OF FINDINGS BY PHYSICIANS AND THE PUBLIC Although GWA discovery studies provide valuable clues to genomic function and pathophysiologic mechanisms, they are only a first step in identification of disease genes and are many steps removed from actual clinical application. Nonetheless, they tend to receive considerable media attention and have the potential for generating queries from patients about whether to get tested for the "new gene for Disease X" based on the latest report (50) . As noted above, many SNPs identified from such studies, as well as the genes or regions containing them, are currently of unknown function.Inad-dition, SNPs from GWA studies in complex diseases (unlike many Mendelian disorders) do not predict unequivocally who will develop disease and who will remain free of it. Instead, individuals carrying a particular risk genotype implicated in a GWA study have a greater risk (and sometimes only a modestly greater risk) of developing a complex disease than those who do not. The distinction between disease prediction and disease susceptibility is important because for many common variants, a substantial number of persons who do not carry the at-risk genotype may develop disease anyway owing to environmental or other factors. Indeed, for common diseases such as hypertension or diabetes, environmental or lifestyle factors may play such a strong role relative to genetics that many individuals with the at-risk genotype will develop disease for reasons that are probably unrelated to genotype, and others with the at-risk genotype may remain healthy in the absence of other important environmental exposures (60) . Identifying subgroups of individuals in whom SNP-outcome associations differ according to the presence or absence of other SNPs or environmental factors might eventually be of considerable clinical use, particularly for environmental factors that can be modified. The consensus at present is that GWA findings provide important clues to disease etiology and pathways to treatment, but current information is far too preliminary to recommend their use inprevention or treatment recommendations. Use of GWA findings in screening for disease risk, though beginning to be marketed commercially, is problematic. Although getting the latest "gene test" may be alluring, evidence is needed that such screening adds information to known risk factors (such as age, smoking, obesity, and family history), that effective interventions are available, that improved outcomes justify the associated costs, and that obtaining this information does not have serious adverse consequences for patients and their families. Given the availability of many genetic tests to anyone willing to pay for them, however, clinicians are soon likely to face anxious patients equipped with genotype information showing them to be at risk for multiple diseases. This may provide a "teachable" moment for encouraging patients to apply known preventive strategies against the conditions for which they are at increased risk. Such encounters also provide critical opportunities to discourage complacency in preventive strategies for which geno-typing information suggests a patient is not at increased risk. This is because so little is known about genetic influences on complex diseases and because variants identified to date typically explain so small a proportion of population risk. It may be useful to point out to patients considering purchasing these tests that obtaining a family history is often simpler and almost always cheaper. A positive family history typically confers a three-to fourfold increase in the risk of many diseases and is extremely useful in identifying persons to target for more intensive screening (61) . UTILITY OF FINDINGS FOR RESEARCH Perhaps the greatest initial utility of GWA findings is in the clues they provide for disease etiology, therapeutic targets, and gene function. As noted above, several of these discoveries have suggested etiologic pathways and therapeutic opportunities not previously implicated in the complex diseases with which they are associated, such as the autophagy pathway in inflammatory bowel disease, the complement pathway in macular degeneration, and the HLA-C locus in control of viral load in HIV infection (9) . Intriguing potential genetic connections between diseases previously believed to be unrelated-such as the finding that risks of type 2 diabetes, coronary disease, and familial melanoma are all associated with variants near CDKNA2A/B, or that risks of Crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes are related to variants near PTPN2-suggest new avenues of research in identifying other similarities in etiology, progression, or treatment of these conditions. The not infrequent occurrence of associations in "gene deserts" far from any known genes invites the question of whether studies of disease pathogenesis have been too focused on coding regions of the genome and have missed other important structural and functional clues to ge-nomic regulation. Research to pursue initial GWA discoveries will include replication studies in the same phenotypes and populations, to ensure the robustness of the findings, and in similar but not identical phenotypes and populations, to extend the findings and increase understanding of their mechanisms and importance (52) . Investigation of disease subtypes, such as estrogen receptor-positive versus -negative breast cancer, or young-onset or severely progressive forms of prostate cancer or diabetes, may be of great value in identifying which subgroups of alleles confer the highest risk and which subgroups of persons carry those alleles. Functional studies of highly replicated variants, in experimental models such as knockdown and overexpression studies (9) and in relationship to gene expression, as recently demonstrated for asthmaassociated variants in ORMDL3 (62) , will help to determine the mechanisms of gene function and how they are perturbed in disease, providing insights into possible preventive or therapeutic strategies. AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES OF INFORMATION The HapMap continues to evolve, with new SNPs being identified and LD patterns defined in both the original and newer HapMap populations. The primary portal to HapMap genotype data, as well as publications, tutorials, and other relevant resources, is the International HapMap Project website at http://www.hapmap.org. An up-to-date catalog of GWA studies is provided by the NHGRI's Office of Population Genomics at http://www.genome.gov/GWAstudies. This site lists all published studies attempting to assay 100,000 SNPs or more, noting the trait under investigation, the top new associations identified, their genomic region and nearby genes, pvalues, odds ratios, and links to the PubMed citations. Study descriptions, protocols, and associa-tion findings are available for many NIH-supported GWA studies in dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gap, and individual-level data may be requested for download through the controlled-access portion of that site. Those seeking additional information on specific genes related to complex diseases should consult Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=OMIM, the definitive catalog of human genes and genetic disorders. Findings from GWA studies are added to genes described in OMIM on a regular basis. More relevant to clinicians and patients may be the website and materials produced by the National Coalition for Health Professional Education in Genetics, a coalition of health professional organizations whose purpose is to promote health professional education and access to information about advances in human genetics, at http://www.nchpeg.org. SUMMARY The genome-wide database of human genetic variation produced by the International HapMap Project has provided a radically new approach for searching for genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The overwhelming success of these studies has led to surprising new insights into disease pathophysiol-ogy and therapeutic approaches, as well as new questions about genomic structure and function (and its interaction with genomic variation and environmental factors) in disease causation. GWA studies represent a powerful new tool for identifying genetic variants related to complex diseases, but they also have important limitations, including their potential for false-positive results and lack of sensitivity to detect rare variants. Their primary uses for the foreseeable future are likely to be in the investigation of biologic pathways of disease causation and normal health and development. Clinical application of these findings will require firm evidence that testing for them adds information to known risk factors, that effective interventions are available, that improved outcomes justify the associated costs, and that obtaining this information does not have serious adverse consequences for patients and their families. Although most GWA findings are clearly several steps removed from main-stream clinical use at present, functional investigation and experimental application of these findings are expected to produce new advances in the prevention and treatment of common diseases. FUTURE ISSUES 1. Defining the functional properties of genomic variants identified through GWA studies, including effects on gene expression, protein structure, and protein function. 2. Identifying copy number variants that may be contributing significantly to common disease risk but are scored inconsistently by current technologies. 3. Identifying rarer sequence variants that may be causative or additive in the disease associations identified in GWA studies. 4. Determining the population prevalence and risk associated with putative causal variants in unbiased and diverse population samples. 5. Estimating the increment in risk over established risk factors provided by GWAdefined variants. 6. Using information from GWA studies to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.

Introduction Appropriate behavioral responses to environmental stimuli require precise identification and timing of sensory signals. In the mammalian olfactory system, odor information is transduced into neural signals by olfactory receptors (ORs) expressed by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) (Jones and Reed, 1989) . Each OSN expresses only one type of ORs out of a repertoire of ϳ1100 OR genes. The axons of OSNs with the same OR converge on a pair of glomeruli in each olfactory bulb (OB) (Ressler et al., 1994; Vassar et al., 1994; Mombaerts et al., 1996; Belluscio et al., 2002) where they form synaptic connections with the second-order neurons, including local glomerular interneurons (Hayar et al., 2004a; De Saint Jan et al., 2009; Shao et al., 2009; Kiyokage et al., 2010; Gire et al., 2012) and apical dendrites of mitral and tufted cells (MTCs) (Najac et al., 2011) , the principal OB output neurons. One odorant typically differentially activates multiple types of ORs, OSNs, and their targeted glomeruli. Odor identity is encoded by specific combinations of activated glomeruli (Johnson et al., 1998; Mori et al., 1999; Johnson and Leon, 2007) . However, multiple lines of evidence support that activated glomeruli interact before the transfer of information to higher brain regions. In the Drosophila antennal lobe, activating a single glomerulus with one odor elicits activity of inhibitory local interneurons in all glomeruli (Hong and Wilson, 2015) . In the mouse olfactory bulb "short axon cells" (SACs) form the interglomerular circuit (IGC) that interlinks neighboring and distant glomeruli (Aungst et al., 2003; Kosaka and Kosaka, 2008; Kiyokage et al., 2010) . IGC acts on glomerular targets by corelease of the inhibitory transmitter, GABA, and the modulatory transmitter, dopamine (DA) (Borisovska et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013) . Previous in vivo studies reported that the IGC mediates GABA B receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of olfactory nerve (ON) terminals (McGann et al., 2005; Vucinic ´et al., 2006) . However, it remains unclear how the IGC acts on postsynaptic glomerular targets to shape their output to downstream networks. Selective activation of the IGC by optogenetic targeting of SACs triggers an inhibition-excitation sequence in external tufted cells (ETCs) (Liu et al., 2013) , a subpopulation of glomerular excitatory interneurons that receive direct OSN input (Hayar et al., 2004b; Liu and Shipley, 2008a) and monosynaptically excite MTCs (De Saint Jan et al., 2009; Gire et al., 2012) , vast majority of SACs and periglomerular cells (PGCs) (Hayar et al., 2004a; Shao et al., 2009; Kiyokage et al., 2010) . GABAergic PGCs provide strong feedforward inhibition of MTCs (Shao et al., 2012 (Shao et al., , 2013)) . These ETC-driven indirect pathways have been proposed to be the sole or predominant circuits underlying IGC action on MTCs (Whitesell et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015) . Here we combined in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology with optogenetics in transgenic mice to determine whether the IGC directly impacts MTCs. In contrast to previous studies (Whitesell et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015) , we find that the IGC directly and potently inhibits MTCs in parallel with the ETC-driven indirect pathways. We further demonstrate that this direct, monosynaptic connection is mediated by both GABAergic and electrical synapses. The IGC GABAergic inhibition is temporally amplified by MTC intrinsic properties and dominates over electrical synapse-mediated excitation to potently reduce MTC responses to sensory input for hundreds of milliseconds. Materials and Methods Animals. Wild-type male mice (C57BL/6J) and transgenic TH-Cre mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Th-cre)1Tmd/J, RRID: IMSR_JAX:008601) were obtained from Charles River and The Jackson Laboratory, respectively. A colony of transgenic animals was maintained by breeding heterozygous male TH-Cre mice with wild-type C57BL/6J female mice. Animals were maintained with a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and given food and water ad libitum. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Maryland Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) expression. ChR2 was expressed in SACs as described previously (Liu et al., 2013) . Briefly, the Cre-inducible adenoassociated virus serotype 9 (AAV2.9) carrying fusion genes for ChR2 and enhanced yellow (AAV2.9-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP) or mCherry fluorescent protein (AAV-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry) (Tsai et al., 2009) (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) were injected into the glomerular layer (GL) of the medial side of each OB between postnatal weeks 4 and 6. Under deep anesthesia, the skull was exposed and a small hole (ϳ0.5 mm diameter) drilled over each OB at coordinates at 3.95 mm from bregma and 0.2 mm from midline. AAV2.9 was injected into three points within the GL of the medial side of each bulb (depth 2.0 mm, 1.5 mm, and 1.0 mm) at a rate of 0.1 l/min for 5 min with a total volume of 0.5 l per bulb. After 2-3 weeks for ChR2-EYFP or -mCherry fluorescent protein expression, acute horizontal OB slices were prepared for experiments as described previously (Liu and Shipley, 2008b) . Slice preparation. Acute OB slices from 8-to 12-week-old male or female mice were prepared as previously described (Liu and Shipley, 2008b) . Briefly, horizontal slices (350 m) were cut with a VT1200 s vibratome in an ice-cold and oxygenated (95% O 2 -5% CO 2 ) sucrose-based ACSF containing the following: (in mM): 204.5 sucrose, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2.6 MgSO 4 , 0.5 CaCl 2 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 10 glucose. After 30 min incubation in normal ACSF at 30°C, slices were then transferred to ACSF at room temperature until they were used for experiments. Normal ACSF was continuously bubbled with 95% O 2 -5% CO 2 and had the following composition (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.3 MgSO 4 , 1.3 CaCl 2 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 10 glucose. During experiments, slices were perfused at 3 ml/min with ACSF equilibrated with 95% O 2 -5% CO 2 and warmed to 30°C. In vitro electrophysiology. Whole-cell patch-clamp or cell-attached recordings were made from MTCs or ETCs visualized using a BX50WI (Olympus) fixed-stage upright microscope equipped with near-infrared differential interference contrast optics. MTCs were identified by their location, cell size, and presence of lateral/primary dendrites. ETCs were identified as previously described (Liu, Aungst et al., 2012) . Briefly, they are identified for experiments based on the following three criteria: (1) spontaneous intrinsic burst firing that persists even when fast synaptic transmitter (AMPA, NMDA, and GABA A ) receptors are blocked; (2) "pear"-shaped cell body located in the deep half of the GL when viewed in infrared differential interference contrast optics; and (3) an apical dendrite with extensively ramified tuft confined to the glomerulus and absence of lateral dendrites in the external plexiform layer. Current or voltage signals were recorded with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and low-pass filtered at 4 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz with a DIGIDATA 1322A 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (Molecular Devices) using Clampex 9.2 (Molecular Devices). Patch recording electrodes were pulled from standard-wall glass capillary tubes without filament (Sutter Instruments). Patch pipettes (4 -7 M⍀) for whole-cell recording contained the following (in mM): 115 K-gluconate, 5.0 EGTA, 0.63 CaCl 2 , 5.5 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 3 Na 2 -ATP, 0.3 Na 3 -GTP, and 14 . The liquid junction potential (11-13 mV) was not corrected. Access resistance was typically Ͻ30 M⍀ and not compensated. Immunohistochemistry. OB slices (350 m thickness) were fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h after physiological recordings, then embedded in 10% gelatin in 1ϫ PBS and recut at 40 m using a vibratome (Leica). Immunohistochemistry was performed at room temperature on free-floating sections. Sections were incubated for 30 min in 2% BSA in TBST (0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, 0.9% saline, and 0.3% Triton X-100) and then incubated overnight with a mouse anti-TH antibody (1:20,000; Immunostar, RRID:AB_572268). Sections were rinsed in TBST (3 washes of 10 min duration) and incubated in anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Jackson Im-munoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. EYFP was detected by the intrinsic fluorescence of the molecule. Sections were rinsed in TBST (3 washes of 10 min duration), mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and coverslipped with a 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane-based anti-fade mounting media. Digital microscopy images were captured using a FluoView500 confocal microscope (Olympus) and assembled using CorelDraw X7 (Corel). Surgery and in vivo electrophysiology. Surgery was performed in adult (8 -12 weeks old) male (n ϭ 4) and female (n ϭ 4) TH-Cre mice with viral-ChR2 injection and expression as described above. Animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine mixture at an initial dose of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. The anesthesia level was judged by the dose at which the foot withdrawal reflex ceases and that the amplitude/rate of respiration measured by chest transducer was stable during the experiment (typically 1.5-3 Hz respiration). Supplemental doses of ketamine/xylazine mixture were used to maintain stable anesthesia throughout the surgery and recordings. The anesthetized animals were held in a stereotaxic device and body temperature maintained at 35°C-37°C with an insulated Peltier warming platform controlled and monitored by a thermoregulation device. After the skin was shaved and cut, a craniotomy opening (ϳ3 mm diameter) was made over the dorsal surface of the left OB using a dental drill and fine forceps. The dura was incised on the lateral side of the OB for recording electrode penetration. Extracellular single-unit recordings from MTCs on the medial sides of the left OB were performed with FHC tungsten microelectrodes with impedances ranging from 1 to 4 M⍀ as described previously (Zhan, Yin et al., 2013) . The electrode was positioned with a ϳ30°angle to the horizontal plane and inserted gradually from lateral dorsal surface to the mitral layer on medial side of the bulb to ensure that the medial GL with the apical dendrites of recorded mitral cell (MC) was unperturbed. The medial mitral layer was determined both by advancing the predicted distance from the lateral bulb surface and by assessment of characteristic field/unit activity of each layer traversed to the medial side (lateral GL, external plexiform layer, mitral cell layer, granule cell layer to medial mitral cell layer). Single units and local field potentials were recorded by a Plexon system. Signals from the recording microelectrode were amplified in series by an op-amp head-stage (Plexon, HST/8o50-G20-GR; 20ϫ amplification) and a differential preamplifier (Plexon, PBX2/16SP-R/ 16FP-G50; 50ϫ amplification). Single-unit signals were extracted by hardware high-pass filter (Ͼ150 Hz) and digitized at 20 kHz, whereas local field potentials were extracted by low pass filter (Ͻ150 Hz) and digitized at 4 kHz. Electrical and optical stimulation. Electrical stimulation was delivered by bipolar glass electrodes made from theta borosilicate tubes (Sutter Instruments). The isolated and constant current stimulation pulses (100 s) were triggered by a PG4000A digital stimulator (Cygnus Technology) or Master-8 stimulator (A.M.P.I.). Optical stimuli were delivered from a multimode optical fiber with opening diameter of 200 m in vivo (0.48 NA, ϳ15°beam divergence) or 25 m in vitro (0.1 NA, ϳ7°beam divergence). Optical stimulation was (ThorLabs) produced by a 100 mW, 473 nm, diode-pumped, solid-state laser MBL-III-473 (Optoengine) and gated with a laser shutter LST200 (NMLaser Products). Optical power delivered at the fiber tip was calibrated with a PM20A power meter (ThorLabs). For in vitro and in vivo recordings, onset and duration of optical stimulation were measured during every experiment by splitting 1% of the laser beam out to a high speed (30 ns rise-time) silicon photosensor (model 818-BB, Newport) and recorded by the same MultiClamp 700B amplifier (in vitro) as the patch electrode or recorded by the same Plexon system as the single-unit recordings (in vivo). Data analysis. In vitro data were first analyzed with Clampfit 9.2 (Molecular Devices). In vivo data were first sorted with the Offline Sorter (version 2.8.8, Plexon) before further analyses with NeuroExplorer (Nex Technologies). Numerical calculation and analysis were done with Microsoft Excel. Statistical analysis was performed with Origin, 2015 (Origin Lab) and NCSS 8 (NCSS). Statistical significance of population responses were calculated by using Student's t test or ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons. Graphs and plotting were created with NeuroExplorer, Origin 2015, and SigmaPlot 9.0 (Systat software). Sex differences between male/female animals in experiments were evaluated and none observed. Drugs and chemicals. APV (50 M), NBQX (disodium salt, 10 M), gabazine (GBZ; SR95531, 10 M), 8-bromo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5phenyl-1H-3-benzazepin-7-ol (SKF83566) hydrobromide (10 M), 8-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl]-1-phenyl-1,3,8-triazaspiro [4, 5] decan-4-one (spiperone) hydrochloride (10 M), and (3␤,20␤)-3-(3-carboxy-1-oxopropoxy)-11-oxoolean-12-en-29-oic acid (carbenoxolone [CBX]) disodium (300 M) were purchased from Tocris Cookson. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All drugs were bath applied by diluting in ACSF at the above-indicated doses unless otherwise stated. Results Direct and indirect IGC inhibition of MTCs The IGC is formed by SACs, which project to multiple glomeruli where they could make synaptic connections with the apical dendrites of MTCs as well as local glomerular neurons, including excitatory ETCs and inhibitory PGCs and SACs. In vitro and in vivo activation of IGC with electrical or optogenetic stimulation produces inhibition of MTCs (Aungst et al., 2003; Whitesell et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015) . However, the precise circuitry and synaptic actions of IGC are still unclear. MTCs receive direct synaptic input from ON terminals as well as local excitatory (ETCs) and inhibitory (PGCs and SACs) interneurons (Hayar et al., 2004; De Saint Jan et al., 2009; Shao et al., 2009; Gire et al., 2012) . The IGC monosynaptically targets ETCs and causes fast, GABA A receptor-mediated inhibition followed by slower, DA receptor-mediated, rebound excitation (Liu et al., 2013) . ETCs monosynaptically excite MTCs (De Saint Jan et al., 2009; Gire et al., 2012) and the majority of PGCs (Shao et al., 2009) . Thus, at least two indirect IGC pathways, SAC¡ETC¡MTC and SAC¡ETC¡PGC¡MTC, could mediate IGC's impact on MTCs, as suggested by previous studies (Whitesell et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015) . The SAC¡ETC¡MTC pathway would reduce excitation of MTCs and the SAC¡ETC¡PGC¡MTC pathway could produce a reduction followed by an enhancement of inhibition. However, another possibility is that GABAergic SACs directly, monosynaptically inhibit MTCs. To investigate these possibilities, MTCs were voltage-clamped at Ϫ60 mV, and their responses to optical activation of ChR2 expressing SACs were recorded in OB slices of TH-Cre mice. Consistent with the previous studies (Liu et al., 2013) , ChR2expressing neurons are restricted in the OB GL (Fig. 1A ). Immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 1B-D ) showed that 90.8 Ϯ 0.6% of ChR2-expressing neurons are TH protein-positive (n ϭ 108 cells from 3 mice, data previously reported) (Liu et al., 2013) . The remaining ϳ10% may represent immature SACs that express the TH gene and drive ChR2 but do not yet express detectable levels of TH protein (Baker et al., 2001; Saino-Saito et al., 2004) . Previous studies show that Ͻ10% of TH ϩ glomerular neurons coexpress GAD65 (Kosaka and Kosaka, 2008; Kiyokage et al., 2010) , a molecular marker of PGCs that have single dendrites restricting to individual glomeruli. Thus, to avoid possible PGC actions, optically stimulated glomeruli were separated from the glomeruli containing the apical dendrites of the recorded MTCs by 3-4 glomeruli (Fig. 1E , inset) (Liu et al., 2013) unless otherwise indicated. Brief (2 ms) optical activation of SACs evoked long-lasting outward currents in MTCs (Fig. 1E ). These currents had an initial peak with a rise-to-peak time of 31.5 Ϯ 2.3 ms (n ϭ 8), followed by a sustained plateau. The half-peak width of these outward currents ranged from 367 to 723 ms (412.8 Ϯ 25.1 ms, n ϭ 8). When the IGC indirect pathways via ETC¡MTC and ETC¡PGC synapses were blocked with fast glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX and APV, the duration of these outward current was shortened to a half-peak width of 57.2 Ϯ 8.6 ms (n ϭ 8, p Ͻ 0.001; Fig. 1F ) and total charge reduced from 40.6 Ϯ 6.7 nA ϫ ms to 4.8 Ϯ 1.4 nA ϫ ms (n ϭ 8, p Ͻ 0.001; Fig. 1G ). However, the initial time-to-peak latency was unaltered (32.4 Ϯ 1.3 ms, n ϭ 8, compared with before NBQX and APV) and peak amplitude reduced by only 12.7 Ϯ 3.4% ( p Ͻ 0.05, n ϭ 8). Moreover, with the IGC indirect pathways blocked, the onset latency of the outward current ranged from 2.1 to 2.8 ms (2.40 Ϯ 0.04 ms, n ϭ 8) with synaptic jitter (SD of latency) of 174 Ϯ 11 s (n ϭ 8; Fig. 1H ). The short, consistent latencies of the NBQX/ APV-resistant, SAC-evoked outward currents conform to a direct, monosynaptic, inhibitory connection from SACs to MTCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that IGC inhibits MTCs by parallel circuits: direct, monosynaptic SAC¡MTC inhibition that is prolonged by the indirect polysynaptic circuit involving SAC¡ETC synapses (Liu et al., 2013) . Direct IGC input produces long-lasting inhibition of MTCs The finding that both direct and indirect pathways mediate IGC inhibition of MTCs sharply contrasts with previous studies reporting that indirect pathways are the sole or major mediators of IGC inhibition of MTCs (Whitesell et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015) . One explanation for this discrepancy is that impact of the direct SAC-MC connection on postsynaptic neuron firing is too subtle to be detected, especially by measuring intracellular Ca 2ϩ signal changes (Banerjee et al., 2015) . To test this idea, we examined MTC responses to brief (2 ms) optical activation of the IGC with cell-attached recordings. Cell-attached recording provides high-fidelity spike data without altering intracellular chloride, which could impact the magnitude or even the polarity of GABA A receptor-mediated responses. Consistent with our whole-cell voltage-clamp results above, brief optical stimulation elicited a long-lasting inhibition of MTC firing (Fig. 2A ). Next, we eliminated the contribution of the IGC indirect pathways by blocking the glutamatergic ETC¡MTC and ETC¡PGC circuits with NBQX and APV. IGC inhibition duration was 671 Ϯ 81 ms (n ϭ 5) in ACSF and 445 Ϯ 51 ms (n ϭ 5, p Ͻ 0.05) in NBQX and APV (Fig. 2 B, C ). This shortened the duration of inhibition but not to the extent predicted from the inhibition duration change with NBQX/APV in our voltage-clamp findings (Fig. 1 E, F ). There are two possible explanations for this finding: (1) the typical internal solution used in voltage-clamp experiments alters the intracellular chloride concentration of MTCs such that the  contribution of the direct IGC pathway is underestimated; and/or (2) MTC intrinsic membrane properties amplify/prolong the effect of brief direct IGC-mediated outward current to cause long-lasting inhibition of spiking. To test the first possibility, we recorded MTCs in current clamp using the same internal solution as in the voltage-clamp experiments. The duration IGC-evoked inhibition of MTC firing was 656 Ϯ 53 ms (n ϭ 11) in ACSF and 429 Ϯ 32 ms (n ϭ 11) in NBQX and APV (Fig. 2C ), neither of which is statistically different from durations recorded in cell-attached mode (671 Ϯ 81 ms in ACSF and 445 Ϯ 51 ms in NBQX and APV, n ϭ 5). Thus, the prolonged duration of IGC¡MTC inhibition is not due to altered intracellular chloride concentration by the internal solution in patch-clamp electrodes. Intrinsic properties of postsynaptic neurons that amplify the actions of synaptic input have been reported in multiple classes of neurons. For example, persistent inward currents and T-type calcium currents prolong or enhance excitatory synaptic inputevoked membrane depolarization or firing in neocortical pyramidal neurons (Stuart and Sakmann, 1995) , spinal motoneurons (Hultborn et al., 2004; Heckman et al., 2008) , thalamic reticular neurons (Crandall et al., 2010) , olfactory bulb ETCs (Liu and Shipley, 2008a) , and MCs (Johnston and Delaney, 2010) . Amplification of inhibitory synaptic inputs by postsynaptic voltagedependent conductances has been reported in cortical pyramidal neurons (Williams and Stuart, 2003) and cerebellar Purkinje neurons (Solinas et al., 2006) . Thus, the interplay between synaptic inputs and the intrinsic properties of the postsynaptic neuron are critical determinants in many neural circuits. If the long-lasting IGC inhibition of MTCs is due to intrinsic properties of MTCs, rather than a circuit effect, then injecting brief hyperpolarizing currents into MTCs should elicit similar long-lasting inhibition. To investigate this, we first averaged IGC-evoked IPSCs in 8 MTCs measured with the indirect IGC pathway blocked by NBQX and APV, yielding average peak amplitude 75.6 pA, decay time constant (tau) 41.5 ms (ϳ100 ms total duration), and the total charge 5.8 nA/ms. Injection of this "simulated," direct IGC IPSC produced robust inhibition in 8 of 8 MTCs recorded in ACSF (Fig. 3A , left traces and PSTH graph). The duration of inhibition ranged from 350 to 770 ms (mean 545.2 Ϯ 45.2 ms, n ϭ 8; Fig. 3C ), which was 354% longer than the duration of the simulated IPSC (p Ͻ 0.001; n ϭ 8; Fig. 3A ). This long-lasting inhibition was unchanged after blocking circuit influences with NBQX, APV, and GBZ (average duration 513.9 Ϯ 41.8 ms; n ϭ 8, p Ͼ 0.05 compared with 545.2 Ϯ 45.2 ms in ACSF; Fig. 3A, C ). Together, these findings suggest that MTC intrinsic properties prolong the impact of brief inhibitory inputs. How might this work? In healthy MTCs, the membrane potential alternates between an upstate and downstate (Heyward et al., 2001) . The upstate results from a balance between the inward persistent sodium current (I NaP ) (Heyward et al., 2001; Hage and Salkoff, 2012) and outward current(s). The simulated IGC IPSC may hyperpolarize the MTC membrane potential below the activation threshold for I NaP and thus terminate MTC spontaneous/evoked spiking by pushing cells into the downstate. Because MTCs have relatively weak hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I h ) (Angelo and Margrie, 2011; Angelo et al., 2012) , strong and/or synchronous inhibitory synaptic input will generate prolonged inhibition of MTCs until the membrane slowly ramps back to the activation threshold of I NaP that brings membrane potential to the upstate. If this is true, then one predication is that long-lasting inhibition of MTCs can be triggered by even very brief membrane hyperpolarization. To test this prediction, we recorded MTC responses to hyperpolarizing current pulses of varying amplitude and duration (Fig. 3B, C pA/100 ms and 100 pA/50 ms have the same charge (5.0 nA/ms) but result in different MTC inhibition duration (341.3 Ϯ 35.7 ms vs 445.0 Ϯ 50.5 ms, n ϭ 8, p Ͻ 0.01), we conclude that charge is not the primary driver of MTC inhibition response to the IGC. Rather, input current amplitude is more important than duration for intrinsic amplification of inhibition in MTCs. With larger amplitude pulses, the inhibition duration is ϳ8.9 and 4.8 times the 50 and 100 ms pulses, respectively. Together, these data show that MTC intrinsic properties preferentially prolong strong inhibition (Ͼ50 pA), such as that evoked by IGC activation. Therefore, circuit-level inhibition is not only a function of presynaptic activity but can also be strongly shaped by the intrinsic properties of the postsynaptic neuron. Is direct SAC¡MTC transmission mediated by coreleased GABA and DA? GABA and DA corelease by SACs produces an inhibitory-excitatory sequence in postsynaptic ETCs (Liu et al., 2013) . Moreover, the SAC¡ETC synapse is reported to support electrical coupling (Banerjee et al., 2015) . Is the direct SAC¡MTCs synapse also mediated by coreleased GABA and DA and does it support electrical coupling? To investigate this, we again isolated the IGC¡MTC direct circuit with NBQX and APV to eliminate indirect pathways via ETCs and examined MTC responses to optical stimulation of SACs with and without GABA A and DA receptor antagonists. Activation of SACs evoked direct, short-onset latency inhibition of MTC firing in all tested cells with either current-clamp recording (n ϭ 5; Fig. 4A 1 -B 2 ) or cell-attached (n ϭ 4, data not shown). As results from cell-attached and current-clamp recordings were identical, spike data from these cells were pooled for analysis. Addition of the GABA A receptor blocker, GBZ, transformed the MTC responses from long-lasting inhibition (497.3 Ϯ 15.9 ms, n ϭ 9) to brief highfrequency spiking (frequency 71.2 Ϯ 5.9 Hz, duration 143.6 Ϯ 13.3 ms) followed by inhibition of spiking (568.2 Ϯ 14.1 ms) in 9 of 9 MTCs recorded in either cell-attached or current-clamp conditions (Fig. 4C 1 ,C 2 ). Conversion of the initial portion of IGCevoked inhibition into excitation by the GABA A receptor blocker GBZ indicates that the direct, monosynaptic inhibition of MTCs is mediated by GABA released from SACs and dominates over an excitatory component of synaptic action. What accounts for this IGC-evoked fast glutamate/GABA receptor-independent excitation-inhibition response? It could be the result of a pronounced spikeinduced after-hyperpolarization (AHP) that would be present only when spikes are elicited in MTCs (Dumenieu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015) . If this were the case, eliminating the IGC-evoked MTC spiking should abolish the following inhibition, as there would be no spike-evoked AHP. To test this, we repeated the above currentclamp experiments with injected current to hyperpolarize MTCs below spiking threshold. In this condition, brief activation of SACs still evoked a depolarization followed by hyperpolarization, although no spiking was elicited (Fig. 4E 1 ,E 2 ). The depolarization lasted for 561.9 Ϯ 11.5 ms with a peak amplitude of 3.4 Ϯ 1.1 mV (n ϭ 5), and the subsequent hyperpolarization had a duration of 602.4 Ϯ 21.3 ms (n ϭ 5) with a peak amplitude of 2.1 Ϯ 0.7 mV (n ϭ 5). These results argue that a spike-dependent AHP is not the major contributor to the inhibitory component of the IGC-evoked, fast glutamate/GABA receptor-independent response in MTCs. Could DA play a role in this complex response? GABA and DA are coreleased at SAC¡ETC synapses (Borisovska et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013) . DA acts on D1-or D2-like receptors to produce excitatory or inhibitory actions in many other neurons (Beckstead et al., 2004; Govindaiah and Cox, 2005; Liu et al., 2013) . However, IGC-evoked MTC responses were unaltered by DA antagonists. First, the IGC-evoked excitation-inhibition of firing responses identically exhibited in both cell-attached and current-clamp recordings in the presence of fast glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic blockers showed no further change following addition of DA D1-and D2-like receptor antagonists, (2) addition of GBZ revealed a brief excitation immediately following optical stimulation in forms of firing (C2) or subthreshold depolarization (E2, red trace) followed by firing inhibition or hyperpolarization; and (3) further addition of DA receptor antagonists showed no effect on the excitation-inhibition responses (D2 compared with C2 and dark blue trace compared with red trace in E2). SKF83566 and spiperone (Fig. 4C 1 ,C 2 compared with Fig. 4D 1 ,D 2 ). The IGCevoked brief spiking in MTCs in the presence of DR antagonists had a frequency of 69.1 Ϯ 5.8 Hz (n ϭ 9, not significant compared with pre-DA antagonists) and duration of 137.9 Ϯ 14.5 ms (n ϭ 9, not significant compared with pre-DA antagonists), whereas the following inhibition of spiking lasted for 573.6 Ϯ 16.8 ms (n ϭ 9, not significant compared with pre-DA antagonists). Second, the depolarization-hyperpolarization response sequence in current clamp with hyperpolarizing current injection (Fig. 4E 1 ,E 2 ) was also unaltered by the further addition of the DA D1-and D2like receptor antagonists, SKF83566 and spiperone (Fig. 4E 1 ,E 2 , dark blue trace compared with red trace).The subthreshold response in current clamp in the presence of DA antagonists showed a depolarization duration of 557.8 Ϯ 9.8 ms and peak amplitude of 3.3 Ϯ 1.2 mV followed by hyperpolarization with duration of 601 Ϯ 10.5 ms and peak amplitude of 2.0 Ϯ 0.9 mV. None of these parameters differed from those measured in pre-DA antagonist conditions (n ϭ 5, not significant). These results indicate that the direct IGC¡MTC synapse can generate an excitatory-inhibitory response sequence that is independent of glutamate, GABA, and DA. What could mediate this response? IGC-MTC synapses support strong electrical coupling; IGC-ETC synapses do not Gap junction-mediated electrical coupling has been reported between ETCs and MTCs affiliated with same glomerulus (De Saint Jan et al., 2009) , and a recent study reported electrical synapses between SACs and ETCs (Banerjee et al., 2015) . However, it is also possible that SACs directly couple with MTCs via gap junction. In this scenario, optical stimulation evokes spiking followed by AHP in SACs and that these excitation-inhibition currents are transferred to MTCs via gap junctions. If this were true, response duration in MTCs should vary with duration of SAC activation. The second prediction is that blocking electrical coupling should eliminate both the excitatory and inhibitory components of the IGC-evoked, glutamate/GABA receptor-independent excitation-inhibition response in MTCs. To test these predictions, we clamped MTCs at Ϫ60 mV and recorded their response to optical activation of IGC in the presence of the fast synaptic blockers NBQX, APV, and GBZ, as before. Consistent with our current-clamp findings (Fig. 4C 1 -D 2 ), MTCs responded to brief or long (1 s) IGC stimulation with brief or long inward currents, respectively (Fig. 5 A, C ), followed by a small outward current. These currents were not altered by DA D1-and D2-like receptor antagonists (Fig. 5 A, C, E, G ), confirming that they are not mediated by DA. However, addition of the gap junction blocker CBX entirely abolished both responses (Fig. 5 A, C, E, G ). This shows that there is strong gap junction-mediated electrical coupling between SACs and MTCs.

When ETCs are held at Ϫ90 mV, this stimulation evokes larger inward currents (H, black symbols). Responses of ETCs, but not MTCs, are sensitive to DA receptor antagonists (green symbols). Addition of CBX abolishes residual currents in both MTCs (G, red symbols) and ETCs (H, red symbols). Could this electrical coupling be mediated by serial electrical synapses in a SAC¡ETC¡MTC circuit, as suggested by a recent study (Banerjee et al., 2015) ? Electrical synapses (unlike chemical synapses) lack gain as they allow passive current flow. However, due to cabling and capacitance properties of sequential cells, the response in the postsynaptic neuron is in general smaller in amplitude than the presynaptic neurons. Thus, if current flows via serial gap junctions from SAC¡ETC¡MTC, then the SAC-ETC coupling should be at least equal to or slightly stronger than the IGC¡MTC coupling. To test this, we voltage-clamped ETCs at Ϫ60 mV, their average resting membrane potential (Liu and Shipley, 2008b) , and recorded responses to optical activation of the IGC. Consistent with our previous study (Liu et al., 2013) , brief activation of SACs evoked a small inward current in the presence of fast glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor blockers (Fig. 5B , top). This current had an average total charge of 0.52 Ϯ 0.12 nA ϫ ms (n ϭ 5; Fig. 5F ). However, 94.7 Ϯ 3.5% (n ϭ 5) of this current was blocked by SKF83566 and spiperone (0.021 Ϯ 0.007 nA ϫ ms, n ϭ 5, p Ͻ 0.001) (Fig. 5 B, F ), indicating that it is mediated almost entirely by DA receptors. Addition of the gap junction blocker, CBX, abolished the residual current (5.3 Ϯ 0.8%), indicating negligibly weak electrical coupling between SACs and ETCs at physiological membrane potentials (Ϫ60 mV). Long (1 s) optical stimulation of the IGC evoked only a small, brief inward current in 4 of 5 ETCs (half peak width 17.2 Ϯ 4.1 ms: peak amplitude 3.4 Ϯ 1.1 pA, charge 0.34 Ϯ 0.11 nA ϫ ms, n ϭ 4) followed by a larger, longer duration outward current (maximal amplitude 9.5 Ϯ 2.8 pA; half-width 237.3 Ϯ 15.4 ms, charge 1.41 Ϯ 1.15 nA ϫ ms; Fig. 5 D, H ). DA antagonists blocked 92.1 Ϯ 5.9% of this response (Fig. 5H ) leaving only a small, long-lasting inward residual current (1.75 Ϯ 1.07 nA ϫ ms; Fig. 5 D, H ) that was abolished by CBX (0.02 Ϯ 0.01 nA ϫ ms, n ϭ 5) (Fig. 5 D, H ). Thus, our findings indicate that Ͼ90% of the IGCevoked inward current in ETCs is due to activation of DA receptors and that electrical coupling is negligible. These findings contrast starkly with the Banerjee et al. (2015) conclusion of IGC-ETC electrical synapses based on experiments testing neither DA receptor antagonists nor gap junction blockers. We hypothesize that the IGC¡ETC inward current, attributed to gap junctions by Banerjee et al. (2015) is actually due to DA enhancement of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current I h (Liu et al., 2013) . If correct, then activation of the IGC should evoke even larger inward currents in ETCs held at the hyperpolarized voltages used by Banerjee et al. (2015) , and these larger currents should also be blocked by DA receptor antagonists. To test this, we repeated these experiments in the same ETCs voltage-clamped at Ϫ90 mV. Because I h current varies with both the amplitude and duration of hyperpolarization, we tested brief (2 ms) and long (1 s) optical stimulation pulses. As predicted, both brief and long optical stimuli elicited larger inward currents at Ϫ90 mV (Fig. 5 B, D ) than at Ϫ60 mV (Fig. 5 F, H ). For brief IGC activation, ETCs responded with inward currents with an average total charge of 0.83 Ϯ 0.09 nA ϫ ms (n ϭ 5; Fig. 5F ; p Ͻ 0.05 compared with 0.52 Ϯ 0.12 nA ϫ ms at Ϫ60 mV with 2 ms stimulation) and for long pulses large inward current of 23.1 Ϯ 4.4 nA ϫ ms was elicited (n ϭ 5; Fig. 5H ; p Ͻ 0.001 compared with 0.34 Ϯ 0.11 nA ϫ ms inward charge at Ϫ60 mV with long stimulation). Moreover, as expected from our previous finding of DA enhancement of I h current in ETCs (Liu et al., 2013) , DA receptor antagonists nearly completely abolished these IGC-evoked inward currents in ETCs held at Ϫ90 mV. The current evoked by brief SAC activation was reduced by 96.4% to 0.03 Ϯ 0.01 nA ϫ ms; n ϭ 5, p Ͻ 0.05; Figure 5F ), whereas the current evoked by long SAC activation was reduced by 77.1% to 5.28 Ϯ 0.90 nA ϫ ms; n ϭ 5, p Ͻ 0.001; Figure 5H ). Addition of the gap junction blocker CBX abolished these residual currents for both brief and long IGC activations (Fig. 5 F, H ). Therefore, even at extremely hyperpolarized levels, most of the SAC¡ETC inward current is due to DA augmentation of I h and not electrical coupling. Together, these findings demonstrate that gap junction coupling is strong between SACs and MTCs but negligible between SACs and ETCs at resting membrane potentials. IGC regulates MTC responses to ON input MTCs are the principal OB output neurons; they receive sensory input and transfer signals directly to the olfactory cortex and other downstream networks. Thus, modulation of MTC excitability impacts the OB input-output transformation function. We previously showed that electrical activation of neighboring glomeruli inhibited ON-evoked response in MTCs (Aungst et al., 2003) , but this effect is most effective when delivered ϳ100 ms subsequent to ON-evoked MTC responses (Shirley, Coddington et al., 2010) . Electrical stimulation nonselectively activates all distant glomerular circuits: does selective SACs activation have the same temporal dynamic? To investigate this, we combined current-clamp recordings of MTCs with electrical stimulation of the ON and optogenetic activation of SACs at different time intervals in OB slices. MTCs responded to ON electrical stimulation (E-stim) alone with long-duration (ϳ600 ms) spike firing (Fig. 6A ), consistent with previous studies showing ON-evoked long-lasting depolarization and spiking in MTCs (Carlson et al., 2000; De Saint Jan et al., 2009; Shao et al., 2012) . We expressed ON-evoked spiking within a 300 ms time window following E stimulation as a percentage of its baseline spontaneous firing averaged Ͼ700 ms immediately before ON stimulation (Fig. 6G ). MTC spiking evoked by ON stimulation alone was 762.7 Ϯ 154.1% (n ϭ 12) of baseline level (E-stim only in Fig. 6 A, G ). We then examined MTC responses to brief optical stimulation (O-stim, 2 ms) of the IGC alone. As with the preceding findings (Figs. 1; 2; 4), activation of the IGC consistently produced a long-lasting inhibition in 12 of 12 MTCs (Fig. 6B ). MTC spiking within a 300 ms time window following O-stim was 5.9 Ϯ 1.1% of the spontaneous baseline level (n ϭ 12). To assess the impact of SAC activation on ONevoked MTC spiking, ON stimulation was followed by optical stimulation of the IGC at time intervals ranging from 0 to 300 ms. At all ON-IGC stimulation intervals, ON-evoked MTC spiking was immediately terminated by IGC stimulation (Fig. 6C-F ). To better assess the impact of IGC activation on the ON-evoked MC output, spiking was also normalized to MC spiking within a 300 ms time window immediately following ON stimulation alone (Fig. 6G , right side scale). At stimulation intervals of 0 or 10 ms, the average MTC firing following ON stimulation was reduced to 11.1 Ϯ 6.2% or 63.1 Ϯ 16.2% of baseline firing and 1.5 Ϯ 0.7% or 9.3 Ϯ 2.2% of the ON-evoked firing, respectively (Fig. 6 B, C, G ), indicating that IGC activation strongly inhibits MTC spiking to levels lower than baseline spiking at these short ON-IGC stimulation intervals. When the ON-IGC interval increased from 30 to 300 ms, MTC spiking was truncated upon IGC stimulation. To represent the impact of IGC on ON-evoked MTC spike output in a different analysis window, we quantified the MTC spiking within a 300 ms time window immediately following optical IGC activation. Regardless of when IGC activation occurred, MTC spiking was suppressed below spontaneous baseline level at all tested intervals (Fig. 6G ), demonstrating potent truncation of MTC spike output by the IGC. Thus, selective IGC activation following ON stimulation immediately terminates MTC sensory responses in other glomeruli. IGC activation reduces MTC sensitivity to subsequent sensory input Brief, selective activation of the IGC causes, potent, long-lasting inhibition of MTC firing via direct and indirect pathways. Thus prior IGC activation might generate a long-lasting temporal window in which MTCs in other glomeruli are less sensitive to subsequent sensory input. To test this hypothesis, we recorded MTC response to ON stimulation when preceded by optogenetic activation of the IGC at time intervals from 0 to 600 ms. MTC spiking evoked by ON stimulation (Estim) alone was increased by 669.5 Ϯ 124% over baseline levels (Fig. 7 A, F ) as in the previous experiment. However, ONevoked MTC spiking was strongly inhibited to below the spontaneous baseline levels when preceded by optical stimulation (O-stim) of the IGC within short time windows. At O-stim¡E-stim intervals of 0 or 50 ms ON-evoked spiking was reduced to 9.6 Ϯ 5.6% (n ϭ 12) or 60.4 Ϯ 22% (n ϭ 12) of baseline spiking and 1.5 Ϯ 0.7% or 9.7 Ϯ 3.9% of ON-evoked spiking, respectively (Fig. 7 A, B, C, F ). When IGC activation preceded ON stimulation by 100 -600 ms, ON-evoked MTC spiking incrementally changed from 257.6 Ϯ 85.8% to 422.4 Ϯ 54.2% of spontaneous baseline levels or 33.1 Ϯ 7.6% to 73.9 Ϯ 12.2% of ON-evoked spiking (n ϭ 12; Fig. 7 D, E, F ), indicating significant IGC inhibition of MC response to subsequent ON input. These results demonstrate that, when activity in IGC precedes sensory signals, MTC responses are strongly suppressed. Thus, sensory input to a glomerulus may activate its IGC to suppress MTCs in other glomeruli receiving subsequent sensory signals for hundreds of milliseconds and thus reduce their relative impact on downstream olfactory networks. The IGC inhibits MTCs in vivo A recent in vivo study showed that longduration (10 -500 ms) optogenetic activation of the IGC inhibited spontaneous and odor-evoked MTC firing (Banerjee et al., 2015) . The present in vitro findings predict that brief selective activation of IGC should produce long-lasting inhibition of MTCs in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we used extracellular single-unit recordings in anesthetized intact mice to determine how MTCs respond to a brief (2 ms) optical activation of SACs expressing ChR2 (Fig. 8A ). Optical stimulation was delivered via a 200 m optical fiber positioned vertically above the OB dorsal surface of the medial OB. Previous measures showed that a 2 ms light pulse elicits ϳ4 spikes from ChR2-expressing SACs (Liu et al., 2013) . Although these single brief stimulation pulses elicit transient SAC spiking, they caused potent, long-lasting inhibition of MTC firing when delivered to the OB surface in the vicinity the recorded unit (Fig. 8 B, C ). MTC inhibition lasted for 231.8 Ϯ 10.8 ms (n ϭ 24 units from 8 mice; Fig. 8C ), dramatically longer than the 2 ms optical stimulation. IGC activation of ETCs causes inhibition followed by robust rebound spiking (Liu et al., 2013) . However, in MTCs, there was no significant rebound excitation following IGC inhibition (102.9 Ϯ 8.1% of prestimulation baseline, n ϭ 17, p Ͼ 0.05). These findings demonstrate that brief (2 ms) IGC activation produces strong, long-lasting inhibition of MTC firing in vivo. Mammals sample environmental odors by respiration or active sniffing; thus, the IGC would normally be repetitively activated by sensory input. How does such temporally dynamic IGC activity at sniffing frequencies influence MTC output? To address this question, we investigated repetitive IGC activity impact on MTC output. To approximate sniff-like activation of the IGC, we used trains of five brief (2 ms) light pulses at three different frequencies: 2 Hz (normal mouse respiration rate), 5 Hz and 8 Hz (spanning mouse active sniffing frequencies) (Adrian, 1950; Verhagen et al., 2007) . Each light pulse of the 2 Hz train stimulation produced a long-lasting inhibition of MTC firing equivalent to a single stimulation (215.4 Ϯ 11.2 ms for the first pulse and 187.5 Ϯ 15.5 ms for the fifth pulse; Fig. 8D ; n ϭ 14 units from 5 mice). Thus, at this temporal interval, there is sufficient time for near full recovery to baseline spiking before the next pulse. However, as input frequency was increased to 5 or 8 Hz, MTCs were continuously inhibited throughout the stimulation epoch (Fig. 8D ). Even with high-frequency trains, inhibition was followed by only minor rebound excitation (119.2 Ϯ 11.1% and 126.6 Ϯ 15.9% of prestimulation baseline for 5 Hz and 8 Hz, n ϭ 14, p Ͼ 0.05). These observations demonstrate potent IGC inhibition of the OB output neurons at all tested input frequencies. Inhibition becomes continuous when input frequencies approximates the range of active sniffing. Approximately two-thirds of SACs receive their most effective excitatory drive from ETCs (Kiyokage et al., 2010) , which respond to ON input with a burst of 3-5 spikes with interspike frequency of 50 -100 Hz (Hayar et al., 2004b; Liu and Shipley, 2008b) . Thus, SACs could receive, and potentially generate, a brief burst of spikes. To simulate bursting input patterns from ETCs, we optically activated SACs in vivo with a train of 5 light pulses with intratrain frequency at 50 Hz while recording MTC firing. Greater than 70% of ChR2-positive SACs can follow up to 50 Hz optical stimulation rates eliciting a spike upon each optical pulse (unpublished data). This burst-patterned IGC activation inhibited MTCs for 468.3 Ϯ 26.4 ms with no rebound spiking (105.6 Ϯ 10.9% of prestimulation baseline, n ϭ 14, p Ͼ 0.05; Fig. 8D ). Together, these in vivo findings show that single or functionally relevant patterns of IGC stimulation all produced inhibition of MTC firing that persisted for hundreds of milliseconds after the termination of IGC stimulation. Discussion Olfactory sensory signals are initially processed in the glomeruli, a complex set of direct and indirect, feedforward and feedback, excitatory and inhibitory, and intraglomerular circuit and IGC. The IGC is a prominent lateral network that impacts the initial site of synaptic integration in the olfactory system. Here, we characterized IGC action on MTCs, the principal OB output neurons, with in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology combined with cell type-specific optogenetics (Fig. 9 A, B ) identifying the following: (1) monosynaptic MTC inhibition is mediated by GABA release from SAC¡MTC synapses; (2) gap junction coupling is strong for SAC¡MTC synapses but negligible for SAC¡ETC synapses; (3) brief SAC-MTC inhibition is amplified and temporally prolonged for hundreds of milliseconds by MTC intrinsic properties; (4) IGC-mediated inhibition evokes negligible rebound excitation in MTCs; and (5) IGC stimulation at "sniffing" frequencies above normal respiration produces sustained inhibition of MTCs. How does the IGC inhibit MTCs? At least two indirect pathways can mediate IGC actions on MTCs (Fig. 9B): (1) SAC¡ETC¡MTC and (2) SAC¡ETC¡PG¡MTC. Both pathways begin with SAC¡ETC synapses, which generate a GABA-and DA-mediated sequential inhibition-excitation response in ETCs (Liu et al., 2013) . ETCs provide direct excitatory input to MTCs and to PGCs, which inhibit MTCs (Hayar et al., 2004a; De Saint Jan et al., 2009; Shao et al., 2009 Shao et al., , 2012 Shao et al., , 2013;; Gire et al., 2012) . Thus, the SAC¡ETC¡MTC circuit could decrease ETC¡MTC excitation, whereas the SAC¡ETC¡PG¡MTC circuit might reduce ETC¡PGC inhibitory drive to MTCs resulting in disinhibition (Whitesell et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015) . In either circuit, blocking glutamatergic synapses from ETCs to MTCs or PGCs should block the IGC's impact on MTCs. However, we demonstrated that, when both indirect circuits are blocked, there remains a robust direct, monosynaptic, inhibitory connection from SACs to MTCs. Previous studies reported the absence of a monosynaptic IGC¡MTC connection (Whitesell et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2015) . Several factors might account for this. First, we used adult 8-to 12-week-old mice, whereas the Whitesell et al. (2013) iting DA synthetic enzyme TH on a C57BL/6N genetic background (Savitt et al., 2005) . It is possible that the ChR2 expression in the DAT-Cre mice supports insufficient local membrane depolarization to trigger GABA release or unknown strain differences in the animal's genetic background may play a role. Additional studies are needed to resolve these possibilities, but the present experiments provide unequivocal evidence for a monosynaptic SAC¡MTC inhibitory synapse. Although activation of the IGC could suppress ON-evoked responses in MTCs via the GABA B and/or DA D 2 receptormediated presynaptic inhibition of OSN axon terminals (Berkowicz and Trombley, 2000; Ennis et al., 2001; McGann et al., 2005; Vucinic ´et al., 2006) , the present study showed that the IGC impact on ON-evoked MTC responses is mainly due to postsynaptic action on MTCs: (1) activation of the IGC can terminate MTC responses after an ON stimulation, which can only occur via postsynaptic action; (2) IGC inhibition of MTCs was completely blocked by GBZ, a selective antagonist of GABA A receptors, which would have had no effect on any DA/GABA B mediated presynaptic inhibition; and (3) IGC stimulation blocks MTC responses when delivered within a 0 -50 ms time window before an ON stimulation. This unlikely attributes to presynaptic inhibition of MTCs as the G-protein-coupled GABA B or D 2 receptormediated effects require ϳ75-100 ms activation times (McGann et al., 2005; Shao et al., 2009) , although presynaptic inhibition may help augment postsynaptic inhibition at greater delay intervals. Together, these results indicate that a major action of the IGC is postsynaptic inhibition of MTC. MTC intrinsic properties amplify IGC inhibition MTCs alternate membrane potential between an up-and downstate (Heyward et al., 2001) , driven by a balance between the inward persistent sodium current (I NaP ) (Heyward et al., 2001; Hage and Salkoff, 2012) and outward current(s). MTCs have relatively weak hyperpolarization-activated inward currents (Angelo and Margrie, 2011; Angelo et al., 2012) such that their membrane potential returning to upstate is a slow ramp process (Heyward et al., 2001) . This is consistent with our demonstration that strong and/or synchronous inhibitory IGC input hyperpo-larizes the MTC membrane potential and generates prolonged (ϳ400 ms) inhibition of MTCs. The duration of this inhibition is temporally amplified by MTC intrinsic membrane properties as well as by polysynaptic, indirect circuits. Consequently, the IGC exerts potent, longlasting inhibitory control of MTC output. Thus, circuit-level inhibition is not only a function of presynaptic activity but is also strongly shaped by postsynaptic neuron intrinsic properties. Electrical transmission in the IGC Gap junction-mediated electrical coupling has been reported between MTC apical dendrites (Schoppa and Westbrook, 2002; Christie et al., 2005) and between ETCs (Hayar et al., 2005) . Here we demonstrated strong gap junction electrical coupling between SACs and MTCs. After blocking glutamatergic, GABAergic, and DAergic synapses, optical activation of IGC evoked an inward current in MTCs clamped at resting membrane potential. This inward current persisted for the duration of optical stimulation and was abolished by a gap junction blocker. Recently, electrical synapses between SACs and ETCs were reported (Banerjee et al., 2015) . However, applying the same paradigm used in that study, we showed that the apparent SAC-ETC electrical coupling was entirely blocked or strongly attenuated by DA receptor antagonists. Moreover, with DA action blocked, the residual electrical coupling between SACs and ETCs was negligible at physiological membrane potentials. We conclude that the putative SAC-ETC gap junction current is due to SAC synaptic release of DA, which increases I h and generates an inward current in ETCs. Together, these findings show that SACs selectively form gap junctions with MTCs but not ETCs. Functional impact of the IGC Unlike visual and auditory stimuli that can be defined by wavelength and amplitude, odor information is encoded by spatiotemporal patterns of glomerular activation (Johnson et al., 1998; Mori et al., 1999; Johnson and Leon, 2007) . The pattern of activated glomeruli depends on both the identity and the concentration of the odorant. But the two are potentially confounded: an odorant at a given concentration will activate a pattern of glom- eruli, but increased concentration of the same odorant will activate the same and additional glomeruli yet in most cases so that the odor will be perceived as the same but stronger. The IGC could play a role in disambiguating identity and concentration. The IGCs associated with activated glomeruli would inhibit MTCs in less active glomeruli. Indeed, activation of the IGC positively correlates with odor concentration (Banerjee et al., 2015) . This would tend to decrease the sensitivity of MTCs in less active glomeruli and thus could "normalize" output responses to preserve odor identity in the face of increased concentration. As odorant concentration increases, more "off-target" sensory neurons would engage the IGC circuitry in their glomeruli. Because the IGC of weakly activated glomeruli will also inhibit MTCs in more strongly activated ones, IGC circuitry would also counteract response saturation by increased odorant concentration. Thus, the lateral, feedforward inhibition generated by the IGC could sharpen output contrast within the ensemble of activate glomeruli to preserve odor identity as concentration varies (Aungst et al., 2003; Vucinic ´et al., 2006) . Our findings show that IGC function also has a significant temporal component. When glomeruli are repetitively activated by sniff-like sensory input, the MTC output of less activated glomeruli is truncated by inhibitory IGC input from more strongly activated ones. Moreover, prior activation of the IGC potently suppresses MTC responses in neighboring glomeruli to subsequent sensory activation for hundreds of milliseconds. Glomeruli receiving stronger sensory input are activated slightly earlier than those receiving weaker input (Spors and Grinvald, 2002) . The IGC might amplify this temporal activation advantage. At typical resting respiratory rates (ϳ2 Hz), the impact of preceding IGC activation on MTC responses to subsequent inhalation is modest (ϳ26%). However, as sniffing rate increases, prior activation of the IGC more strongly suppresses MTC responses to sensory input. Thus, we propose that, during brief bouts of high-frequency investigative sniffing, only the most strongly activated glomeruli may transfer signals to downstream circuits. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

There could be an age-dependent maturation of the monosynaptic SAC-MTC connection. Consistent with this possibility, Whitesell et al. (2013) reported that stimulation of distal glomeruli evoked NBQX/APV-resistant IPSCs in a minority of MTCs indicating occasional monosynaptic SAC-MTC connection in younger mice. The major difference between our experiments and those of Banerjee et al. (2015) is that they used mice expressing Cre recombinase under transcriptional control of the DA transporter promoter (DAT-cre mice) with 129 Sv/J genetic background (Zhuang et al., 2005; Banerjee et al., 2015) , whereas we used mice with Cre expression under transcriptional control of the rate lim- Figure 8 . 8 Figure 8.

Introduction Reward is known to effectively facilitate behavior and promote learning (Wise 2004) . Mesolimbic responses to reward, including in the dopaminergic midbrain and the ventral striatum, are considered to be crucial for the acquisition of stimulus-reward associations (Schultz 2004 ). Once a stimulus--reward association is established, mesolimbic neural responses to reward-predicting stimuli are thought to reflect the magnitude and probability of the anticipated reward (Schultz 1997; O'Doherty et al. 2003; Wittmann, et al. 2005; Knutson and Cooper 2005; D'Ardenne et al. 2008; Schott et al. 2008) . While it has been theorized that motivation modulates attention and other cognitive-control processes (e.g., Small et al. 2005; Braver et al. 2007; Locke and Braver 2008; Croxson et al. 2009; Engelmann et al. 2009) , the mechanisms by which reward-driven behavioral facilitation is accomplished are not fully understood. More recently, a debate developed about the uniqueness of the neural signatures of reward-related facilitation, which may help illuminate the mechanisms involved (e.g., Maunsell 2004; Bendiksby and Platt 2006; Pessoa and Engelmann 2010) . In particular, it has been proposed that highly similar neural processes are engaged in response to the anticipation of attentionally demanding tasks, entirely independent of any reward prospect (Nieoullon 2002; Salamone et al. 2005; Arnsten et al. 2009) . In line with this notion, recent observations in humans suggest that the dopaminergic midbrain, in conjunction with cortical control regions, is involved in flexible behavioral adjustments (Boehler, Bunzeck, et al. 2011) and resource recruitment (Boehler, Hopf, et al. 2011) , even in the absence of reward. Furthermore, animal research shows that the dopaminergic midbrain is not only sensitive to reward-related stimuli but also to other salient events including alerting and aversive stimuli (reviewed in Bromberg-Martin et al. 2010 ). Together, these observations suggest that the role of the dopaminergic midbrain goes beyond the mere reflection of incentive value of a given situation, but rather may serve a more complex function in which stimulus valuation and situational processing requirements are integrated, presumably in coordination with other subcortical and cortical circuits. Such a broader role is further supported by findings indicating that the cognitive symptoms in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders are related to pathological changes in the dopaminergic system including Parkinson's disease and addiction (Nieoullon 2002; Everitt and Robbins 2005) . While the above findings provide evidence for the view that reward may act by utilizing processing routes of attentional and executive control systems, a systematic investigation of this proposed overlap, as well as the potential interaction between the 2 factors, is lacking. With the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we sought to pin down neural processes that are shared and distinct between rewarddependent and reward-independent resource recruitment. Specifically, we employed a spatial attention task in which a cue predicted the location and the difficulty level (hard vs. easy) of the upcoming target, as well as the potential to win money in that trial (reward vs. no-reward) . By focusing on the cue phase, which was temporally separated from the actual task execution, we were able to distinguish neural responses reflecting anticipated reward and anticipated difficulty level. Crucially, the brief and temporally unpredictable presentation of the subsequent target required the participants to immediately prepare for the task upon cue presentation, thereby prompting attentional orienting, as well as the pre-target recruitment of cognitive resources. With this design, we could assess the neural underpinnings of the effects of both reward prospect and attentional demand on cognitive resource recruitment and their potential interaction. Materials and Methods Participants and Paradigm Fourteen healthy right-handed participants performed a cued visual discrimination task inside the fMRI scanner (mean age ± standard deviation: 21.7 ± 3.2, 10 female). Three additional participants had to be excluded from the analysis due to poor performance in the discrimination task (1) or poor visual fixation (2). All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Duke Medical Center Institutional Review Board for human subjects and were paid a basic amount of $40 for 2 h plus a reward bonus that depended on task performance averaging about $15. As per an instructional arrow cue at the beginning of each trial, participants were asked to shift their attention covertly to the left or right visual field and to respond quickly to a subsequent target at the cued location (Fig. 1A ). Throughout all experimental runs, a small gray fixation square (0.5°) was visible in the center of a black screen, as well as 2 gray placeholder frames in the left and right lower visual field (6°b elow and 6°lateral of fixation). The arrow cue was presented for 800 ms and could either be blue or green, thereby signaling potentialreward and no-reward trials, respectively. Furthermore, a black or white square embedded in the arrow indicated whether the discrimination difficulty of the upcoming target would be hard or easy, respectively. Reward-predicting as well as difficulty-predicting colors were counterbalanced across participants. After a variable delay, a bilateral stimulus pair was presented in the placeholder boxes for 100 ms, and participants performed a discrimination task on the stimulus in the cued visual hemifield. The oppositehemifield stimulus was included to avoid exogenous attentional capture at the time of the target appearance. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between cue and target was pseudorandomly varied between 1500 and 6000 ms (average SOA = 2500 ms) to promote an effective event-related blood oxygen level--dependent (BOLD)response estimation (Hinrichs et al. 2000) . The target stimuli were gray circles (radius 1°) with 2 gaps opposite from one another that had to be discriminated regarding their size. Participants indicated which gap was larger by pressing the right index finger for ''top gap'' and the right middle finger for ''bottom gap.'' For easy targets, the larger gap subtended a directional angle of 90°versus 40°for hard targets, which therefore affected how hard it was to distinguish it from the opposite smaller gap (20°). The design resulted in a total of 4 main cueing conditions, after collapsing across left and right (Fig. 1B ; ''no-reward easy,'' ''no-reward hard,'' ''reward easy,'' and ''reward hard''). The target display was followed by a visual feedback stimulus (duration = 500 ms; SOA = 1500 ms) indicating whether the response was accurate and fast enough. A variable inter-trial interval of 1000--5500 ms was introduced to separate the feedback from the subsequent cue. Notably, in order to prevent a major asymmetry between conditions, the performance feedback was always informative in both reward and no-reward trials. In potential-reward trials, the feedback additionally indicated a gain or loss of 10 cents (''+10'' vs. ''-10''), whereas the feedback in no-reward trials was accompanied by zeros (''+0'' vs. ''-0''). The response time-out was adjusted dynamically during the experiment based on the individual response-time data to assure a stable positive/negative outcome ratio of 75% to 25% for each participant. This procedure led to a mean gain of $2.5 per run for each participant. At the end of each run, the updated dollar amount was displayed, serving as additional performance feedback. Again, while (A) Each trial started with a colored arrow cue pointing to the target location. Additionally, the cue indicated the difficulty level of the upcoming target discrimination, as well as the potential to win money for accurate performance. After a variable SOA, the target display was briefly presented and participants decided via button press which gap in the target circle was bigger (top vs. bottom). Each trial ended with a visually presented performance feedback. (B) The potential to win money in the current trial (factor Reward) was indicated by the color of the arrow cue (e.g., green 5 reward vs. blue 5 no-reward), while the difficulty level (factor Difficulty) was indicated by the color of the embedded square (e.g., black 5 hard vs. white 5 easy). (C) In terms of the target discrimination performance, both RTs and error rates were affected by Reward and Difficulty, albeit, as expected, in opposite directions. Error bars depict the standard error of the mean across subjects; asterisks indicate significant main effects (***P \ 0.001; **P \ 0.01). participants did not receive monetary feedback in no-reward trials, the routine to provide comparable positive/negative feedback rates was analogous to reward trials to avoid that effects are merely driven by the presence or absence of cognitive performance feedback (Daniel and Pollmann 2010) . Importantly, this dynamic adjustment of the response time-out only affected the visual feedback during the experiment, whereas the behavioral analyses (response time [RT] and error rates) were performed based on the actual responses within a window of 150--1200 ms after target onset. fMRI Data Acquisition Prior to actual scanning, participants performed a 10-minute training session to get familiarized with the task. Inside the scanner, participants performed six 9-minute runs, yielding a total of 114 trials in each experimental condition. Each run included 3 brief performance breaks during the ongoing scanning. fMRI images were acquired using a 3-T GE EXCITE HD scanner with an 8-channel head-coil array. Each functional run consisted of 344 images acquired in an axial slice orientation (30 slices, 3-mm thickness) using an interleaved scanning order (inward-spiral sequence with SENSE acceleration factor of 2, time repetition = 1.5 s, time echo = 25 ms, field of view [FOV] = 192 mm, matrix size of 64 3 64 yielding an in-plane resolution of 3 3 3 mm). The first 5 volumes of each run were discarded to reach steady magnetization. For each participant, a T 1 -weighted high-resolution whole-brain anatomical scan (3D FSPGR sequence, FOV = 256 mm, voxel size of 1 3 1 3 1 mm 3 ) and a high-resolution T 2 -weighted anatomical scan (FOV = 256 mm, voxel size of 1 3 1 3 1 mm 3 ) were acquired to enable spatial coregistration and normalization, as well as to localize subregions of the midbrain, respectively. Participants were instructed to keep accurate central fixation throughout the task and were monitored online using an MR-compatible eye-tracking system (Viewpoint, Arrington Research, Scottsdale, AZ). fMRI Data Analysis Images were preprocessed and analyzed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software package SPM5 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College, London, UK). Anatomical images were coregistered to the SPM template and spatially normalized using the grayand white-matter segmentation routine implemented in SPM5. Functional images were corrected for acquisition delay, spatially realigned, co-registered to the original T 1 -weighted image, and spatially normalized using the parameters used to warp this anatomical image onto the template. After reslicing to a final voxel size of 2 3 2 3 2 mm, functional images were smoothed with an isotropic 6-mm full-width halfmaximum Gaussian kernel. A high-pass temporal filter of 128 s was applied during model estimation (Ashburner and Friston 1999) . A 2-stage model was used for statistical analysis (Friston et al. 1995) . For each experimental condition, BOLD responses were modeled by delta functions at the stimulus onsets for all event types, which were then all convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). The resulting parameters together with the corresponding temporal and dispersion derivatives as well as 6 realignment parameters for each run formed covariates of a general linear model (GLM, Friston et al. 1995) . By decorrelating the cue and target phase, the present design enabled isolation of the activity related to the cue from the activity due to all other events (targets, feedback, and breaks), which were modeled as regressors of no interest. Individual participants' contrast images were entered into a repeated-measures analysis of variances (rANOVA; false discovery rate (FDR)--corrected significance threshold P < 0.05, voxel-extent threshold k > 15) with factors ''Reward'' and ''Difficulty'' as implemented in SPM5 to investigate the main effects and interaction between the 2 factors. In order to define overlapping activations and deactivations associated with both reward and difficulty, the main effects were subsequently submitted to a conjunction analysis (FDR-corrected P < 0.05, voxel-extent threshold k > 15). To further illustrate the rANOVA results, we extracted the mean BOLD signal changes from selected regions of interest (ROIs) using the MarsBaR analysis toolbox (Brett et al. 2002) . ROIs were defined as spheres centered at the local activity maxima derived from the conjunction between the 2 voxel-wise main effects, as well as from the selective main effects and their interaction (radius 4 mm; within midbrain 2 mm). It should be emphasized that these ROI-based values serve to illustrate the overlapping main effects of anticipated reward and anticipated difficulty rather than being statistically inferential (Kriegeskorte et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, the observed main effects in regions that concomitantly exhibited a voxel-wise interaction should be interpreted in the light of this higher order effect. It is important to note that the analysis of the imaging data was entirely focused on the cue phase in order to investigate attentional orienting and resource recruitment during the anticipation of a target independent of the actual execution of the discrimination task. Results Behavioral Results Most participants maintained very accurate fixation, and no differential effects of eye-position deviations were observed between conditions. However, 2 additional participants had to be excluded from further analyses due to extensive eye movements (see Materials and Methods). Initially, RT and accuracy data were submitted to a 2 3 2 3 2 rANOVA with factors Reward, Difficulty, and Side (target in left vs. right visual field). Since there was no interaction between any of the main factors and Side (all P > 0.3), the data were collapsed across target side and tested via 2 3 2 rANOVAs. Target responses were faster and more accurate following reward as compared with no-reward cues (RTs: Reward: F 1,13 = 24.58, P < 0.001; Error rate: F 1,13 = 19.93, P = 0.001). Furthermore, on difficult as compared with easy targets, RTs were significantly slower (Difficulty: F 1,13 = 59.99, P < 0.001) and participants committed more errors (F 1,13 = 87.33, P < 0.001). The reward-related RT decrease was more pronounced for easy targets, which was reflected in an interaction between Reward and Difficulty (F 1,13 = 9.05, P = 0.01) and confirmed by a significant post hoc t-test comparing the RT difference between easy versus hard targets in reward and no-reward trials, respectively (t 13 = 3.01, P = 0.01). No interaction effect was observed regarding error rates (P > 0.5). Cue-Related Modulations of Reward and Difficulty Anticipation The whole-brain rANOVA focusing on the cue phase revealed main effects of both reward and difficulty anticipation in a widespread network of cortical and subcortical regions (Tables 1 and 2 ). The most prominent activations associated with reward as compared with no-reward cues included the dorsal striatum (encompassing both the caudate head and body), the ventral striatum (encompassing the nucleus accumbens [NAcc] and ventral putamen), the mesencephalic substantianigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) complex, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and anterior insula, anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), calcarine sulcus (V1), posterior thalamus, and superior colliculi (for a complete overview, see Table 1 ). In addition, significantly larger deactivations for reward as compared with no-reward cues were found in regions of the default-mode network, including the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the dorsomedial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, vmPFC), the caudal PCC and precuneus region, and the hippocampus. Cue-related anticipation of hard as compared with easy targets induced activity increases in the dorsal striatum (caudate head and body), the SN/VTA complex, IFG and anterior insula, IPS, aMCC and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) extending into the inferior frontal junction, posterior thalamus, and the superior colliculi (for a complete overview, see Table 2 ). Similar to reward-predicting cues, cues predicting difficult versus easy targets led to significant deactivations in the default-mode network of attention. Note that the main effects in regions that were accompanied by a significant interaction in the voxel-wise analysis should be interpreted in the light of the respective higher order interaction effects (see Interaction between Cue-Related Reward and Difficulty Anticipation). Comparison of the Observed Cue-Related Main Effects To illustrate the considerable regional overlap between the anticipation of reward and difficulty, the associated main effects were submitted to a conjunction analysis (see Table 3 , Fig. 2 ). BOLD signal change values were extracted based on the local activity maxima in this conjunction and averaged across left and right cues and across hemispheres (provided those regions exhibited comparable bilateral activation patterns). The majority of the activated regions, including IFG, IPS, dorsal striatum (caudate head), and the SN/VTA complex, were independently activated by both reward and difficulty anticipation, resulting in a mostly additive effect on the BOLD signal (Fig. 2A , upper panel). Analogously, regions of the default-mode network, including STG, dmPFC, vmPFC, and PCC/precuneus, were similarly deactivated by reward and difficulty anticipation, again in an additive way (Fig. 2A , lower panel). Beyond these additive effects of reward and difficulty anticipation, several regions were predominantly modulated by only one dimension of the cue stimulus (Fig. 2B ). Specifically, the anticipation of reward primarily engaged the ventral striatum (encompassing the NAcc), the calcarine sulcus in the occipital cortex (V1), and the PCC (not shown), while the anticipation of difficulty primarily engaged the pre-SMA and the dlPFC. To test for potential modulations by the respective opposite factor in these 5 regions, we extracted the BOLD signal change for all 4 conditions. Note that the signal change values (Fig. 2B ) representing the originally contrasted conditions on which the ROI selection was based upon (for reward: ''reward'' vs. ''no-reward''; for difficulty: ''hard'' vs. easy'') are merely included for completeness rather than being inferential as they naturally reflect the voxel-wise main effects ( Kriegeskorte et al. 2009 ). The only regions of these 2 sets that were significantly modulated by the respective other factor, that is, reward-related regions modulated by difficulty, were the left ventral striatum (t 13 = 2.86, P = 0.014) and bilateral V1 (left: t 13 = 2.23, P = 0.044; right: t 13 = 2.86, P = 0.013), as indicated by significant paired t-tests between hard versus easy cues (all other P values > 0.2). Interaction between Cue-Related Reward and Difficulty Anticipation Importantly, in addition to the main effects in partly overlapping and partly selective regions, the rANOVA revealed a significant voxel-wise interaction for the cue-related activity between the 2 factors (Table 4 ; Fig. 3 ) in the SN/VTA complex, the posterior thalamus/pulvinar, the right caudate body, and the right aMCC. The pattern of BOLD signal change extracted from ROIs centered at the respective local activity maxima show that the interaction in all these regions reflected a highly selective activity increase for cues that predicted both reward and high difficulty as compared with all other cue types. To relate the cue-related neural activity in the regions exhibiting such an interaction to the performance in the discrimination task, the BOLD signal change derived from these regions (i.e., VTA, thalamus, caudate body, and aMCC) was submitted to an across-subjects correlational analysis with their RT measures. We found that an increase in the neural signal within the VTA was associated with a reduced RT disadvantage in difficult trials (i.e., performance improvement), as indicated by a negative correlation between the difference in the cued-related BOLD signal (hard minus easy trials) and the respective difference in RT (r = -0.69, P = 0.006). Hence, greater VTA activity was associated with faster responses in difficult trials. Importantly, this effect was primarily driven by the reward trials, as indicated by a significant correlation when considering reward trials alone (hard minus easy: r = -0.66, P = 0.010), but no correlation when considering no-reward trials alone (hard minus easy: r = 0.13, P = 0.658). In addition, neural activity in the right caudate body was correlated with faster responses in reward as compared with no-reward trials (r = -.61, P = 0.020). Discussion In the current fMRI study, we used a spatial cuing paradigm in which a trial-by-trial cue not only predicted the location of an upcoming target but also its discrimination difficulty (hard vs. easy) and the potential to win money in that trial (reward vs. no-reward). As expected, we found that the prospect of reward facilitated target discrimination performance. Moreover, our task-difficulty manipulation was very effective as well, in that participants were slower and less accurate in the hard discrimination condition. On the neural level, during the cuing phase for the anticipation of reward and the anticipation of high task demands, we observed strikingly overlapping activations in a widespread network, including the IFG and anterior insula region, the IPS, the dorsal striatum, the aMCC, the thalamus, and the mesencephalic SN/VTA complex. These shared neural modulations support the view that information about potential reward and task demands triggers highly similar processes that have been linked to attentional control (Kastner et al. 1999; Gitelman et al. 1999; Hopfinger et al. 2000; Corbetta and Shulman 2002; Woldorff et al. 2004 ). In keeping with this notion, reward seems to act by utilizing and modulating attentional processes that are typically also employed in endogenous attentional control, as has been suggested (e.g., Pessoa and Engelmann 2010) , rather than by triggering a cascade that is highly unique to reward. The observed deactivation pattern in default-mode regions further supports this notion as activity in this network typically decreases as attentional demands, and ultimately attentional control, increase (Gusnard et al. 2001; Raichle et al. 2001 ). In the present study, both reward-predicting and difficulty-predicting trials share a common neural pattern, that is, greater deactivation during reward versus no-reward and hard versus easy trials, thereby mirroring the activity pattern in attentional control regions. In turn, these deactivations are likely related to a reduced vulnerability to attentional lapses, which have been associated with increased default-mode activity (Weissman et al. 2006) . While earlier studies provided evidence for a functional overlap between cognitive-control processes related to reward and attentional control, using either reward (e.g., Engelmann et al. 2009) or task demands (e.g., Boehler, Hopf, et al. 2011) , we now explicitly delineate the neural communalities and interactions of these factors by incorporating these manipulations in a fully crossed factorial design within the same study. Moreover, the current results show for the first time that stimulus processing in a number of these regions appears to be modulated in an additive way, with highest activity levels for cues predicting both reward and high task demands, comparable intermediate activity levels for cues predicting only one of the 2, and lowest levels for cues predicting neither. Despite this functional overlap in the attention and defaultmode networks, some regions were predominantly sensitive to only one type of salient information provided by the cue. In particular, the ventral striatum, as well as the PCC and visual cortex (V1), showed clearly enhanced responses during the anticipation of reward as compared with anticipation of higher task difficulty. The cluster in the ventral part of the striatum likely comprises the NAcc (as well as ventral parts of the putamen), an area that has been established as being one of the most important target areas of the dopaminergic projections from the midbrain (Wise 2004; Haber and Knutson 2010) . The reward-related response in this region is in line with the prototypical reward-anticipation response that is thought to signal the incentive value of a stimulus (Knutson et al. 2001; Schultz 2002; Wise 2004; Knutson and Gibbs 2007) . Similarly, the rostral part of the PCC has been shown to be involved in the processing of reward-related stimuli (Knutson et al. 2001; Small et al. 2005; Platt and Huettel 2008) . While being particularly modulated by the prospect of reward, the left ventral striatum and bilateral V1 were to some extent also 3 ). (B) In addition, anticipated reward increased activity within bilateral ventral striatum, V1, and PCC (not shown), while anticipated difficulty increased activity within bilateral pre-SMA and dlPFC. Bar graphs represent BOLD signal values extracted based on the local maxima of the respective main effects (Tables 1 and 2 ). sensitive to anticipated difficulty, as revealed by comparing the extracted BOLD signal change in these regions from hard and easy trials. These additional modulations are consistent with our recent observations of difficulty-related signals in these regions in the absence of reward (Boehler, Hopf, et al. 2011) . Importantly, as compared with this latter finding, the present design allowed us to clearly associate the neural activity to cue processing alone, that is, independent of target processing. However, on the voxel-wise level, the anticipation of high task difficulty was not sufficient to trigger activity in these regions in the present experiment, suggesting a greater behavioral relevance of reward-predicting as compared with difficultypredicting cues. These differential effects of anticipated reward and anticipated difficulty may in turn be related to the notion that reward associations impart greater motivational value and higher prioritization of an event fairly automatically (Serences 2008; Kiss et al. 2009 ). Anticipation of greater task difficulty, in and of itself, led to increased activity in medial frontal and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Specifically, cues predicting hard as compared with easy targets were associated with activity in the pre-SMA in the medial frontal wall, a region that has been implicated in cognitive-control and attention processes and is known to be modulated by task demands (e.g., Brass and von Cramon 2002; Cole and Schneider 2007) . Similarly, the dlPFC, and in particular the inferior frontal junction, has been associated with a variety of cognitive-control functions, including the representation and maintenance of task sets (e.g., Banich et al. 2000; Brass and von Cramon 2002; Derrfuss et al. 2004; Cole and Schneider 2007; Menon and Uddin 2010) . Together, the observed frontal activations during the anticipation of high versus low task difficulty are therefore likely to reflect increased top-down executive control during the preparation for a highly demanding task as compared with an easy one. In addition, with regard to the important question of how information about reward and task demands is integrated on a neural level, we found significant voxel-wise interactions in the medial dopaminergic midbrain, along with other subcortical regions and the aMCC, reflecting selective activity enhancement in response to difficult cues that were concomitantly predictive of reward. It has been recently suggested that the dopaminergic midbrain is involved in the flexible recruitment of cognitive resources to meet varying task demands (Nieoullon 2002; Arnsten et al. 2009; Boehler, Bunzeck, et al. 2011; Boehler, Hopf, et al. 2011) , a role that goes beyond the mere coding of incentive values. However, it remained unclear whether these 2 functions are mutually independent processes that would result in a mostly additive, independent set of effects, or whether they would interact if triggered concomitantly. Although the overlap in attentional control regions during reward-predicting and difficulty-predicting cues in the present study suggests that highly similar mechanisms are employed, the interaction pattern in the dopaminergic midbrain indicates that difficulty alone may not automatically prompt maximal recruitment of processing resources in the context of a reward paradigm. The results of the present study suggest instead that additional resources may be invested to accomplish a demanding task particularly when it seems worth the effort. This notion is further supported by the observation that greater VTA activity in response to the cue was correlated with a smaller difficulty-related RT disadvantage across subjects if the present trial was rewarded. Such a mechanism would thus go beyond merely signaling the incentive value of a given situation, thereby emphasizing the role of the dopaminergic system within a broader framework of ''motivational control'' and its role in the allocation of processing resources to control and adapt behavior (Jocham and Moreover, it has been demonstrated that prototypical mesolimbic reward anticipation responses to an incentive cue are actually diminished if mental effort has to be invested over a longer time in a subsequent task to obtain the reward-a phenomenon that has been described as ''effort discounting'' (Botvinick et al. 2009; Croxson et al. 2009; Kool et al. 2010 ). Accordingly, if the observed interaction would be primarily driven by the mere representation of incentive value, we would expect to have found the opposite pattern from what we observed in the present study-that is, an attenuation of the response for high as compared with low difficulty trials. In contrast, we found a selective activity boost in response to cues that predicted both reward and high difficulty, supporting the notion that the dopaminergic midbrain is involved in increased resource recruitment when this is particularly needed or desired (Nieoullon 2002; Salamone et al. 2005; Arnsten et al. 2009) . With respect to the effort-discounting literature, it is important to note, however, that our paradigm required participants to immediately prepare for the upcoming target once the cue was presented, thereby emphasizing resource recruitment rather than mere valuation of the cue, which in turn likely gave rise to an additive rather than discounting effect of task load on reward anticipation (cf. Croxson et al. 2009) . The interaction pattern in the midbrain was paralleled by a similar interaction effect in the caudate body, the aMCC, and the posterior thalamus. Previous studies have indicated that the anterior cingulate cortex and the caudate nucleus are particularly sensitive to different kinds of behaviorally salient events, including those associated with reward (Downar et al. 2002; Zink et al. 2004; Davidson et al. 2004; Zink et al. 2006; Seeley et al. 2007 ). It has been furthermore suggested that the anterior cingulate cortex may represent a neural ''hub'' that helps prioritize stimulus processing and action selection by integrating multiple salient inputs (Downar et al. 2002; Rushworth et al. 2007; Pessoa and Engelmann 2010) . More recently, a similar integrative and modulatory role has been suggested for the thalamus due to its role as a critical relay structure between cortical and subcortical regions (for a review, see Haber and Calzavara 2009) . Despite being considered one of the major target regions of dopaminergic midbrain neurons, the ventral striatum did not entirely mirror the neural response within the VTA. This dissociation likely arises from the complex connectivity patterns of the ventral striatum with subcortical and cortical regions. More specifically, it is likely that in complex task settings such as in the present study, the ventral striatal response is a product of the dopaminergic input from the midbrain and interactions with prefrontal regions (Wise 2004) . In this context, it should be noted that modulations of fMRI signals in the dopaminergic midbrain and its target regions cannot be automatically equated with dopaminergic neurotransmission, although a body of evidence has been accumulating for this relationship (e.g., Knutson and Gibbs 2007; Schott et al. 2008; Buckholtz et al. 2010) . In addition, it has been recently argued (D'Ardenne et al. 2008 ) that whole-head group-level fMRI approaches can be problematic for the investigation of the midbrain due to its small size and proximity to blood vessels (but see Duzel et al. 2009) . To ameliorate such problems, we optimized our data-acquisition approach, including implementing high-resolution functional matrices and optimized co-registration procedures that incorporate T 2 -weighted anatomical scans to provide an excel-lent anatomical contrast and thus the ability to accurately locate mesencephalic subregions. Together, the present findings suggest that information about reward value and the expected difficulty to obtain the reward is integrated by means of interactions between the dopimanergic midbrain and cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits, contributing to the modulation of resource recruitment in order to facilitate performance when it appears particularly worthwhile. It should be noted, however, that such a mechanism is likely to be highly dependent on the task context. In particular, the context of reward might generally shift resourcerecruitment strategies by incorporating information about both value and task demands to prioritize resource allocation in trials in which higher effort is most likely to pay off. In contrast, in the absence of reward, high levels of perceptual difficulty, working memory load, or stimulus conflict could be sufficient to drive a similar cascade in a self-propelling manner.

(B) The potential to win money in the current trial (factor Reward) was indicated by the color of the arrow cue (e.g., green 5 reward vs. blue 5 no-reward), while the difficulty level (factor Difficulty) was indicated by the color of the embedded square (e.g., black 5 hard vs. white 5 easy). (C) In terms of the target discrimination performance, both RTs and error rates were affected by Reward and Difficulty, albeit, as expected, in opposite directions. Error bars depict the standard error of the mean across subjects; asterisks indicate significant main effects (***P \ 0.001; **P \ 0.01). Figure 2 . 2 Figure2. Neural modulations of cue-related reward and difficulty anticipation. (A) Activations associated with the main effect of reward (green) are overlaid with activations associated with the main effect of difficulty (black) in a conjunction contrast with a display cutoff at a significance threshold of P \ 0.001. Both anticipated reward and anticipated difficulty increased activity within overlapping cortical and subcortical attentional control regions (upper panel) and decreased activity within overlapping regions of the default-mode network (lower panel). Bar graphs represent BOLD signal values extracted based on the local maxima of the conjunction analysis (Table3). (B) In addition, anticipated reward increased activity within bilateral ventral striatum, V1, and PCC (not shown), while anticipated difficulty increased activity within bilateral pre-SMA and dlPFC. Bar graphs represent BOLD signal values extracted based on the local maxima of the respective main effects (Tables1 and 2).

The right SN/VTA complex, posterior thalamus, right caudate body, and the right aMCC exhibited a significant interaction between anticipated reward and difficulty in the voxel-wise rANOVA. The BOLD signal change values revealed that this effect was driven by a selective activity increase for cues predicting both reward and high difficulty.

Main Text Introductory paragraph Prostate cancers remain indolent in the majority of patients but behave aggressively in a minority 1, 2 . However, the molecular basis for this clinical heterogeneity remains incompletely understood [3] [4] [5] . Here, we characterize a novel lncRNA termed SChLAP1 (Second Chromosome Locus Associated with Prostate-1, HGNC #48603) overexpressed in a subset of prostate cancers. SChLAP1 levels independently predicted for poor patient outcomes, including metastasis and prostate cancer specific mortality. In vitro and in vivo gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments indicated that SChLAP1 is critical for cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. Mechanistically, SChLAP1 antagonized the genome-wide localization and regulatory functions of the SWI/SNF chromatin-modifying complex. These results suggest that SChLAP1 contributes to the development of lethal cancer at least in part by antagonizing tumor-suppressive functions of the SWI/SNF complex. Manuscript text With over 200,000 diagnoses per year, 1 in 6 U.S. men are diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Yet, only 20% of prostate cancer patients have a high-risk cancer that represents possibly lethal disease 1, 2, 4 . While mutational events in key genes characterizes a subset of lethal prostate cancers 3, 5, 6 , the molecular basis for aggressive disease remains poorly understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA species >200bp in length that are frequently polyadenylated and associated with transcription by RNA polymerase II 7 . lncRNA-mediated biology has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes and in cancer, lncRNAs are emerging as a prominent layer of transcriptional regulation, often by collaborating with epigenetic complexes [7] [8] [9] [10] . Here, we hypothesized that prostate cancer aggressiveness was governed by uncharacterized lncRNAs and sought to discover lncRNAs associated with aggressive disease. We previously used RNA-Seq to describe 121 novel lncRNA loci (out of >1,800) that were aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer tissues 11 . Because only a fraction of prostate cancers present with aggressive clinical features 2 , we performed cancer outlier profile analysis 11 (COPA) to nominate intergenic lncRNAs selectively upregulated in a subset of cancers (Supplementary Table 1 ). We observed that only two, PCAT-109 and PCAT-114, which are both located in a "gene desert" on Chromosome 2q31.3 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), showed striking outlier profiles and ranked among the best outliers in prostate cancer 11 (Fig. 1a ). Of the two, PCAT-114 was expressed at higher levels in prostate cell lines, and in the PCAT-114 region we defined a 1.4 kb, polyadenylated gene composed of up to seven exons and spanning nearly 200kb on Ch2q31.3 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a ). We named this gene Second Chromosome Locus Associated with Prostate-1 (SChLAP1) after its genomic location. Published prostate cancer ChIP-Seq data 12 confirmed that the transcriptional start site (TSS) of SChLAP1 was marked by H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and its gene body harbored H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) (Fig. 1b ), an epigenetic signature consistent with lncRNAs 13 . We observed numerous SChLAP1 splicing isoforms of which three (termed isoforms #1, #2, and #3, respectively) constituted the vast majority (>90%) of transcripts in the cell (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c ). Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we validated that SChLAP1 was highly expressed in ∼25% of prostate cancers (Fig. 1c ). SChLAP1 prevalence was more frequent in metastatic compared to localized prostate cancers and was associated with ETS gene fusions in this cohort but not other molecular events (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e ). A computational analysis of the SChLAP1 sequence suggested no coding potential, which was confirmed experimentally by in vitro translation assays of three SChLAP1 isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Additionally, we found that SChLAP1 transcripts were located in the nucleus (Fig. 1d ). We confirmed the nuclear localization of SChLAP1 in human samples (Fig. 1e ) using an in situ hybridization (ISH) assay in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate cancers (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Note). An analysis of SChLAP1 expression in localized tumors demonstrated a striking correlation with higher Gleason scores, a histopathological measure of aggressiveness (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Table 2 ). Next, we performed a network analysis of prostate cancer microarray data in the Oncomine 14 database using signatures of SChLAP1-correlated or -anti-correlated genes, given that SChLAP1 is not measured by expression microarrays (Supplementary Table 3a and Online Methods). We found a remarkable association with enriched concepts related to prostate cancer progression (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3b ). For comparison, we next incorporated disease signatures using prostate RNA-seq data as well as additional known prostate cancer genes: EZH2, a metastasis gene 15 , PCA3, a lncRNA biomarker 4 , AMACR, a tissue biomarker 4 , and β-actin (ACTB) as a control (Supplementary Fig. 5 , Supplementary Tables 3c-i, and Supplementary Note). A heat-map visualization of significant comparisons confirmed a strong association of SChLAP1correlated genes, but not PCA3-and AMACR-correlated genes, with high-grade and metastatic cancers (Fig. 2b ). Kaplan-Meier analysis similarly showed significant associations between the SChLAP1 signature and biochemical recurrence 16 and overall survival 17 (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b ). To evaluate SChLAP1 levels with clinical outcomes directly, we next used SChLAP1 expression to stratify 235 radical prostatectomy localized prostate cancer patients from the Mayo Clinic 18 (Supplementary Fig. 6c and Online Methods). Samples were evaluated for three clinical endpoints: biochemical recurrence (BCR), clinical progression to systemic disease (CP), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) (Supplementary Table 4 ). At the time of this analysis, patients had a median follow-up of 8.1 years. SChLAP1 was a powerful single-gene predictor of aggressive prostate cancer (Fig. 2c-e ). SChLAP1 expression was highly significant when distinguishing CP and PCSM (p = 0.00005 and p = 0.002, respectively) (Fig. 2d, e ). For the BCR endpoint, high SChLAP1 expression was associated with a rapid median time-to-progression (1.9 vs 5.5 years for SChLAP1 high and low patients, respectively) (Fig. 2c ). We further confirmed that this association with rapid BCR using an independent cohort (Supplementary Fig. 6d ). Multivariable and univariable regression analyses of the Mayo Clinic data demonstrated that SChLAP1 expression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer aggressiveness with highly significant hazard ratios for predicting BCR, CP, and PCSM (HR or 3.045, 3.563, and 4.339, respectively, p < 0.01) which were comparable to other clinical factors such as advanced clinical stage and the Gleason histopathological score (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note). To explore the functional role for SChLAP1, we performed siRNA knockdowns to compare the impact of SChLAP1 depletion to that of EZH2, which is essential for cancer cell aggressiveness 15 . Remarkably, knockdown of SChLAP1 dramatically impaired cell invasion and proliferation in vitro at a level comparable to EZH2 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 8a, b ). Overexpression of a siRNA-resistant SChLAP1 isoform rescued the in vitro invasive phenotype of 22Rv1 cells treated with siRNA-2 (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d ). Next, overexpression of three SChLAP1 isoforms in RWPE benign immortalized prostate cells dramatically increased the ability of these cells to invade in vitro but did not impact cell proliferation (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 8e, f ). To test SChLAP1 in vivo, we performed intracardiac injection of 22Rv1 cells stably knocking down SChLAP1 (Supplementary Fig. 9a ) and observed that SChLAP1 depletion impaired metastatic seeding and growth by luciferase signaling at both proximal (lungs) and distal sites (Fig. 3c, d ). Indeed, 22Rv1 shSChLAP1 cells displayed both fewer gross metastatic sites overall as well as smaller metastatic tumors when they did form (Fig. 3d, e ). Histopathological analysis of the metastatic 22Rv1 tumors, regardless of SChLAP1 knockdown, showed uniformly high-grade epithelial cancer (Supplementary Fig. 9b ). Interestingly, shSChLAP1 subcutaneous xenografts displayed slower tumor progression; however this was due to delayed tumor engraftment rather than decreased tumor growth kinetics with no change in Ki67 staining observed between shSChLAP1 and shNT cells (Supplementary Fig. 9c-i ). Next, using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay 19 , we found that 22Rv1 shSChLAP1 #1 cells, which have depleted expression of both isoforms 1 and 2, demonstrated a greatly reduced ability to invade, intravasate and metastasize distant organs (Fig. 3f-h ). Additionally, shSChLAP1 cells also showed decreased tumor growth (Fig. 3i ). Importantly, overexpression of RWPE-SChLAP1 isoform #1 cells partially recapitulated these results, displaying a markedly increased ability to intravasate (Fig. 3j ). RWPE-SChLAP1 cells did not generate distant metastases or cause altered tumor growth in this model (data not shown). Together, the murine metastasis and CAM data strongly implicate SChLAP1 in tumor invasion and metastasis through cancer cell intravasation, extravasation, and subsequent tumor cell seeding. To elucidate mechanisms of SChLAP1 function, we profiled 22Rv1 and LNCaP SChLAP1knockdown cells, which revealed 165 upregulated and 264 downregulated genes (q-value < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 10a and Supplementary Table 5a ). After ranking genes according to differential expression 20 , we employed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 21 to search for enrichment across the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) 22 . Among the highest ranked concepts we noticed genes positively or negatively correlated with the SWI/SNF complex 23 , which was independently confirmed using gene signatures generated from our RNA-Seq data (Supplementary Fig. 10b-e , and Supplementary Table 5b ,c). Importantly, SChLAP1-regulated genes were inversely correlated with these datasets, suggesting that SChLAP1 and SWI/SNF function in opposing manners. The SWI/SNF complex regulates gene transcription as a multi-protein system that physically move nucleosomes at gene promoters 24 . Loss of SWI/SNF functionality promotes cancer progression and multiple SWI/SNF components are somatically inactivated in cancer 24, 25 . SWI/SNF mutations do occur in prostate cancer albeit not commonly 3 , and down-regulation of SWI/SNF complex members characterizes subsets of prostate cancer 23, 26 . Thus, antagonism of SWI/SNF activity by SChLAP1 is consistent with the oncogenic behavior of SChLAP1 and the tumor suppressive behavior of the SWI/SNF complex. To directly test whether SChLAP1 antagonizes SWI/SNF-mediated regulation, we performed siRNA knockdown of SNF5 (also known as SMARCB1) (Supplementary Fig. 10f ), an essential subunit that facilitates SWI/SNF binding to histone proteins 24, 25, 27 , and confirmed predicted expression changes for several SChLAP1 or SNF5-regulated genes (Supplementary Fig. 10g, h ). A comparison of genes regulated by knockdown of SNF5 to genes regulated by SChLAP1 demonstrated an antagonistic relationship where SChLAP1 knockdown affected the same genes as SNF5 but in the opposing direction (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 5d-h). We used GSEA to quantify and verify the significance of these findings (FDR < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 10i-k ). Furthermore, a shared SNF5-SChLAP1 signature of co-regulated genes was highly enriched for prostate cancer clinical signatures for disease aggressiveness (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 5i ). Mechanistically, although SChLAP1 and SNF5 mRNA levels were comparable (Supplementary Fig. 12a ), SChLAP1 knockdown or overexpression did not alter SNF5 protein abundance (Supplementary Fig. 12b ), suggesting that SChLAP1 regulates SWI/SNF activity post-translationally. To explore this possibility, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation assays (RIP) for SNF5. We found that endogenous SChLAP1, but not other cytoplasmic or nuclear lncRNAs 7, 28 , robustly co-immunoprecipitated with SNF5 in both native (Fig. 4b ) and UV-crosslinked conditions (Supplementary Fig. 12c ) as well as with a second SNF5 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 12d ). In contrast, SChLAP1 did not coimmunoprecipitate with androgen receptor (Fig. 4b ). Furthermore, both SChLAP1 isoform #1 and isoform #2 co-immunoprecipitated with SNF5 in RWPE overexpression models (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 12e ). SNRNP70 binding to the U1 RNA was used as a technical control in all cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 12f, g ). Finally, pulldown of the SChLAP1 RNA in RWPE-SChLAP1 isoform #1 cells robustly recovered SNF5 protein, confirming this interaction (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 12h ). To address whether SChLAP1 modulated SWI/SNF genomic binding, we performed ChIP-Seq of SNF5 in RWPE-LacZ and RWPE-SChLAP1 cells and called significantly enriched peaks with respect to an IgG control (Supplementary Table 6a and Online Methods). Western blot validations confirmed SNF5 pull-down by ChIP (Supplementary Fig. 13a ), After aggregating called peaks from all samples, we found 6,235 genome-wide binding sites for SNF5 (FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Table 6b ), which were highly enriched for sites near gene promoters (Supplementary Fig. 13b ), supporting previous studies of SWI/SNF binding [29] [30] [31] . A comparison of SNF5 binding across these 6,235 genomic sites demonstrated a dramatic decrease in SNF5 genomic binding as a result of SChLAP1 overexpression (Fig. 4e ,f and Supplementary Fig. 13c ). Of the 1,299 SNF5 peaks occurring within 1kb of a gene promoter, 390 decreased ≥2-fold in relative SNF5 binding (Supplementary Fig. 13d and Supplementary Table 6c ). To verify these findings independently, we performed ChIP for SNF5 in 22Rv1 sh-SChLAP1 cells, with the hypothesis that knockdown of SChLAP1 should increase SNF5 genomic binding compared to controls. We found that 9 of 12 target genes showed a substantial increase in SNF5 binding (Supplementary Fig. 14a ), confirming our predictions. Finally, we used expression profiling of RWPE-LacZ and RWPE-SChLAP1 cells to characterize the relationship between SNF5 binding and SChLAP1-mediated gene expression changes. After identifying a gene signature with highly significant expression changes (Supplementary Table 6d ), we intersected this signature with the ChIP-Seq data. We observed that a significant subset of genes with ≥2-fold relative decrease in SNF5 genomic binding were dysregulated when SChLAP1 was overexpressed (Supplementary Fig. 14b ). Decreased SNF5 binding was primarily associated with downregulation of target gene expression (Supplementary Table 6e ), although the SWI/SNF complex is known to regulate expression in either direction 24, 25 . An integrative GSEA analysis of the microarray and SNF5 ChIP-Seq data demonstrated a significant enrichment for genes that were repressed when SChLAP1 was overexpressed (q-value = 0.003, Fig. 4g ). Overall, these data argue that SChLAP1 overexpression antagonizes SWI/SNF complex function by attenuating the genomic binding of this complex, thereby impairing its ability to regulate gene expression properly. Here, we have discovered SChLAP1, a highly prognostic lncRNA that is abundantly expressed in ∼25% of prostate cancers and aided the discrimination of aggressive from indolent forms of this disease. Mechanistically, we find that SChLAP1 coordinates cancer cell invasion in vitro and metastatic spread in vivo. Moreover, we characterize an antagonistic SChLAP1-SWI/SNF axis in which SChLAP1 impairs SNF5-mediated gene expression regulation and genomic binding (Supplementary Fig. 14c ). Thus, while other lncRNAs such as HOTAIR and HOTTIP are known to assist epigenetic complexes such as PRC2 and MLL by facilitating their genomic binding and enhancing their functions 8, 9, 32 , SChLAP1 is the first lncRNA, to our knowledge, that impairs a major epigenetic complex with well-documented tumor suppressor function [23] [24] [25] [33] [34] [35] . Taken ogether, our discovery of SChLAP1 has broad implications for cancer biology and provides supporting evidence for the role of lncRNAs in the progression of aggressive cancers. Online Methods Experimental studies Cell lines-All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell lines were maintained using standard media and conditions. Specifically, VCaP and Du145 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus 1% penicillin-streptomycin. LNCaP and 22Rv1 were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) plus 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. RWPE cells were maintained in KSF media (Invitrogen) plus 10ng/mL EGF (Sigma) and bovine pituitary extract (BPE) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cell lines were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 cell culture incubator. All cell lines were genotyped for identity at the University of Michigan Sequencing Core and tested routinely for Mycoplasma contamination. SChLAP1 or control-expressing cell lines were generated by cloning SChLAP1 or control into the pLenti6 vector (Invitrogen) using pcr8 non-directional Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) as an initial cloning vector and shuttling to pLenti6 using LR clonase II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably-transfected RWPE and 22Rv1 cells were selected using blasticidin (Invitrogen) for one week. For LNCAP and 22Rv1 cells with stable knockdown of SChLAP1, cells were transfected with SChLAP1 or non-targeting shRNA lentiviral constructs for 48 hours. GFP+ cells were selected with 1ug/mL puromycin for 72 hours. All lentiviruses were generated by the University of Michigan Vector Core. Tissue Samples-Prostate tissues were obtained from the radical prostatectomy series and Rapid Autopsy Program at the University of Michigan tissue core 37 . These programs are part of the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Specialized Program Of Research Excellence (S.P.O.R.E.). All tissue samples were collected with informed consent under an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol at the University of Michigan. (SPORE in Prostate Cancer (Tissue/Serum/Urine) Bank Institutional Review Board # 1994-0481). RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis-Total RNA was isolated using Trizol and an RNeasy Kit (Invitrogen) with DNase I digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity was verified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and random primers (Invitrogen). Quantitative Real-time PCR-Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed using Power SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Real-Time PCR System. All oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and are listed in Supplementary Table 7 . The housekeeping genes, GAPDH, HMBS, and ACTB, were used as loading controls. Fold changes were calculated relative to housekeeping genes and normalized to the median value of the benign samples. Reverse-transcription PCR-Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed for primer pairs using Platinum Taq High Fidelity polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were resolved on a 1.0% agarose gel. PCR products were either sequenced directly (if only a single product was observed) or appropriate gel products were extracted using a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into pcr4-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen). PCR products were bidirectionally sequenced at the University of Michigan Sequencing Core using either genespecific primers or M13 forward and reverse primers for cloned PCR products. All oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and are listed in Supplementary Table 7 . RNA-ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-5′ and 3′ RACE was performed using the GeneRacer RLM-RACE kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RACE PCR products were obtained using Platinum Taq High Fidelity polymerase (Invitrogen), the supplied GeneRacer primers, and appropriate genespecific primers indicated in Supplementary Table 7 . RACE-PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gels. Gel products were extracted with a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen), cloned into pcr4-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen), and sequenced bidirectionally using M13 forward and reverse primers at the University of Michigan Sequencing Core. At least three colonies were sequenced for every gel product that was purified. siRNA knockdown studies-Cells were plated in 100mM plates at a desired concentration and transfected with 20uM experimental siRNA oligos or non-targeting controls twice, at 8 hours and 24 hours post-plating. Knockdowns were performed with Oligofectamine in OptiMEM media. Knockdown efficiency was determined by qPCR. siRNA sequences (in sense format) for knockdowns were as follows: Overexpression studies-SChLAP1 full length transcript was amplified from LNCaP cells and cloned into the pLenti6 vector (Invitrogen) along with LacZ controls. Insert sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing at the University of Michigan Sequencing Core. Lentiviruses were generated at the University of Michigan Vector Core. The benign immortalized prostate cell line RWPE was infected with lentiviruses expressing SChLAP1 or LacZ and stable pools and clones were generated by selection with blasticidin (Invitrogen). Similarly, the immortalized cancer cell line 22Rv1 was infected with lentiviruses expressing SChLAP1 or LacZ and stable pools were generated by selection with blasticidin (Invitrogen). SChLAP1 Cell proliferation assays-72 hours post-transfection with siRNA, cells were trypsinized, counted with a Coulter counter, and diluted to 1 million cells/mL. For proliferation assays, 10,000 cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown in regular media. 48 and 96 hours post-plating, cells were harvested by trypsinizing and counted using a Coulter counter. All assays were performed in quadruplicate. Basement Membrane Matrix Invasion Assays-For invasion assays, cells were treated with the indicated siRNAs and 72 hours post-transfection, cells were trypsinized, counted with a Coulter counter, and diluted to 1 million cells/mL. Cells were seeded onto the basement membrane matrix (EC matrix, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) present in the insert of a 24 well culture plate. Fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After 48 hours, the non-invading cells and EC matrix were gently removed with a cotton swab. Invasive cells located on the lower side of the chamber were stained with crystal violet, air-dried and photographed. For colorimetric assays, the inserts were treated with 150 μl of 10% acetic acid and the absorbance measured at 560nm using a spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). shRNA knockdown-The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and 22Rv1 were seeded at 50-60% confluency and allowed to attach over night. Cells were transfected with SChLAP1 or non-targeting shRNA lentiviral constructs as described previously for 48 hours. GFP+ cells were drug-selected using 1 ug/mL puromycin for 72 hours. 48 hours post-selection cells were harvested for protein and RNA using RIPA buffer or trizol, respectively. RNA was processed as described above. Gene expression profiling-Expression profiling was performed using the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Santa Clara, CA), according to previously published protocols 38 . All samples were run in technical triplicates comparing knockdown samples treated with SChLAP1 siRNA compared to treatments with non-targeting control siRNA. Expression data was analyzed using the SAM method as described previously 20 . Murine intracardiac and subcutaneous in vivo models-All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Committee for the Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA). Intracardiac injection model: 5 × 10 5 cells from one of three experimental cell lines (22Rv1 shNT, 22Rv1 shSChLAP1 #1, shSChLAP1 #2, all with luciferase constructs incorporated) were introduced to CB-17 severe combine immunodefiecient mice (CB-17 SCID) at 6 weeks of age. Female mice were used to minimize endogenous androgen production that may stimulate xenografted prostate cells. 15 mice were used per cell line in order to ensure adequate statistical power to distinguish phenotypes between groups. Mice used in these studies were randomized by double-blind injection of cell line samples into mice and were monitored for tumor growth by researchers blinded to the study design. Beginning one week post injection, bioluminescent imaging of mice was performed weekly using a CCD IVIS system with a 50-mm lens (Xenogen Corp.) and the results were analyzed using LivingImage software (Xenogen). When the mice reached determined endpoint, whole body region of interest (ROI) of 1 × 10 10 photons, or became fatally ill, the animal was euthanized and the lung and liver resected. Half of the resected specimen was put in an immunohistochemistry cassette and placed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate (Fisher Scientific) for 24 hours, and then transferred to 70% ethanol until further analysis. The other half of each specimen was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80°C. A specimen was disregarded if the tumor was localized to the heart only. After accounting for these considerations, there were 9 mice analyzed for 22Rv1 shNT cells, 14 mice each analyzed for 22Rv1 shSChLAP1 #1 and #2 cells. Subcutaneous injection model: 1 × 10 6 cells from one of the three previously described experimental cell lines were introduced to mice (CB-17 SCID), ages 5-7 weeks, with a Matrigel scaffold (BD Matrigel Matrix, BD Biosciences) in the posterior dorsal flank region (n = 10 per cell line). Tumors were measured weekly using a digital caliper, and endpoint was determined as a tumor volume of 1000 mm 3 . When endpoint was reached, or the animal became fatally ill, the mouse was euthanized and the primary tumor resected. The resected specimen was divided in half: one half in 10% buffer formalin and the other half snap frozen. For histological analyses, FFPE-fixed mouse livers and lungs were sectioned on a microtome into 5uM sections onto glass slides. Slides were stained with hematoxalyn and eosin using standard methods and analyzed by a board-certified pathologist (LPK). Immunoblot Analysis-Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with HALT protease inhibitor (Fisher). Western blotting analysis was performed with standard protocols using Polyvinylidene Difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and the signals visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system as described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Protein lysates were boiled in sample buffer, and 10 ug protein was loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel and run for separation of proteins. Proteins were transferred onto Polyvinylidene Difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare) and blocked for 90 minutes in blocking buffer (5% milk, 0.1% Tween, Tri-buffered saline (TBS-T)). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4C with primary antibody. Following 3 washes with TBS-T, and one wash with TBS, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the signals visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system as described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Primary antibodies used were: SNF5 (1:1000, Millipore, ABD22, rabbit) SNF5 (1:1000, Abcam, ab58209, mouse) ACTB (1:5000, Sigma, rabbit) AR (1:1000. Millipore, 06-680, rabbit) RNA immunoprecipitation RIP assays were performed using a Millipore EZ-Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation kit (Millipore, #17-701) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RIP-PCR was performed as qPCR, as described above, using total RNA as input controls. 1:150th of RIP RNA product was used per PCR reaction. Antibodies used for RIP were Rabbit polyclonal IgG (Millipore, PP64), SNRNP70 (Millipore, CS203216), SNF5 (Millipore, ABD22), SNF5 (Abcam, ab58209), and AR (Millipore, 06-680, rabbit), using 5 -7 ug of antibody per RIP reaction. All RIP assays were performed in biological duplicate. For UV-crosslinked RIP experiments, cells were subjected to 400J of 254nM UV light twice and then harvested for RIP experiments as above. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-ChIP assays were performed as described previously 11, 12 , using antibodies for SNF5 (Millipore ABD22) and Rabbit IgG (Millipore PP64B). Briefly, approximately 10^6 cells were crosslinked per antibody for 10-15 minutes with 1% formaldehyde and the crosslinking was inactivated by 0.125M glycine for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with cold PBS three times and cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer plus protease inhibitors. Chromatin was sonicated to an average length of 500bp, centrifuged to remove debris, and supernatants containing chromatin fragments were incubated with protein A/G beads to reduce non-specific binding. Then, beads were removed and supernatants were incubated with 6ug of antibody overnight at 4C. Beads were added and incubated with protein-chromatin-antibody complexes for 2 hours at 4C, washed twice with 1× dialysis buffer and four times with IP wash buffer, and eluted in 150 ul IP elution buffer. 1:10 th of the ChIP reaction was taken for protein evaluation for validation of ChIP pull-down. Reverse crosslinking was performed by inclubating the eluted product with 0.3 M NaCl at 65C overnight. ChIP product was cleaned up with the USB PrepEase kit (USB). ChIP experiments were validated for specificity by Western blotting. ChIP-Seq experiments-Paired-end ChIP-Seq libraries were generated following the Illimuna ChIP-Seq protocol with minor modifications. The ChIP DNA was subjected to endrepair and A base addition before ligating with Illumina adaptors. Samples were purified using Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea CA) and PCR-enriched with a combination of specific index primers and PE2.0 primer under the following conditions: 98C (30 sec), 65C (30 sec), and 72C (40 sec with a 4 sec increment per cycle). After 14 cycles of amplification a final extension at 72C for 5 minutes was carried out. The barcoded libraries were size-selected using a 3% NuSieve Agarose gele (Lonza, Allendale, NJ) and subjected to an additional PCR enrichment step. The libraries were analyzed and quantitated using Bio-Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) before subjecting it to pairedend sequencing using the Illumina Hi-Seq platform. CAM assays-CAM assays were performed as previously described 39 . Briefly, fertilized eggs were incubated in a rotary humidified incubator at 38°C for 10 days. CAM was released by applying mild amount of low pressure to the hole over the air sac and cutting a 1 cm 2 window encompassing a second hole near the allantoic vein. Approximately 2 million cells in 50μl of media were implanted in each egg, windows were sealed and the eggs were returned to a stationary incubator. For local invasion and intravasation experiments, the upper and lower CAM were isolated after 72hr. The upper CAM were processed and stained for chicken collagen IV (immunofluorescence) or human cytokeratin (immunohistochemistry) as previously described 39 . For metastasis assay, the embryonic livers were harvested on day 18 of embryonic growth and analyzed for the presence of tumor cells by quantitative human Alu-specific PCR. Genomic DNA from lower CAM and livers were prepared using Puregene DNA purification system (Qiagen) and quantification of human-Alu was performed as described 39 . Fluorogenic TaqMan qPCR probes were generated as described above and used to determine DNA copy number. For xenograft growth assay with RWPE cells, the embryos were sacrificed on day 18 and the extra-embryonic xenograft were excised and weighed. In situ hybridization-ISH assays were performed as a commercial service from Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc. Briefly, cells in the clinical specimens are fixed and permeablized using xylenes, ethanol, and protease to allow for probe access. Slides are boiled in pretreatment buffer for 15 min and rinsed in water. Next, two independent target probes are hybridized to the SChLAP1 RNA at 40C for 2 hours, with this pair of probes creating a binding site of a preamplifier. After this, the preamplifier is hybridized to the target probes at 30C and amplified with 6 cycles of hybridization followed by 2 washes. Cells are counter-stained to visualize signal. Finally, slides are H&E stained, dehydrated with 100% ethanol and xylene, and mounted in a xylene-based mounting media. In vitro translation-Full length SChLAP1, PCAT-1, or GUS positive control were cloned into the PCR2.1 entry vector (Invitrogen). Insert sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing at the University of Michigan Sequencing Core. In vitro translation assays were performed with the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) with 1mM methionine and Transcend Biotin-Lysyl-tRNA (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ChIRP Assay-ChIRP assays were performed as previously described 40 . Briefly, antisense DNA probes targeting the SChLAP1 full-length sequence were designed using the online designer at http://www.singlemoleculefish.com. Fifteen probes spanning the entire transcript and unique to the SChLAP1 sequence were chosen. Additionally, ten probes were designed against TERC RNA as a positive control and twenty-four probes were designed against LacZ RNA as a negative control. All probes were synthesized with 3′ biotinylation (IDT). Sequences of all probes are listed in Supplementary Table 8 . RWPE cells overexpressing SChLAP1 isoform 1 were grown to 80% confluency in 100mm cell culture dishes. Two dishes were used for each probe set. Prior to harvesting, the cells were rinsed with 17times;PBS and crosslinked with 1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Crosslinking was quenched with 0.125M glycine for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed twice with 1×PBS, collected and pelleted at 1500×g for 5 min. Nuclei were isolated using the Pierce NE-PER Nuclear Protein Extraction Kit. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100mg/ml cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and added before use: 1 mM dithithreitol (DTT), phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), protease inhibitor and Superase-In (Invitrogen)). The lysate was placed on ice for 10 min and sonicated using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) at the highest setting with 30 sec on and 45 sec off cycles until lysates were completely solubilized. Cell lysates were diluted in twice the volume of hybridization buffer (500 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 15% formamide, and added before use: DTT, PMSF, protease inhibitor, and Superase-In) and 100pmol/ml probes were added to the diluted lysate. Hybridization was carried out by end-over-end rotation at 37 °C for 4 hours. Magnetic streptavidin C1 beads were prepared by washing three times in cell lysis buffer and then added to each hybridization reaction at 100ul per 100pmol of probes. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with end-over-end rotation. Bead-probe-RNA complexes were captured with magnetic racks (Millipore) and washed five times with 1mL wash buffer (2×SSC, 0.5% SDS, fresh PMSF added). After the last wash, 20% of the sample was used for RNA isolation and 80% of the sample was used for protein isolation. For RNA elution, beads were resuspended in 200μl of RNA proteinase K buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) and 1mg/ml proteinase K (Ambion). The sample was incubated at 50°C for 45 min and then boiled for 10 min. RNA was isolated using 500ul of Trizol reagent using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). RNA was eluted with 10ul H2O and then analyzed by qRT-PCR for the detection of enriched transcripts. For protein elution, beads were resuspended in 3× the original volume of DNase buffer (100 mM NaCl and 0.1% NP-40), and protein was eluted with a cocktail of 100 ug/ml RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 Units/microliter RNase H (Epicenter), and 100 U/ml DNase I (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min. The eluted protein sample was supplemented with NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (Novex) and NuPAGE® Sample Reducing Agent (Novex) to a final concentration of 1× each and then boiled for 10 min before SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis using a SNF5 antibody (Millipore). RNA-Seq Library Preparation-Total RNA was extracted from healthy and cancer cell lines and patient tissues, and the quality of the RNA were assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Transcriptome libraries from the mRNA fractions were generated following the RNA-Seq protocol (Illumina). Each sample was sequenced in a single lane with the Illumina Genome Analyzer II (with a 40-to 80-nt read length) or with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (with a 100-nt read length) according to published protocols 11, 41 . For strand-specific library construction, we employed the dUTP method of second-strand marking as described previously 42 . Statistical analyses for experimental studies-All data are presented as means ± S.E.M. All experimental assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Statistical analyses shown in figures represent Fisher's exact tests or two-tailed t-tests, as indicated. For details regarding the statistical methods employed during microarray, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data analysis, see Bioinformatic analyses. Bioinformatics Analysis Nomination of SChLAP1 as an outlier using RNA-Seq data-We nominated SChLAP1 as a prostate cancer outlier using the methodology detailed in Prensner JR et al., Nature Biotechnology 2011. Briefly, a modified COPA analysis was performed on the 81 tissue samples in the cohort. RPKM expression values were used and shifted by 1.0 in order to avoid division by zero. The COPA analysis had the following steps: 1) gene expression values were median centered, using the median expression value for the gene across the all samples in the cohort. This sets the gene's median to zero. 2) The median absolute deviation (MAD) was calculated for each gene, and then each gene expression value was scaled by its MAD. 3) The 80, 85, 90, 98 percentiles of the transformed expression values were calculated for each gene and the average of those four values was taken. Then, genes were rank ordered according to this "average percentile", which generated a list of outliers genes arranged by importance. 4) Finally, genes showing an outlier profile in the benign samples were discarded. LNCaP ChIP-Seq data-Sequencing data from GSE14097 were downloaded from GEO. Reads from the LNCAP H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 ChIP-Seq samples were mapped to human genome version hg19 using BWA 0.5.9 43 . Peak calling was performed using MACS 44 according to the published protocols 45 . Data was visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser 46 . RWPE ChIP-Seq data-Sequencing data from RWPE SNF5 ChIP-Seq samples were mapped to human genome version hg19 using BWA 0.5.9 43 . Although we performed paired-end sequencing, the ChIP-Seq reads were processed as single-end to adhere to our preexisting analysis protocol. Basic read alignment statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 6A . Peak calling was performed respect to an IgG control using the MACS algorithm 44 . We bypassed the model-building step of MACS (using the '--nomodel' flag) and specified a shift size equal to half the library fragment size determined by the Agilent Bioanalyzer (using the '--shiftsize' option). For each sample we ran the CEAS program and generated genome-wide reports 47 . We retained peaks with an false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5% (peak calling statistics across multiple FDR thresholds are shown in Supplementary Table 6B ). We then aggregated SNF5 peaks from the RWPE-LacZ, RWPE-SChLAP1 Isoform #1, and RWPE-SChLAP1 Isoform #2 samples using the "union" of the genomic peak intervals. We intersected peaks with RefSeq protein-coding genes and found that 1,299 peaks occurred within one kilobase of transcription start sites (TSSs). We counted the number of reads overlapping each of these promoter peaks across each sample using a custom python script and used the DESeq R package version 1.6.1 48 to compute the normalized fold change between RWPE-LacZ and RWPE-SChLAP1 (both isoforms). We observed that 389 of the 1,299 promoter peaks had at least a 2-fold average decrease in SNF5 binding. This set of 389 genes was subsequently used as a gene set for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Supplementary Table 6C ). Microarray Gene Expression Analysis Microarray experiments-We performed two-color microarray gene expression profiling of 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells treated with two independent siRNAs targeting SChLAP1 as well as control non-targeting siRNAs. These profiling experiments were run in technical triplicate for a total of 12 arrays (6 from 22Rv1 and 6 from LNCaP). Additionally, we profiled 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells treated with independent siRNAs targeting SWI/SNF protein SNF5 (SMARCB1) as well as control non-targeting siRNAs. These profiling experiments were run as biological duplicates for a total of 4 arrays (2 cell lines × 2 independent siRNAs × 1 protein). Finally, we profiled of RWPE cells expressing two different SChLAP1 isoforms as well as the control LacZ gene. These profiling experiments were run in technical duplicate for a total of 4 arrays (2 from RWPE-SChLAP1 isoform #1 and 2 from RWPE-SChLAP1 isoform #2). Processing to determine ranked gene expression lists-All of the microarray data were represented as base-2 log fold-change between targeting versus control siRNAs. We used the CollapseDataset tool provided by the GSEA package to convert from Agilent Probe IDs to gene symbols. Genes measured by multiple probes were consolidated using the median of probes. We then ran one-class SAM analysis from the Multi-Experiment Viewer application and ranked all genes by the difference between observed versus expected statistics. These ranked gene lists was imported to GSEA version 2.07. SChLAP1 siRNA knockdown microarrays-For the 22Rv1 and LNCaP SChLAP1 knockdown experiments we ran the GseaPreRanked tool to discover enriched gene sets in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) version 3.0 22 . Lists of positively and negatively enriched concepts were interpreted manually. SNF5 siRNA knockdown microarrays-For each SNF5 protein knockdown we nominated genes that were altered by an average of at least 2-fold. These signatures of putative SNF5 target genes were then used to assess enrichment of SChLAP1-regulated genes using the GseaPreRanked tool. Additionally, we nominated genes that changed by an average 2-fold or greater across SNF5 knockdown experiments and quantified the enrichment for SChLAP1 target genes using GSEA. RWPE SChLAP1 expression microarrays-The RWPE-SChLAP1 versus RWPE- LacZ expression profiles were ranked using SAM analysis as described above. A total of 1,245 genes were significantly over-or under-expressed and are shown in Supplementary Table 6D . A q-value of 0.0 in this SAM analysis signifies that no permutation generated a more significant difference between observed and expected gene expression ratios. The ranked gene expression list was used as input to the GseaPreRanked tool and compared against SNF5 ChIP-Seq promoter peaks that decreased by >2-fold in RWPE-SChLAP1 cells. Of the 389 genes in the ChIP-Seq gene set, 250 were profiled by the Agilent HumanGenome microarray chip and present in the GSEA gene symbol database. An expression profile across these 250 genes is in Supplementary Table 6E . RNA-Seq data-We assembled an RNA-Seq cohort from prostate cancer tissues sequenced at multiple institutions. We included data 12 primary tumors and 5 benign tissues published in GEO as GSE22260 49 , 16 primary tumors and 3 benign tissues released in dbGAP as study phs000310.v1.p1 50 , and 17 benign, 57 primary, 14 metastatic tumors sequenced by our own institution and released as dbGAP study phs000443.v1.p1. Supplementary Table 1A shows sample information, and Supplementary Table 1B shows sequencing library information. RNA-Seq alignment and gene expression quantification-Sequencing data were aligned using Tophat version 1.3.1 51 against the Ensembl GRCh37 human genome build. Known introns (Ensembl release 63) were provided to Tophat. Gene expression across the Ensembl version 63 genes and the SChLAP1 transcript was quantified by HT-Seq version 0.5.3p3 using the script htseq-count (www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/). Reads were counted without respect to strand to avoid bias between unstranded and strand-specific library preparation methods. This bias results from the inability to resolve reads in regions where two genes on opposite strands overlap in the genome. RNA-Seq differential expression analysis-Differential expression analysis was performed using R package DESeq version 1.6.1 48 . Read counts were normalized using the estimateSizeFactors function and variance was modeled by the estimateDispersions function. Differentially expression statistics were computed by the nbinomTest function. We called differentially expressed genes by imposing adjusted p-value cutoffs for cancer versus benign (padj < 0.05), metastasis versus primary (padj < 0.05), and gleason 8+ versus 6 (padj < 0.10). Heatmap visualizations for these analyses are presented as Supplementary Fig. 5 . RNA-Seq correlation analysis-Read count data were normalized using functions from the R package DESeq version 1.6.1. Adjustments for library size were made using the estimateSizeFactors function and variance was modeled using the estimateDispersions function using the parameters "method=blind" and "sharingMode=fit-only". Next, the raw read count data was converted to pseudo-counts using the getVarianceStabilizedData function. Gene expression levels were then mean-centered and standardized using the scale function in R. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between each gene of interest and all other genes. Statistical significance of Pearson correlations was determined by comparison to correlation coefficients achieved by 1,000 random permutations of the expression data. We controlled for multiple hypothesis testing using the qvalue package in R. The 253-gene SChLAP1 correlation signature was determined by imposing a cutoff of q < 0.05. Oncomine Concepts Analysis of SChLAP1 Signature-We separated the 253 genes with expression levels significantly correlated to SChLAP1 into positively and negatively correlated gene lists. We imported these gene lists into Oncomine as custom concepts. We then nominated significantly associated Prostate Cancer concepts with Odds Ratio > 3.0 and p-value < 10 -6 . We exported these results as nodes and edges of a concept association network, and visualized the network using Cytoscape version 2.8.2. The node positions were computed using the Force Directed Layout algorithm in Cytoscape using the odds ratio as the edge weight. Node positions were subtly altered manually to enable better visualization of node labels. Association of Correlation Signatures with Oncomine Concepts-We applied our RNA-Seq correlation analysis procedure on the genes SChLAP1, EZH2, PCA3, AMACR, ACTB. For each gene we created signatures from the top 5 percent of positively and negatively correlated genes (Supplementary Table 3 ). We performed a large meta-analysis of these correlation signatures across Oncomine datasets corresponding to disease outcome ( . We also incorporated our own concept signatures for metastasis, advanced Gleason score, and localized cancer determined from our RNA-Seq data. For each concept we downloaded the gene signatures corresponding to the Top 5 Percent of genes up-and down-regulated. Pairwise signature comparisons were performed using a one-sided Fisher's Exact Test. We controlled for multiple hypothesis testing using the qvalue package in R. We considered concept pairs with q < 0.01 and odds ratio > 2.0 as significant. In cases where a gene signature associates with both the over-and under-expression gene sets from a single concept, only the most significant result (as determined by odds ratio) is shown. Analysis of SChLAP1-SNF5 expression signatures-The siSCHLAP1 and siSNF5 gene signatures were generated from Agilent gene expression microarray datasets. For each cell line we obtained a single vector of per-gene fold changes by averaging technical replicates and then taking the median across biological replicates. We merged the individual cell line results using the median of the changes in 22Rv1 and LNCaP. Venn diagram plots were produced using the BioVenn website (http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/cdd/biovenn/) 52 . We then compared the top 10% up-regulated and down-regulated genes for siSChLAP1 and siSNF5 to gene signatures downloaded from the Taylor Prostate 3 dataset in the Oncomine database. We performed signature comparison using one-sided Fisher's Exact Tests and controlled for multiple testing using the R package "qvalue". Signature comparisons with q < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. We plotted the odds ratios from significant comparison using the "heatmap.2" function in the "gplots" R package. Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis Based on SChLAP1 Gene Signature-We downloaded prostate cancer expression profiling data and clinical annotations from GSE8402 published by Setlur et. al. 17 . We intersected the 253-gene SChLAP1 signature with the genes in this dataset and 80 genes in common. We then assigned SChLAP1 expression scores to each patient sample in the cohort using the un-weighted sum of standardized expression levels across the 80 genes. Given that we observed SChLAP1 expression in approximately 20% of prostate cancer samples, we used the 80 th percentile of SChLAP1 expression scores as the threshold for "high" versus "low" scores. We then performed 10-year survival analysis using the survival package in R and computed statistical significance using the log-rank test. Additionally, we imported the 253-gene SChLAP1 signature into Oncomine in order to download the expression data for 167 of the 253 genes profiled by the Glinsky prostate dataset 16 . We assigned SChLAP1 expression scores in a similar fashion and designated the top 20% of patients as "high" for SChLAP1. We performed survival analysis using the time to biochemical PSA recurrence and computed statistical significance as above. PhyloCSF Analysis-46-way multi-alignment FASTA files for SChLAP1, HOTAIR, GAPDH, and ACTB were obtained using the "Stitch Gene blocks" tool within the Galaxy bioinformatics framework (usegalaxy.org). We evaluated each gene for its likelihood to represent a protein-coding region using the PhyloCSF software (version released 2012-10-28). Each gene was evaluated using the phylogeny from 29 mammals (available by default within PhyloCSF) in any of the 3 reading frames. Scores are measured in decibans and reflect the likelihood that a predicted protein coding sequence is preferred over its noncoding counterpart. Mayo Clinic Cohort Analyses Study Design-Patients were selected from a cohort of high-risk radical prostatectomy (RP) patients from the Mayo Clinic. The cohort was defined as 1010 high-risk men that underwent RP between 2000 -2006, of which 73 patients developed clinical progression (defined as patients with systemic disease as evidenced by positive bone or CT scan) 53 . High-risk of recurrence was defined as pre-operative PSA >20 ng/ml, pathological Gleason score 8-10, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), or GPSM score >=10 54 . The sub-cohort incorporated all 73 CP progression patients and a 20% random sampling of the entire cohort (202 men including 19 with CP). The total case-cohort study was 256 patients, of which tissue specimens were available for 235 patients. The sub-cohort was previously used to validate a genomic classifier (GC) for predicting Clinical Progression 53 . Tissue Preparation-Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples of human prostate adenocarcinoma prostatectomies were collected from patients with informed consent at the Mayo Clinic according to an institutional review board-approved protocol. Pathological review of H&E tissue sections was used to guide macrodissection of tumour from surrounding stromal tissue from three to four 10 μm sections. The index lesion was considered the dominant lesion by size. RNA Extraction and Microarray Hybridization-For validation cohort, total RNA was extracted and purified using a modified protocol for the commercially available RNeasy FFPE nucleic acid extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). RNA concentrations were calculated using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Rockland, DE). Purified total RNA was subjected to whole-transcriptome amplification using the WT-Ovation FFPE system according to the manufacturer's recommendation with minor modifications (NuGen, San Carlos, CA). For the validation only the Ovation® FFPE WTA System was used. Amplified products were fragmented and labelled using the Encore™ Biotin Module (NuGen, San Carlos, CA) and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Exon (HuEx) 1.0 ST GeneChips following manufacturer's recommendations (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Microarray Expression Analysis- The normalization and summarization of the microarray samples was done with the frozen Robust Multiarray Average (fRMA) algorithm using custom frozen vectors. These custom vectors were created using the vector creation methods as described previously 55 . Quantile normalization and robust weighted average methods were used for normalization and summarization, respectively, as implemented in fRMA. Statistical Analysis-Given the exon/intron structure of isoform 1 of SChLAP1, all probe selection regions (or PSRs) that fall within the genomic span of SChLAP1 were inspected for overlapping with any of the exons of this gene. One PSR, 2518129, was found fully nested within the third exon of SChLAP1 and was used for further analysis as a representative PSR for this gene. The PAM (Partition Around Medoids) unsupervised clustering method was used on the expression values of all clinical samples to define two groups of high and low expression of SChLAP1. Statistical analysis on the association of SChLAP1 with clinical outcomes was done using three endpoints (i) Biochemical Recurrence, defined as two consecutive increases of >=0.2ng/ml after RP, (ii) Clinical Progression, defined as a positive CT or bone scan and (iii) Prostate Cancer Specific Mortality (or PCSM). For CP end point, all patients with CP were included in the survival analysis, whereas the controls in the sub-cohort were weighted in a 5-fold manner in order to be representative of patients from the original cohort. For PCSM end point, patients from the cases who did not die by PCa were omitted, and weighting was applied in a similar manner. For BCR, since the case-cohort was designed based on CP endpoint, resampling of BCR patients and subcohort was done in order to have a representative of the selected BCR patients from the original cohort. siRNA 1: CCAAUGAUGAGGAGCGGGA SChLAP1 siRNA 2: CUGGAGAUGGUGAACCCAA SNF5 siRNA 5: GUGACGAUCUGGAUUUGAA SNF5 siRNA 7: GAUGACGCCUGAGAUGUUU 72 hours post-transfection, cells were trypsinized, counted with a Coulter counter, and diluted to 1 million cells/mL.

Introduction The ability to identify sensory information embedded in a complex environment requires the brain to be able to filter background information and attend to novel stimuli (Linster et al., 2007; Gottfried, 2010) . This is a challenging problem in the olfactory system because odor perception is thought to be related to the combination of activated olfactory receptors, yet different receptors can be activated by the same odor at different concentrations and the same receptor can be activated by perceptually different odors (Duchamp-Viret et al., 1999; Wachowiak and Cohen, 2001; Hu et al., 2020) . A new and potentially important odor stimulus can activate some of the same odor receptors as those activated by a background odor. Thus, distinguishing a novel odor amid a background is inherently confounded at the receptor level. In principle, this confound could be obviated by adaptation, a process in which the input-output transformation of a neuron or brain area is not static, but changes based on repeated presentation of the same odor. Adaptation is essential for filtering out background information (Barlow, 1961; Wark et al., 2007; Weber and Fairhall, 2019) . It is well established that animals exhibit habituation to odor stimuli, a phenomena in which there are reduced behavioral responses to repetitive or constant odor stimulation (Rankin et al., 2009; Pellegrino et al., 2017) . However, the brain areas and neural mechanisms involved in this perception are incompletely understood. Olfactory receptor neurons, which send their projections to the olfactory bulb, adapt in response to some (but not all) stimulus conditions (Kurahashi and Menini, 1997; Leinders-Zufall et al., 1998; Zufall and Leinders-Zufall, 2000; Reisert and Matthews, 2001a; Verhagen et al., 2007; Lecoq et al., 2009; Ghatpande and Reisert, 2011) . Similar observations have been made in the mitral and tufted cells, which receive olfactory receptor neuron input, and project out of the bulb. There are reports of strongly adapting mitral/tufted cells (Margrie et al., 2001; Dietz and Murthy, 2005; McNamara et al., 2008; Chaudhury et al., 2010; Ogg et al., 2015) , while others indicate that they do not adapt and instead strongly adapting neurons are found in their cortical targets (Sobel and Tank, 1993; Wilson, 2000a,b; Cang and Isaacson, 2003; Kadohisa and Wilson, 2006; Shea et al., 2008) . These different experimental outcomes likely reflect differences in preparation type and/or stimulus paradigms as well as the fact that adaptation is mediated by different processes at different timescales (McNamara et al., 2008; Chaudhury et al., 2010; Cafaro, 2016) . Indeed adaptation can occur presynaptically at the olfactory receptor neuron synapse (Murphy et al., 2004; Kazama and Wilson, 2008) . This would presumably result in inherited adaptation in their postsynaptic targets. Adaptation could also occur via circuit mechanisms (Margrie et al., 2001; Dietz and Murthy, 2005) , in which case mitral/tufted cell adaptation could occur in the absence of changes in olfactory receptor neuron input. Thus, although adaptation has been described in mitral/tufted cells, it is impossible to know whether the olfactory bulb was involved or whether the changes are inherited without knowing the olfactory receptor neuron input. Here, we sought to determine whether it is possible to disentangle these issues by simultaneously measuring the input-output transformation of the bulb (Wilson et al., 2004; Storace and Cohen, 2017) . A simultaneous measurement of the input and output makes it certain that the animal condition, odorant delivery, anesthetic level, respiration rate, and other external and internal variables are the same for both measurements. The glomerular input and output odor activation patterns were measured and compared in response to repeated three second odorant presentations separated by six second intervals. In many experiments input and output were measured simultaneously in awake or anesthetized mice using wide-field epifluorescence imaging. In other experiments, input and output were measured in separate, anesthetized preparations using two-photon imaging. The results demonstrate a specific odor presentation paradigm in which the olfactory receptor neurons respond with a relatively stable representation of the sensory environment, while olfactory bulb processing results in output adaptation. Thus, the olfactory bulb may also contribute to sensory adaptation. Materials and Methods Surgery and imaging in adult mice All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, including a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. Thy1-GCaMP6f GP5.11 transgenic mice were acquired from Jax (stock #024339; Dana et al., 2014) . Tbx21-Cre (Jax #024507), and OMP-Cre (Jax #006668; Li et al., 2004 ) transgenic mice were acquired from Jax and crossed to a floxed GCaMP6f reporter transgenic mouse (Jax #024105; Madisen et al., 2015) . OMP-GCaMP3 (Jax #029581) transgenic mice were a gift from Tom Bozza, which were crossed to the Tbx21-Cre line to create a new line in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the olfactory receptor neurons, and cre recombinase was expressed in the mitral/tufted cells (OMP-GCaMP3 x Tbx21-Cre). In this line, the output cells could be targeted with a cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV). Experiments with OMP-GCaMP3 mice were made in animals that were heterozygous. Animals used in the study were confirmed to express the appropriate transgenes via genotyping by Transnetyx. Mice were housed under standard environmental conditions under a 12h light/dark cycle. Our measurements were made during the light phase. For all surgical procedures, male or female adult (40-100 d old) mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (90 mg kg À1 ) and xylazine (10 mg kg À1 ). Anesthesia was supplemented as needed to maintain areflexia, and anesthetic depth was monitored periodically via the pedal reflex. Animal body temperature was maintained at ;37.5°C using a heating pad placed underneath the animal. For recovery manipulations, animals were maintained on the heating pad until awakening. Local anesthetic (1% bupivacaine, McKesson Medical) was applied to all incisions. Respiration was recorded with a piezoelectric sensor. Calcium dye (Cal-590 Dextran, #20509, AAT Bioquest) was loaded into olfactory sensory neurons of mice via the time-honored, yet thorny approach described by Wachowiak and Cohen (2001) . Mice were anesthetized, placed on their back, and an 8-ml mixture of 4%/0.2% calcium dye/Triton X-100 was drawn into a Hamilton syringe with a flexible plastic tip, which was inserted ;10 mm into the nasal cavity; 2 ml of the dye/Triton X-100 mixture was infused into the nose every 3 min. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 4 d before optical measurements. The olfactory sensory neurons were also measured using the genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) GCaMP3 and GCaMP6f (Tian et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013) . The mitral/tufted cells were measured using GCaMP6f, jRGECO1a, and jRCaMP1a (Chen et al., 2013; Dana et al., 2014 Dana et al., , 2016)) . GCaMP6f was endogenously expressed in mitral/tufted cells in Thy1-GCaMP6f 5.11 and Tbx21-Cre x Flex-GCaMP6f transgenic mice. Cre-dependent AAVs were used to express jRGECO1a and in Tbx21-Cre (or OMP-GCaMP3 x Tbx21-Cre) transgenic mice. For epifluorescence imaging, a custom headpost was attached to the top of the posterior skull using metabond (Parkell). The skull above the dorsal olfactory bulb was thinned and covered with an optically transparent glue and allowed to dry. For recordings in awake mice, the skull was covered with Kwik-Sil (WPI), and the mouse was allowed to recover for 3 d. The recording chamber was a conical vial with the sealed end cut open in which the mouse was allowed to acclimate for a minimum of 3 d before imaging experiments. Mice were initially placed in the vial for periods of up to 10 min, which gradually increased up to 30 min. Animals did not exhibit prolonged struggling or other signs of distress. Anesthetized recordings were conducted on the same day as the dissection while being maintained on the heating pad at 37.5°C, and with anesthetic depth being monitored frequently via pedal reflex. Epifluorescence imaging was done using a microscope made from Thorlabs components with two Prizmatix LEDs (UHP-T-LED-455 and UHP-T-LED-545), which were filtered with a 488/10-nm (Semrock FF01-488/10), and a 575/5-nm (Semrock FF01-575/5) excitation filter, respectively. In some preparations the 488/10 filter was substituted with a 470/40-nm, or 461/5-nm filter. A beam combiner dichroic cube directed the light from both LEDs toward a dual-reflectance, dual emission dichroic mirror (59009bs; Chroma) that reflected the excitation light toward the preparation, while transmitting the fluorescence emission of both fluorophores in the emission pathway. The fluorescence emission passed through a 175-mm focal length lens (Edmund Optic), and a dual bandpass filter (Chroma 59009m) before being recorded with a NeuroCCD-SM256 camera with 2 Â 2 (128 Â 128 pixels) or 3 Â 3 (84 Â 84 pixels) binning at frame rates between 25 and 50 Hz using NeuroPlex software (RedShirtImaging). A schematic of the LED strobing is included in Extended Data Figure 1 -1, which was conducted by sending a trigger that defined the onset of each camera frame to an Arduino Mega 2560, which was programmed to send alternating 5 V triggers to the two LED power supplies. The precision of the Arduino board was measured using an oscilloscope (WaveAce 102, Teledyne LeCroy). The delay from detection of a triggered pulse on the camera pin to the output of either of the LED pins was between 4 and 25 ms. The jitter of the output of the LED pin was similarly small. The board was programmed to include a short buffer (500 ms) at the beginning and end of each camera frame during which the LED was off, to avoid cross talk across frames. The strobing control analysis in Extended Data Figure 1 -1 was performed in a transgenic mouse that had GCaMP6f expressed in the olfactory receptor neurons (OMP-Cre x Ai95.flex.GCaMP6f). In this experiment, odor-evoked signals were measured in one trial while the light was on continuously. In another trial, the blue light was strobed so that it was only on during alternate camera frames. The traces in Extended Data Figure 1 -1C are from single trials. Similar results were observed in two additional preparations. The procedures for two-photon imaging experiments were similar to those for epifluorescence. The skull was removed and replaced with agarose and a cover glass window. All imaging took place while the animal was anesthetized on the same day as the surgery. Two-photon imaging was performed with a modified Sutter moveable objective microscope (MOM; Sutter Instruments) equipped with an 8-kHz resonant scanner (Cambridge Technologies). The tissue was illuminated with 940-to 980-nm laser light for GCaMP, or 1040 nm for jRGECO1a using a Coherent Discovery laser (Coherent). Imaging was performed using either a Nikon CFI APO LWD 25 Â 1.10 N.A. a Nikon CFI LWD 16 Â 0.80 N.A., a Leica 20 Â 1.0 NA, an Olympus 10 Â 0.6 NA, a Zeiss 10 Â 0.5 NA, or an Olympus 20 Â 1.0 NA objective. Fluorescence emission passed through a 510/84 bandpass filter and was detected with a GaAsP PMT (Hamamatsu). Power delivered to the sample ranged from 75 to 140 mW as determined using a power meter (Thorlabs PM100D) placed underneath the microscope objective at the beginning of each experiment. Two-photon movies were spatially binned from 512 Â 512 to 256 Â 256 pixels. Data analysis Odorant-evoked signals were collected in consecutive trials separated by a minimum of 3 min. The individual trials were manually inspected, and occasional trials with obvious motion artifacts were discarded. The mice underwent an initial habituation trial on the day before data collection where the mouse was imaged in response to odor stimulation to confirm that the dye loading or AAV injection was successful and to habituate the mouse to the experimental apparatus. On the data collection day, the total number of recording trials (and hence odor presentations) each mouse experienced varied. The data reflect responses to odor stimuli the animals had already been exposed to. Individual glomeruli were visually identified in the average fluorescence intensity, or via a frame subtraction analysis in NeuroPlex that identified activated glomeruli (Wachowiak and Cohen, 2001; Storace and Cohen, 2017) . The frame subtraction analysis color scales (Fig. 1B ) are scaled to the maximum value of the first odor presentation for input and output, respectively. The maps in panel Figure 1B are spatially filtered with one iteration of a 3 Â 3 low-pass filter. Response amplitudes were calculated as the difference between the 2-s average around the peak of the response, and the 2 s preceding the stimulus. Fluorescence signals were converted to DF/F by dividing the spatial average of the pixels containing each identified glomerulus by the resting fluorescence, and were low-pass filtered at 4 Hz. The resting fluorescence was defined as the average of five frames at the beginning of the trial (epifluorescence imaging) or the average of the 3 s before the first odor presentation (two-photon imaging). The scaled subtraction analysis was used to remove common noise and widespread signals (Fig. 1C ,D; Fig. 2 ; Extended Data Figs. 1 2 3 4 , 1-5, 1-6, 3-2). The pixels surrounding an activated glomerulus were selected as the "surround." We made an effort to select nearby pixels that did not overlay other glomeruli appearing in the activity map. The values used in the quantification (Figs. 1D, 2 ) were generated by subtracting the difference between the center and surround values at the peak of the odor response. The example traces shown as "glomerulus minus surround" in Figure 1C , and Extended Data Figs. 1 2 3 4 , 1-5, 1-6, 3-2 were generated using the scaled subtraction function in NeuroPlex. The behavior of the scaled subtraction traces closely reflected that of the activity maps. The responses to the first and third odor response were then normalized to the response amplitude evoked by the first odor presentation. The two-photon data were not analyzed using the scaled subtraction analysis since twophoton imaging is influenced less by out of focus fluorescence. The average fluorescence intensity images in Figure 3A were generated by taking the average of the entire imaging trials. The figures primarily include single trial recordings to highlight the imaging signal-to-noise ratio, although all activity maps (Figs. 1B, 3A), and quantitative measurements (Figs. 1D, 2, 3C,D) were conducted in averaged trials. The population analysis in Figures 2B, 3D averaged all normalized measurements for each preparation. For the two-photon analysis, the normalized response to the second, third and fourth odor presentation were grouped across all preparations for input and output respectively (Fig. 3D ). Two-sample statistical comparisons were performed using a Mann-Whitney U test (ranksum in MATLAB). The bleaching analysis was conducted by measuring the average fluorescence intensity from the spatial average from all the regions of interest used for that preparation at the beginning of the recording trial (i.e., the mean of frames 6-11) and immediately before the third odor pulse (when the odor response to the second stimulus had recovered). The difference between these two values defined the total bleaching within a trial and was used to generate a correction factor for the last odor pulse. The analysis conducted to compare input and output using the same sensor in different preparations used four mice in which GCaMP6f was expressed in the olfactory receptor neurons (a cross between OMP-Cre and a GCaMP6f reporter mouse). The olfactory receptor neuron GCaMP6f dataset includes a total of 417 odor-glomerulus pairs were measured in response to three different odors (methyl valerate, N = 232; isoamyl acetate, N = 124; 2heptanone, N = 61) and concentrations (2% of saturated vapor: N = 263; 0.36%: N = 110; 0.12%: N = 37; 0.06% N = 7). The mean result from each preparation was compared with the preparations in Figure 2 and Table 1 that expressed GCaMP6f in the mitral/tufted cells. The comparison of adaptation measured using different input sensors compared the average adaptation in the four preparations in which GCaMP6f was expressed in the olfactory receptor neurons to the preparations in Figure 2 and Table 1 in which the input was measured using Cal-590 (N = 11 preparations) and GCaMP3 (N = 5 preparations). The statistical comparison between the three groups was conducted using a Kruskal-Wallis test in MATLAB. Odorant stimuli and delivery Odorants (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted from saturated vapor using a flow dilution olfactometer (Vucini c et al., 2006) , a design which generates a constant headspace concentration throughout the trial. Ethyl tiglate, methyl valerate, isoamyl acetate 2-heptanone and an odorant mixture (methyl valerate, isoamyl acetate, and 2-heptanone mixed in equal proportions in liquid phase) were delivered between concentrations of 0.06% and 2% of saturated vapor. The odor stimuli used for the epifluorescence imaging experiments are listed in Table 1 . In a subset of the experiments a photo-ionization detector (200B mini-PID, Aurora Scientific) confirmed the time course and relative concentrations delivered by the olfactometer. The photo-ionization measurements in Extended Data Figure 1 -2 were taken while the sensor was placed in front of the olfactometer located in front of the animal's nose in a subset of the experiments (which is the cause of the "sniff" pattern in the red trace in Extended Data Fig. 1-2A ). We confirmed that the olfactometer delivered repeatable odor pulses by comparing the amplitude of the photoionization detector signal in response to the first and third odor presentation on eight different recording days in response to different odors and concentrations. The amplitude of the third odor pulse changed minimally relative to the first odor pulse (1.3 6 1.7% SEM) when averaging individual trials using different odorants and concentrations. Histology Mice were euthanized with euthasol, and their brains were dissected and left in 4% paraformaldehyde for a minimum of 3 d. Olfactory bulbs were embedded in 3% agarose and cut on a vibratome in 50-to 75-mm-thick coronal sections. Sections were mounted and coverslipped with VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs, H-1500) or Propidium Iodide (Vector Labs, H-1300). Slides were examined using a Zeiss LSM-780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microsystems). Appropriate targeting of the sensors was confirmed by visual inspection. The fluorescence for the images in Figure 1A and Extended Data Figure 1 -3 were generated without additional amplification steps. Images were uniformly contrast-enhanced and sharpened, cropped and pseudo-colored using Zen Lite 2011 (Carl Zeiss Microsystems), Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc.). Results Input-output transformation Simultaneous measurements of input and output Figure 1A shows an example histologic result in which olfactory sensory neurons were loaded with an organic calcium dye (Cal-590 dextran) via nasal infusion (Fig. 1A , left panel; Friedrich and Korsching, 1997; Wachowiak and Cohen, 2001; Fried et al., 2002; Storace and Cohen, 2017) in a transgenic mouse that expressed the GECI GCaMP6f in the mitral/tufted output cells (Fig. 1A , middle panel; Dana et al., 2014) . The merged result (Fig. 1A , right panel) shows that the input and output processes overlap in the bulb glomeruli, and thus, measurements from the glomeruli will have activity signals from both the olfactory receptor neuron input and the mitral/tufted cell output. Alternative imaging frames measured the fluorescence induced by two different excitation wavelengths and thus the two different activity sensors. Input and output activity measurements were made using a microscope with two LED light sources. The LEDs were synchronized with the camera so that only one LED illuminated the preparation in each camera frame (Extended Data Fig. 1 -1A; Miyazaki and Ross, 2015; Miyazaki et al., 2018) . Because the excitation spectra of the fluorophores used in these experiments had minimal overlap, there was minimal cross talk between the fluorophores. Strobing the LEDs did not noticeably impact the imaging signal-to-noise ratio. This can be seen by comparing measurements from trials using continuous illumination to those in which the LED was strobed (in a preparation that had only a single fluorophore, GCaMP6f). Odor-evoked signals were measured during trials in which the blue LED was on continuously, and in separate trials where the blue LED was only on during alternate camera frames (Extended Data Fig. 1-1B , top vs bottom). The signals from the continuous imaging trial were similar to those from the LED-On frames of the strobing trial, while the LED-Off frames had no detectable signal (Extended Data Fig. 1 -1C, black trace). Thus, this approach allows effectively simultaneous measurements of the input-output transformation in a single trial. Simultaneous wide-field input and output measurements from the same glomeruli Odor-evoked responses were measured from the bulb input and output in response to repeated 3-s presentations of the same odor stimulus with a 6-s interstimulus interval in awake or anesthetized head-fixed mice. We confirmed that the olfactometer could deliver stable odor pulses using a photoionization detector (Extended Data Fig. 1 2 ). Figure 1B -D shows measurements from a preparation in which the olfactory receptor neurons were labeled with the organic calcium dye Cal-590 dextran via nasal infusion in the Thy1-GCaMPf 5.11 transgenic line that expresses GCaMP6f in the mitral/tufted cells (Dana et al., 2014; Iwata et al., 2017) . The image of the responses to each odor presentation (methyl valerate at 2% of saturated vapor) was visualized by performing a frame subtraction analysis (see Materials and Methods) for both the input and output (Wachowiak and Cohen, 2001 ; Fig. 1B , activity maps). In this preparation, the input activity map evoked by the third odor presentation was very similar to the activity map evoked by the first odor presentation. This is visualized by scaling the third activity map at the same scale as used for the first presentation (Fig. 1B , top, input, left vs right panel). Thus, the input measurements were stable across odor repeats, exhibiting minimal adaptation. In contrast, the magnitude of the output response changed substantially across odor presentations. Applying the same scaling analysis to the output activity maps revealed reductions in signal amplitude in almost all of the activated glomeruli (Fig. 1B , bottom, output, left vs right panel). Single trial fluorescence time course measurements from two activated glomeruli are shown in Figure 1C . The presence of a glomerular sized peak in the activity map indicates that a glomerulus is more strongly activated than the surround. This is evident by comparing the fluorescence time course measured from a glomerulus versus its surrounding area (Fig. 1C , left panel, color vs black traces). For the input measurements, the separation between the center and surround were similar for the three odor pulses (Fig. 1C , right panel). In contrast, the difference between the center and surround of the output signals became smaller (Fig. 1C , right panel, output). The results from these two glomeruli are consistent with the changes visualized in the input and output activity maps (Fig. 1B ). The difference between the center and surround of activated input and output glomeruli was used to quantify the amount of adaptation. The amplitude of the bulb input declined much less than the output (Fig. 1D ). For this preparation, the input declined to 0.96 6 0.05, while the output declined to 0.68 6 0.07 (p , 0.005; N = 16 glomeruli, output vs input). While the Thy1-GCaMP6f 5.11 transgenic line selectively expresses GCaMP6f in mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, some expression also exists in the cortex (Dana et al., 2014) . We were concerned that some of these cortical neurons could feedback to the olfactory bulb, which could introduce confounding optical signals. We repeated this experiment using the Tbx21-Cre mouse line, which expresses Cre recombinase exclusively in mitral/tufted cells (Mitsui et al., 2011) . This line was then crossed to a transgenic GCaMP6f reporter mouse (Madisen et al., 2015) . Histologic examination confirmed that the GCaMP6f expression was restricted to the mitral/tufted cells (Extended Data Fig. 1-3A ). In these preparations, Cal-590 dextran was loaded into the olfactory receptor neurons using nasal infusion. The results from an example preparation are shown in Extended Data Figure 1 2 3 4 , which has an identical display arrangement as that used in Figure 1B -D. On average the output declined more than the input (input: 0.87 6 0.08; output: 0.49 6 0.1; p = 0.06; N = 4 glomeruli, output vs input). Thus, the differences between input and output are unlikely to be explained by the choice of the transgenic mouse line. Using other combinations of calcium sensors Different optical indicators can vary in their signal-tonoise ratio, and calcium indicators have different affinities (Kd), Hill coefficients, and photobleaching properties (Tian et al., 2009; Akerboom et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013; Badura et al., 2014; Dana et al., 2016) . To control for these effects, we generated a transgenic mouse line in which we could record from the olfactory sensory neuron input using a protein-based sensor (GCaMP3). The Tbx21-Cre transgenic mouse line was crossed to a transgenic mouse in which GCaMP3 (Dewan et al., 2018) was expressed in the bulb input (OMP-GCaMP3 x Tbx21-Cre). The mitral/tufted cell output was targeted with red calcium sensors, either jRCaMP1a or jRGECO1a (Dana et al., 2016) using a Cre-dependent AAV. Histology demonstrating targeting of the sensors in this double transgenic mouse line is shown in Extended Data Figure 1 2 3 . jRCaMP1a was used for the preparation in Extended Data Figure 1 -5 where the input and output declined to 0.97 6 0.06 and 0.85 6 0.07 (N = 23 glomeruli, p = 0.14, output vs input), respectively. jRGECO1a was used for the preparation in Extended Data Figure 1 -6. However, input and output measurements were performed in alternate imaging trials because blue light activates slow and sustained rises in jRGECO1a fluorescence, which precluded simultaneous measurements (Extended Data Fig. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ). Regardless, the results were consistent with the other preparations where the normalized response to the third odor presentation for input and output was 1.0 6 0.04 and 0.92 6 0.1 (N = 7 glomeruli, p = 0.16, output vs input), respectively. Thus, we measured effects in the same direction regardless of whether the input was recorded using an organic dye or a protein-based calcium indicator. Next, we assessed whether output adaptation was dependent on anesthetic state by carrying out input-output measurements in three anesthetized mice (olfactory receptor neurons labeled with Cal-590 in Thy1-GCaMP6f 5.11 mice; Fig. 2 and Table 1 , preparations 14-16). A total of 94 glomeruli-odor pairs (34, 39, and 21 per preparation) were recorded in response to three different odors across four concentrations (between 0.12% and 2% of saturated vapor). Consistent with the prior reports, odors evoked more diffuse output signals in anesthetized mice in comparison to measurements from awake animals (Blauvelt et al., 2013; Wachowiak et al., 2013) . In any case, the output still adapted more on average than the input after applying the center-surround subtraction analysis (input: 0.78 6 0.12; output: 0.64 6 0.13; N = 3 preparations, not statistically significant). Comparisons of input and output A, Signal size measurements from identified glomeruli that were present in both input and output for 16 preparations. Lines show the direction of the same glomeruli for input and output. Preparations 1-13 and 14-16 were conducted in awake and anesthetized mice, respectively. Between 1 and 39 glomeruli were measured in each preparation (15 6 2.6). Input was measured using Cal-590 dextran or GCaMP3 in 11 and 5 preparations, respectively. Output was measured using GCaMP6f, jRGECO1a, or jRCaMP1a in 11, 3, and 2 preparations, respectively. The sensors and odorant for each preparation are given in Table 1 . B, Quantification of signal size across the population of all 16 preparations; *p , 0.05, **p , 0.005. measurements in awake (N = 13 preparations) versus anesthetized (N = 3 preparations) mice were not significant (input: rank-sum = 123; p = 0.11; output: rank-sum = 118, p = 0.36). Thus, the ability of the olfactory bulb to contribute to sensory adaptation does not require wakefulness. We determined whether different bleaching kinetics of the sensors could explain the result by measuring the change in the absolute fluorescence intensity at the beginning of the imaging trial and immediately before the delivery of the third odor pulse. The different sensors had similarly small bleaching effects: Cal-590 (0.98 6 0.01; N = 6), GCaMP3 (0.94 6 0.01; N = 4), GCaMP6f (0.97 6 0.01, N = 6), jRGECO1a (0.96 6 0.01, N = 2), and jRCaMP (0.95, N = 1; values are the fluorescent intensity of the third odor pulse baseline normalized to the first odor pulse baseline). On average the input and output measurements exhibited relatively small and similar decreases (input: 0.96 6 0.01; output: 0.96 6 0.01; N = 10). Thus, bleaching similarly affected both input and output, and by a magnitude much smaller than the effects of adaptation on the output. Summary of same glomeruli input-output comparisons We compared input and output measurements in 16 preparations (13 awake, 3 anesthetized) using 2 different input sensors (Cal-590: 11 preparations; GCaMP3: 5 preparations) and three different output sensors (GcaMP6f: 11 preparations, jRCaMP1a: 2 preparations; jRGECO1a: 3 preparations; Fig. 2A ). The sensors, odorants and odorant concentrations used in these measurements are indicated in Table 1 . Not all glomeruli exhibited the same behavior in each preparation (e.g., the output declined less than the input in some glomeruli), and not all preparations had within comparisons that were statistically significant. However, all but one of the experiments had means in the same direction (Fig. 2A ). The average normalized response to the third odor preparation was averaged across all activated glomeruli per preparation (15 6 2.6; between 1 and 39 glomeruli per preparation). The input and output declined significantly from baseline conditions to 0.88 6 0.03 and 0.71 6 0.04, respectively (input: p , 0.005; output: p , 0.001; Wilcoxon signedrank test). However, the output declined significantly more than the input (p , 0.005; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 2B ). Statistical and experimental details for the individual preparations and the population are included in Table 1 . Thus, the mitral/tufted cells adapt significantly more than olfactory receptor neurons; the olfactory bulb contributes to adaptation. Moreover, preliminary results measuring olfactory receptor neuron activity using the Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicator, ArcLight showed comparable adaptation responses as those measured here using calcium sensors (Platisa et al., 2020) . This strengthens the conclusion that the choice of optical sensor is unlikely to explain the measured differences between input and output. Measuring input and output using the same sensor in different preparations We also controlled for the effects of sensor differences by using the same protein sensor to record from both the input and output, albeit in different preparations. In these experiments, GCaMP6f was used to measure the olfactory bulb input in an OMP-Cre transgenic mouse that had been crossed to a GCaMP6f reporter mouse (Madisen et al., 2015) . We compared these input results to the preparations in Table 1 in which GCaMP6f had been used to measure the mitral/tufted output. The mitral/tufted cell output declined significantly more than the olfactory receptor neuron input when both were measured using GCaMP6f (input: N = 4 preparations, 0.86 6 0.03; output: N = 11 preparations, 0.65 6 0.04; p , 0.01 with Wilcoxon rank-sum test). We also determined whether the magnitude of olfactory receptor neuron adaptation was different when measured using either an organic calcium dye or a protein sensor by comparing input adaptation measured with different sensors. The effect of repeated stimulation on olfactory receptor neurons lead to a similarly modest effect on response amplitude regardless of the sensor (Cal-590: 0.86 6 0.03; GCaMP3: 0.93 6 0.05; GCaMP6f: 0.86 6 0.03; x 2 = 1.7, p = 0.43, Kruskal-Wallis test). Thus, input measurements conducted using an organic calcium dye and two different protein-based GECIs gave similar results. Measuring input and output using two-photon imaging in separate anesthetized preparations The optical signals from wide-field imaging can be influenced by fluorescence originating from above and below the objective focal plane. Accordingly, we made similar measurements using two-photon microscopy, which has a much smaller depth-of-field (Denk et al., 1990) , to test the possibility that our results could be explained by out of focus signals. In these experiments, input and output were measured in different, anesthetized preparations. The input signals were measured in transgenic mice expressing either GCaMP3 (OMP-GCaMP3, N = 5 preparations) or GCaMP6f (OMP-Cre x Flex-GCaMP6f, N = 1 preparation). Output signals were measured in transgenic mice expressing either GCaMP6f (Thy1-GCaMP6f 5.11, N = 5 preparations; Tbx21-Cre x Flex-GCaMP6f, N = 3 preparations) or jRGECO1a (Tbx21-Cre injected with a Credependent jRGECO1a-expressing AAV, N = 1 preparation). Odor responses were measured to different odors (methyl valerate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl tiglate, and 2-heptanone) between 0.4% and 2% of saturated vapor, and the same glomeruli were tested across multiple stimulus conditions when possible. Odor responses were measured in 103 individual input glomeruli (between 7 and 31 glomeruli per preparation), resulting in a total of 202 odorglomerulus input measurements. Odor responses were measured in 269 individual output glomeruli (between 9 and 56 glomeruli per preparation), resulting in a total of 494 odor-glomerulus measurements. The activity maps and fluorescence traces from two different preparations in which only the input or only the output was measured are shown in Figure 3 . The activity maps are scaled in the same manner as those in Figure 1 . Consistent with the wide-field fluorescence imaging experiments, the input measurements were relatively similar across odor repeats, while the output declined (Fig. 3A , see reduced hot colors for most output glomeruli). Fluorescence traces from some of the activated glomeruli are shown to demonstrate the differences (Fig. 3B ). The mean normalized response to the fourth odor presentation for the input preparation was 0.85 6 0.03 (N = 25 odor-glomeruli pairs), while the mean of the output preparation was 0.6 6 0.04 (N = 77 odor-glomeruli pairs; Fig. 3C ). Similar results were obtained across a population of preparations where the mean normalized response to the third odor presentation for the input was 0.83 6 0.11 (N = 6 preparations), while the mean of the output preparations was 0.66 6 0.07 (N = 9 preparations; p , 0.005 using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 3D ). Thus, the two-photon measurements gave results similar to those in wide-field measurements. Overall, measurements from input and output using different combinations of sensors in awake and anesthetized mice, using wide-field and two-photon fluorescence imaging, show that the olfactory bulb contributes to odor adaptation with the odorant presentation protocol we used. The bulb output adapts substantially more than its input. Unusual glomerular response types measured using twophoton and wide-field imaging Input (two-photon). The majority of input glomeruli exhibited increases with different onset kinetics that were consistent with previous reports (Wachowiak and Cohen, 2001; Spors et al., 2006) . Only two glomeruli had suppressed responses (2/103 individual glomeruli; data not shown). Output (two-photon). The majority of output glomerular measurements responded quickly to the odorant and returned to baseline following the removal of the odor (Extended Data Fig. 3-1A , 438/500 glomerular measurements). The remaining measurements (62/500) exhibited more complex response dynamics not seen in the input measurements. Single trial recordings of different response types are included in Extended Data Figure 1 -1B-G. Some glomeruli exhibited both an on and off response (Extended Data Fig. 3-1B,C ; 28/500). Others exhibited a polarity change to repeated odor presentations. These glomeruli typically had a slow increase in fluorescence to the first odor presentation, and suppression to subsequent odor presentations (Extended Data Fig. 3-1D ; 18/ 500). Other response types included an off response (Extended Data Fig. 3-1E ; 2/500), an off-activity increase followed by suppression (Extended Data Fig. 3-1F ; 2/500) and glomeruli whose activity was suppressed by the odor (Extended Data Fig. 3 -1G; 9/500). Note that each trace presented in Extended Data Figure 3 -1B-G was recorded in a trial that had a response in another glomerulus consistent with Extended Data Figure 3 -1A (i.e., a ON response). Many of these response types are consistent with previous reports using electrode measurements and glomerular recordings from mitral/tufted cells (Sirotin et al., 2015; Economo et al., 2016; Bolding and Franks, 2018; Parabucki et al., 2019) . Output (wide-field). In addition, a small fraction of our wide-field epifluorescence mitral/tufted recordings also exhibited unusual response properties (Extended Data Fig. 3-1I-K ). The presence of glomeruli that switch polarities (Extended Data Fig. 3-1D,J ) and those with suppressed responses to all the odor presentations (Extended Data Fig. 3-1K ) suggest that glomerulus specific inhibition occurs. Because none of the input glomeruli had similar characteristics, these effects appear to be generated by processing within the olfactory bulb. In some preparations there were wide-spread areas with suppressed responses (Extended Data Fig. 3-2 ). The suppressed responses often did not change in response to repeated odor presentations, strongly suggesting that broad increases in suppressed signals cannot explain the output adaptation. Discussion Here, we provide the first simultaneous comparison between the olfactory sensory neuron input and the mitral/ tufted cell outputs from many glomeruli in the same preparation in response to repeated odorant presentations. Although prior studies have shown adaptation occurring in both olfactory receptor neurons and mitral/tufted cells (Leinders- Zufall et al., 1998; Reisert and Matthews, 1999, 2001a; Wilson, 2000b; Verhagen et al., 2007; Ghatpande and Reisert, 2011; Ogg et al., 2015) , distinguishing adaptation that occurs as a result of bulb processing from that inherited from the periphery requires recording from both cell populations simultaneously. Measurements from the olfactory receptor neuron input were relatively stable in response to repeated odor presentations, while the mitral/tufted signal declined significantly more. This was true for both wide-field and two-photon measurements. The results demonstrate that the olfactory sensory neurons provide a more faithful representation of the sensory environment, while processing in the olfactory bulb reduces the output signal as a result of repeated presentations. This function is likely to be critical for identifying novel or important odor stimuli from an ongoing odor background. Methodological considerations Near-simultaneous measurements of input and output using strobing LEDs Because adaptation may be experience-dependent, we wanted a way to perform the input and output measurements simultaneously. Multiplexing the LED excitation was preferable to using a dual bandpass filter to simultaneously excite both fluorophores since many fluorophores have broad excitation and emission spectra, which could introduce cross talk between the channels. We concluded that the noise introduced by the strobing approach was negligible. Sensor differences Different optical indicators can vary in their signal-tonoise ratio, and calcium indicators exhibit different calcium affinities (Kd), Hill coefficients and photobleaching properties (Tian et al., 2009; Akerboom et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013; Badura et al., 2014; Dana et al., 2016) . We attempted to address possible effects of the sensors we used by using three strategies. First, we conducted input and output measurements using different combinations of optical sensors with different biophysical properties (Table 1 ). Second, by using the same sensor (GCaMP6f) in different preparations. Third, by demonstrating that the input measurements were similar regardless of the sensor used. Furthermore, olfactory receptor neuron adaptation measured using a voltage indicator gave similar results (Platisa et al., 2020) . Thus, it is unlikely that the reported differences between input and output are artifactual. Furthermore, our recent comparisons of input and output for a different olfactory perception (Storace and Cohen, 2017; Storace et al., 2019) used an even larger number of different calcium and voltage indicators, all of which yielded similar results. That said, one caveat is that these experiments do not address the possibility that the axon terminals and dendrites could have different kinetic properties which could affect our conclusion. The relationship between calcium and neurotransmitter release A concern is that calcium or voltage measurements might not directly reflect synaptic release in the nerve terminals of olfactory receptor neurons, a result described in the Drosophila olfactory system (Kazama and Wilson, 2008; Martelli and Fiala, 2019) . Calcium influx and synaptic vesicle release are significantly correlated when using an odor paradigm with intermittent odor stimulation (Bozza et al., 2004) , although this might not be true under the paradigm we used to induce adaptation. Indeed, in vitro measurements of olfactory receptor neuron synaptic vesicle release exhibited stronger paired-pulse depression than measured using calcium (Wachowiak et al., 2005) . However, other in vitro studies that examined the effects of olfactory nerve layer stimulation on postsynaptic targets reported more rapid recovery (Aroniadou-Anderjaska et al., 2000; Murphy et al., 2004) . Clearly, olfactory receptor neurons exhibit synaptic depression under some conditions, which would be transmitted to the mitral/tufted cells. The relative proportion of mitral/ tufted cell adaptation that can be attributed to depression at the olfactory receptor neuron synapse needs to be addressed in future work using either sensors of synaptic vesicle release (Bozza et al., 2004; Wachowiak et al., 2005) or glutamate targeted to postsynaptic neurons (Marvin et al., 2013 (Marvin et al., , 2018;; Moran et al., 2021) . Another concern is the relationship of calcium measurements in the apical dendrites of mitral/tufted cells to spiking activity in the soma, since synaptic potentials can also evoke increases in calcium (Charpak et al., 2001) . However, these subthreshold signals evoke much smaller increases in calcium than action potentials (Charpak et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2006) . In addition, because action potentials propagate actively over the entire length of the primary dendrite (Debarbieux et al., 2003; Djurisic et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2006) , the calcium signal in the dendritic tufts very likely mainly reflects action potential activity in the mitral/tufted output neurons. Use of a center-surround subtraction to correct for diffuse fluorescence in one-photon experiments Diffuse fluorescence has been described in epifluorescence imaging experiments from both olfactory receptor neuron glomeruli (Wachowiak and Cohen, 2001; Verhagen et al., 2007) and mitral/tufted cell glomeruli (Fletcher et al., 2009; Blauvelt et al., 2013) . Diffuse signal likely reflects some combination of out-of-focus signal and hemodynamics, and these prior studies have used a similar background-subtraction analysis to correct for the diffuse signal. Thus, there is precedent from prior studies to use a similar analysis applied to both olfactory receptor neurons and mitral/tufted cells. Moreover, two results support the validity of this analysis. First, the results of the center-surround analysis were consistent with our frame subtraction analysis. Second, we obtained similar results using two-photon imaging, which greatly increased the zaxis resolution and thus restricted the measurement to the glomerular layer. Thus, we conclude that the centersurround analysis is a reasonable method for correcting diffuse fluorescence. Comparison with previous reports Odorant receptors are known to exhibit adaptation to continuous odor streams or paired pulse stimulation (Kurahashi and Menini, 1997; Reisert and Matthews, 1999, 2001b; Zufall and Leinders-Zufall, 2000; Lecoq et al., 2009; Ghatpande and Reisert, 2011) . However, intact olfactory receptor neurons stimulated with paired pulses of odorants exhibited substantial recovery of the initial response with a 6-s delay between pulses (Kurahashi and Menini, 1997; Zufall and Leinders-Zufall, 2000; Murphy et al., 2004; Wachowiak et al., 2005) . We used an intertrial interval of 6 s, which allowed time for the input signal to partially recover from any adaptation that occurred from the preceding odor pulse. Although our study indicates that mitral/tufted cells adapt to odor stimuli, there are prior reports in which they exhibit relatively sustained responses to a constant or repeated odor stimulus (Sobel and Tank, 1993; Wilson, 1998; Cang and Isaacson, 2003; Kadohisa and Wilson, 2006) . These differences could reflect diversity of mitral/ tufted cell adaptation, as well as the odor stimulation paradigm. Indeed, Figure 2 demonstrates that the average of the mitral/tufted cells in different glomeruli exhibit quite different degrees of adaptation. The glomerular mitral/tufted cell outputs occasionally exhibited activity suppression in response to the initial odor presentation in awake animals (Extended Data Figs. 3-1, 3-2). Suppressed responses were not evident in prior reports of glomerular measurements from mitral/tufted cells in anesthetized mice using wide-field imaging (Fletcher et al., 2009; Ogg et al., 2015; Storace and Cohen, 2017) , although they were reported in anesthetized mice when measured using two-photon imaging (Economo et al., 2016) . Possible mechanisms and future work In earlier experiments, we found that the olfactory bulb transforms an input which is a confound of odorant quality and concentration into an output which is relatively concentration invariant (Storace and Cohen, 2017) . Thus, the olfactory bulb participates in at least two computations simultaneously that may be related to perception. Indeed, despite its position as the first stage of olfactory information processing, the olfactory bulb has also been shown to participate in additional diverse functions including metabolic sensitivity (Fadool et al., 2011; Thiebaud et al., 2014; Riera et al., 2017) , learning (Kass et al., 2013) , and context-dependent processing (Doucette et al., 2011; Nunez-Parra et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017; Koldaeva et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019) . Because the computations that occur in the olfactory bulb about concentration invariance and adaptation occur on a second (or subsecond) time scale, it suggests that the mechanisms are circuit based and do not involve slower processes such as changes in gene expression. However, these computations could presumably involve local circuits as well as processing across multiple brain areas. The role of each of the large number of individual olfactory bulb interneuron types (Parrish-Aungst et al., 2007) need to be examined. Indeed processing within the olfactory bulb network has been shown to be important for both concentration invariance (Banerjee et al., 2015) } as well as for adaptation measured in mitral/tufted cells (Margrie et al., 2001; Dietz and Murthy, 2005) . NMDA receptor modulation has been shown to play a role in olfactory bulb adaptation over much longer timescales (Chaudhury et al., 2010) . Moreover, mitral/tufted cells send axons to twelve brain areas (Davis and Macrides, 1981; Igarashi et al., 2012) , and almost all of those brain areas send feedback projections back to the olfactory bulb (Shipley and Ennis, 1996; Mandairon et al., 2014; In 't Zandt et al., 2019; Schneider et al., 2020) . This centrifugal feedback appears to play a clear role in shaping the long-term olfactory bulb output as evidenced by experiments showing the impact of modulation of the locus coeruleus on adaptation over long timescales (Ogg et al., 2018) , as well as the finding that mitral/tufted cell activity is experience and context dependent (Doucette et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2019) . These data indicate that in the long-term mitral/tufted cell activity is shaped by sensory experience transmitted from higher brain centers, although future experiments are needed to study the role of feedback in the short-term perceptual calculations conducted by the bulb. The results presented here indicate that processing within the bulb can significantly transform a relatively stable olfactory sensory neuron input. In principle, a decreased mitral/tufted output would be useful for higher brain regions to know whether the olfactory input is novel versus part of a stable background. Future studies need to determine how long it takes for the mitral/tufted cells to recover. Is the adaptation odorant specific? Is the degree of adaptation altered by learned associations which are known to influence mitral/tufted cell activity (Wilson and Sullivan, 1992; Doucette et al., 2011; Nunez-Parra et al., 2014; Ross and Fletcher, 2018) ? Our results taken together with other recent work has shown that mitral/tufted cells are influenced by stimulus history (Vinograd et al., 2017; Parabucki et al., 2019) , However, aside from an attenuated response, the functional transformation described here remains unclear. Future studies are needed to define whether this adaptation allows neurons to maximize their dynamic range, a function that exists in other sensory systems (Barlow, 1961; Fairhall et al., 2001; Wark et al., 2007; Whitmire and Stanley, 2016) . In conclusion, it is remarkable that these olfactory perceptual calculations are conducted in the very first processing stage of the mammalian olfactory pathway. In other sensory systems some perceptual responses only appear after processing by multiple brain regions (Van Essen et al., 1992 ; their Fig. 2 ). The finding that the olfactory bulb is carrying out two computations simultaneously has important implications for interpreting the synaptic connectivity in the olfactory bulb. Any given synaptic connection could be part of one, or the other, or both of the perceptual computations. A well-known example of multiple computations in one brain region is V1 in visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020) . But similar results have also been obtained in molluscan (Wu et al., 1994) and annelid (Briggman et al., 2005) nervous systems where individual neurons were shown to participate in more than one behavior. It seems likely that each brain region in all complex nervous systems will be similarly computing more than one output. This might result in the optimal use of a limited number of neurons as well as using an architecture that can more easily coordinate different behaviors. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Introduction A main challenge in systems neuroscience is to understand the patterns of neural activity that support sensory processing 1 , memory 2 , decision making 3 , and cognition 4 . This activity emerges from interactions between neurons 5 , as well as bottom-up sensory and top-down modulatory inputs 6 . Determining how neural circuits give rise to these activity patterns will Modulation of neuronal correlations Simultaneous recordings from large populations of neurons are becoming commonplace in systems neuroscience 14 . Consider two spike trains from the k th trial of such an experiment, and , where the Dirac delta function, , represent the m th spike from neuron i. The spike count correlation coefficient 44, 25 between the two spike trains is: Here is the random spike count computed over a duration T on trial k, and and denote the covariance and variance over trials, respectively. When ρ appears without a subscript, it always refers to output spike correlations. Over small durations (T ~ 1 -10 ms) ρ measures spike train synchrony, while over long durations (T ~ 10 2 -10 3 ms) it captures the shared fluctuations in the firing rates of the two neurons over trials. A growing list of studies show large heterogeneity in correlations measured across the nervous system, as well as from neuron pairs within the same brain region 25, 45, 46, 47 . Nevertheless, the average correlation coefficient across paired spike trains in a cortical population is typically small, ranging from 0.01 to 0.3 depending on the brain region, brain state, and joint stimulus preference of the neuron pair 48, 25, 45 . Here we primarily consider long-timescale correlations, although our general framework is applicable to arbitrary time windows. Neuronal correlations are modulated by a variety of factors including attention and arousal, learning, as well as stimulus onset and type. In this study we will consider correlation changes induced by a broadly defined state change of the nervous system (see Box 1). We present a partial list of examples in Table 1 with each entry describing two states, labeled A and B. For each case we list the relative change of correlation from state A to B, as well as the trial duration T over which ρ is measured. Table 1 shows that ρ can be modulated considerably in different animals, brain regions, cognitive contexts, and when measured over various durations, T. The three final entries in Table 1 highlight correlation modulation determined by intracellular recordings, results that are especially important when establishing physiological mechanisms. In sum, the diversity in the conditions and states in which modulations in correlation have been observed suggests that distinct cellular and circuit mechanisms may be responsible. We next present a unified framework to discuss and compare a number of mechanisms that can impact the correlation coefficient, ρ, as well as how it is modulated across brain states. Central framework for correlation modulation Biological neural circuits consist of neurons belonging to a variety of cell classes wired in complex ways. It is tempting to try to infer the structure of these circuits and the physiological properties of neurons within them from multicellular recordings from subsets of neurons. Such an approach is fraught with difficulties 49 , many of which are due to the fact that only part of the population is observed. Here we describe an alternative strategy that is more modest in scope, but provides a general framework for discussing how modulations in spiking correlations depend on biophysical changes in the underlying circuit to which the neurons belong. To start, we consider a pair of simultaneously recorded neurons (Fig. 1 , black triangles) that are members of a larger, yet unknown, neural circuit (Fig. 1 , colored symbols). To simplify our analysis we assume that neurons in the pair are not directly coupled (although this is not required for our treatment). In this case any correlations between spike trains of the neuron pair are inherited from correlations between their inputs. Under this assumption, we will explore how the cellular properties of the postsynaptic neurons, and those of the presynaptic circuit that drives them, influence correlation transfer. On trial k of the experiment neuron i of our pair (i = 1 or 2) responds to its afferent inputs, , with spikes over the window T. We consider values of T that are much larger than the synaptic and membrane timescale of the neurons, thereby not explicitly measuring the fine temporal structure of the spike trains. For simplicity, we assume that Var(n 1 ) = Var(n 2 ) = Var(n), so that the correlation coefficient between the responses from the neuron pair is . The two neurons do not interact directly, so ρ ≠ 0 implies that the presynaptic inputs to the neurons, x 1 (t) and x 2 (t), are themselves correlated. We quantify this correlation using the input covariance Cov(x̂1, x2), between the integrated synaptic inputs, . When the input covariance, is small we can use the linear approximation: (1) to relate input and output covariance 37 . Here L = L 1 = L 2 is the linear response of the target neuron 50,51 . Briefly, for weak common fluctuations, s(t), we have 〈n i 〉 ≈ 〈n io 〉 + L i ŝ, where 〈•〉 denotes the expectation over trials, 〈n io 〉 is the mean spike count of the of neuron i at its operating point (defined by s = 0), and . The common fluctuations then simply perturb the neuron pair's joint activity about an operational point (where Cov(n 1o , n 2o ) = 0). If the operating point changes (say through a modulation), the linear approximation may change L but Eq. ( 1 ) remains valid. However if perturbations are too large, this linear approximation can break down, although it could still provide qualitative insights. For large time windows, T, the response function L/T is approximately the derivative (slope) of the firing rate -input curve of a neuron at the operational point 37, 38 . We assume that the response of each neuron is the result of a leaky, potentially nonlinear integration of its inputs. The total integrated input, xî(t), includes presynaptic and postsynaptic components. The covariance between presynaptic inputs, Cov(P 1 , P 2 ), is determined by both common projections to the neuron pair, as well as correlations in the activity of the presynaptic pool of neurons 32, 31 . From the vantage point of a postsynaptic neuron pair these sources are indistinguishable. If we neglect synaptic and dendritic nonlinearities then we have that Cov(x̂1, x2) ∞ Cov(P 1 , P 2 ), where the covariance on the right is between the activities, , of the population presynaptic to neuron i on trial k (Fig. 1 ). Postsynaptic effects, such as stochastic vesicle release from synaptic contacts or channel fluctuations, are another well studied source of variability 52, 53 . Since these fluctuations are private to each neuron, we assume that they are uncorrelated between the neuron pair. Further, they are also likely uncorrelated with the activity of the presynaptic population, so that Var(xî) ∞ Var(P i ) + Var(N i ), where N i is the postsynaptic noise (integrated over T) within neuron i (Fig. 1 ). The total correlation coefficient of the inputs is then where R x = Var(N)/Var(P) and ρ P = Cov(P 1 , P 2 )/Var(P). We again assume that the two neurons are statistically identical, so that Var(x) = Var(x̂1) = Var(x̂2), and similarly for the other variances. The coefficient R x then measures the excess fluctuations in the input current due to internal processes in each neuron. Ultimately, we are interested in the variability of the spiking output of a neuron, n i . Unfortunately there is no simple linear relationship between Var(n i ) and Var(x̂i) 54 , as there is for Cov (see Eq. ( 1 )). This makes it difficult to determine the excess variability in the spike response due to internal fluctuations, R y , from only the knowledge of R x . However, we make the reasonable assumption that there is a monotonic relationship between them (i.e when R x increases so too does R y ). In our review we use this observation to simplify our exposition, and hereafter make no distinction between R x and R y . Finally, we consider the network to be in one of two states (labelled A and B) that differ in their spike count pairwise correlation coefficient ρ. This analysis then yields the following expression for the ratio of spike count correlations, ρ A and ρ B in the two states, A and B: (2) The modulation in the output correlation between the two states results from three separate terms: 1. captures state dependent changes in the correlations of the presynaptic input; 2. [(1 + R B )/(1 + R A )] -1 captures state dependent changes in the internal fluctuations within each neuron in the pair; 3. [L B /L A ] 2 captures state dependent changes in the response gain of the transfer from synaptic input to the neurons' output. Generally L A ≠ L B , since the linearization about the operational point at state A will typically differ from that at state B. We next explore each of these modulatory terms in our feedforward network. Three mechanisms of correlation modulation There are several distinct ways to model a state change within the network. For example, neuromodulation through the activation of cholinergic and monoaminergic pathways can have diverse effects on the cellular and synaptic properties in a network 55 . Alternatively, the temporal dynamics of large scale neural activity as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) recordings, show qualitative differences when comparing two distinct neural states 41 . This can be modeled by changing the statistics of the global input to the network 9, 10, 11, 56 . In our framework a presynaptic pool of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (red and blue respectively in Fig. 2 ) project to a representative neuron pair (Fig. 2 , black). We model the shift from state A to state B as an increase in a static external drive to the presynaptic neuron population (Fig. 2 , a1,b1, and c1 vs. a2, b2, and c2). This modeling choice is sufficient to cause changes in both the firing rate and correlations of the postsynaptic pair and can be loosely interpreted as capturing a wide array of neuromodulation schemes. We examine this general model of modulation (see Methods: general feedforward model) in three examples, each highlighting a different mechanism of correlation modulation. Modulating presynaptic correlations We start by analyzing the effect of changes in the correlations in the pool of presynaptic neurons (see Methods: Modulating presynaptic correlations). Here, as in other examples, the target pair of neurons receive correlated excitatory (E) and correlated inhibitory (I) inputs via an overlapping set of projections from the presynaptic pool. In the present case we also include direct connections from excitatory to inhibitory neurons within the presynaptic pool itself. These connections can correlate the inhibitory activity received by one neuron in the pair with the excitatory activity received by the other neuron. The covariance of the total presynaptic activity, over trials is computed as: (3) In state A both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic pools are weakly driven, resulting in low firing rates in the presynaptic populations and subsequently low firing rates of the postsynaptic neuron pair. The low rates in the presynaptic populations allow the spike threshold nonlinearity of the presynaptic cells to suppress neural transfer (the response gain L of the presynaptic populations is small). This compromises the presynaptic inhibitory pool's response to projections from the excitatory presynaptic population. In particular, the low firing rates in the inhibitory pool imply that the excitatory input fluctuations given to the inhibitory pool are poorly transferred by the inhibitory pool to the postsynaptic neuron pair. This results in approximately uncorrelated outputs of the excitatory and inhibitory pool, Cov(Ê i , Î j ) ≈ 0 (Fig. 2 , a3 orange dot). In this case is due primarily to overlapping projections with Cov(Ê 1 , Ê 2 ) > 0 and Cov(Î 1 , Î 2 ) > 0 (Fig. 2 , a3 orange dot). In state B the presynaptic pool of neurons fires at a higher rate, increasing the net input to the postsynaptic pair, yielding a higher postsynaptic firing rate compared to state A (Fig 2, a4 green). Further, since the drive to the inhibitory pool in state B is larger than in state A then the spiking nonlinearity of the inhibitory neurons does not compromise their response to the projections from the excitatory pool. Thus the activity of the presynaptic inhibition is correlated with that of the presynaptic excitation. However, since inhibition is hyperpolarizing while excitation is depolarizing, the projections from the excitatory pool to one postsynaptic neuron are anticorrelated with the inhibitory projections to the other postsynaptic neuron. In the end, Cov(E i , I j ) < 0 (Fig. 2 , a3 blue dot), and this negative covariability cancels the positive covariability due to overlapping projections. This has the effect of reducing overall input correlations, so that (Fig. 2 , a3 blue dot). This leads to a reduction in output correlations (Fig 2, a4 black) with ρ B /ρ A < 1 (via Eq. 2). In this example the linear transfer function remained approximately constant between the two states (L A ≈ L B ) and we did not model private fluctuations (R A = R B = 0). Excitatory and inhibitory currents are widely reported to be strongly correlated with one another 57, 58, 59 . In our model such correlations are due to feedforward excitatory and the associated disynaptic inhibitory pathways from the presynaptic population -a canonical circuit in the brain 60 . The functional consequences of this type of connectivity were first investigated using trial-averaged single neuron activity, with delayed inhibition creating a 'window of opportunity' for neural responses 61, 62, 21, 63 . More recent studies have investigated the influence of this circuit structure on correlations between excitation and inhibition and the covariability of population responses. In the whisker barrel cortex of rodents this circuit structure supports an active decorrelation of the spiking activity between putative excitatory and inhibitory units when measured in the stimulus evoked state, when compared to the spontaneous state 64, 65 . A functionally similar feedforward circuit in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish drives a decorrelated state when stimuli are spatially broad as opposed to spatially compact 66, 67 . The example presented above was based on the models developed in those studies. The cancelation of overall input current covariability by anti-correlated excitatory and inhibitory inputs to neuron pairs was initially studied by Renart, de la Rocha et al. 32 . However, they considered the case of recurrently coupled cortical networks, as opposed to the feedforward structure analyzed above. They showed that in balanced networks of neurons 68 the large sources of correlation due to shared projections within and outside the circuit were robustly and fully cancelled, stabilizing an asynchronous network state. Conditions under which such cancellation occurs have been clarified in further studies of recurrently coupled networks of model spiking neurons 69, 70 . Modulation of correlations is difficult to study in these cases, mainly because correlations are very small (on the order of the inverse of the network size). We will revisit correlation modulation in recurrent networks in a later section. In sum, the circuit mechanisms that determine pre-synaptic covariability are diverse, and a complete treatment is beyond the scope of this review. Nevertheless, in many cases a cancellation between various sources of opposing pre-synaptic correlations is a key component. Modulating postsynaptic noise To demonstrate the influence of private noise on correlation transfer, we consider a model in which synaptic release is random (see Methods: Modulating internal fluctuations). Every presynaptic spike releases a random number of synaptic vesicles to the postsynaptic neuron 53 . This is due to both the nature of vesicle release and the fact that vesicles are replenished at random times. Vesicle recovery dynamics result in activity-dependent changes in the synaptic current's mean and variability. This type of synaptic dynamics is standard in models of short term synaptic depression and has been widely used in past studies 71, 72, 73, 74, 75 . We again consider the response of our model neuron pair in two states. In state A the modulatory drive is weak and presynaptic populations fire at a low rate. In this case, the variability in the postsynaptic current, Var(N), is due primarily to probabilistic vesicle release, since vesicle uptake almost always happens before the next spike arrival. Thus the relative synaptic noise, R A = Var(N A )/Var(P A ), is small (Fig. 2 , b3 blue dot). As a result the output correlation, ρ A , is only weakly diluted by synaptic noise. In contrast, the larger modulatory drive in state B results in higher presynaptic and postsynaptic firing rates (Fig. 2 , b4 green). Higher postsynaptic activity results in increased depression of synaptic transfer due to vesicle depletion. The probabilistic nature of vesicle recovery increases fluctuations in the synaptic current, so that relative synaptic noise, R B , is larger than in state A (Fig. 2 , b3 orange dot). Since vesicle recovery is independent across synapses such increased variability dilutes input correlations, . This results in a modulation of output spiking correlations with ρ B < ρ A (Fig. 2 , b4 black). Variability due to internal release and recovery dynamics within individual synapses is a well documented component of synaptic dynamics 76, 53 . Previous studies focused on the impact of such synaptic variability on the information transmission across a synapse 77, 75 . Here we follow our past study 78 and show how input correlations are diluted by synaptic variability in a firing rate dependent manner (see also 79 ). Synaptic variability is not the only cause of correlation dilution. Alternative mechanisms only need two features: First, the variability must be independent across neurons, so that Cov(x̂1, x2) is unaffected by changes in state, and second, the variability must be activity dependent so that Var(N)/Var(P) changes with the state 80, 81 . A multitude of biophysical mechanisms satisfy these requirements, including fast membrane potential fluctuations due to stochastic openings and closings of ion channels 52, 81 , action potential threshold fluctuations due to finite-sized populations of axonal sodium channels 82 , and slow fluctuations in the cellular excitability of neurons 83 . Modulating neural transfer In the previous example the intensity of background synaptic fluctuations changed the input statistics. We next show how it can also influence output correlations by changing the response gain (L) of a neuron (see Methods: Modulating neural transfer). In our example the drive from the presynaptic populations is balanced, meaning that both excitation and inhibition increase with the modulatory input (Fig. 2, c1 and c2 ). We chose parameters so that the total mean presynaptic input to the target pair is approximately state-independent (through a cancelation of excitation and inhibition currents), but the overall variability of the synaptic input increases with the modulatory drive so that Var(P B ) > Var(P A ). Further, the modulation was such that despite the increase in variance the presynaptic correlations remained fixed, i.e. . Finally, we neglect synaptic variability, so that R A = R B = 0. Thus, any change in output correlation, ρ, cannot be due to a change in input correlation, ρ x . Modeling work 84, 85, 86, 87 , dynamic-clamp slice experiments 88, 89 , and in vivo whole cell recording 90 have all demonstrated that increases in conductance-based input fluctuations lower L. Indeed, in our model since in state B synaptic fluctuations are larger than in state A, it follows that L B < L A (Fig. 2 c3 ). Thus, despite the increase in firing rate between state A and B (Fig. 2 , c4 green), and the absence of changes in the input correlations, , we nevertheless observe ρ B < ρ A (Fig. 2 , c4 black). The reduction of L by increased synaptic activity is well studied 88 , and the subsequent decrease in output correlations under this modulation scheme has been previously noted 89 . Calculating the response gain, L, and determining its impact on the collective behavior of neuronal populations has a long history 91, 50, 51 . In particular, the example of a pair of uncoupled neurons driven by partially correlated inputs has been extensively studied. Formally, the nonlinear transfer between continuous input and spike response ensures that ρ < ρ x 92, 37, 39, 93, 94 , yet the influence of the nonlinearity can be controlled by several factors. In many neuron models L increases with the firing rate of a neuron resulting in a relationship between firing rates and ρ 37, 38, 95 . This prediction has been verified in a variety of experimental studies 25, 96, 10, 95 , and firing rate is often a core determinant of output correlation 45 . However, in general, output spiking correlations and firing rate do not have a prescribed relation, as our examples illustrate (Fig. 2 a4, b4, c4 ). Neural excitability can shape how input correlations are transferred to output correlations, with neural integrators favoring spike count correlations measured over long timescales 93 , while resonator and phasic membrane dynamics show enhanced short timescale synchrony 97, 98, 99, 100 . Subthreshold cellular dynamics, such as spike frequency adaptation 101 or fast membrane tracking of slow synaptic inputs 92 also shape L and hence the transfer of correlation. Increased cellular heterogeneity between the postsynaptic neuron pair typically reduces ρ 38, 102 , particularly when measured over short timescales 38, 103, 104 . These studies all explicitly considered the case of correlation transfer for a neuron pair; however the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that determine the response gain of a neuron have been a long standing topic of interest 105 . Our theory suggests that all of these gain control mechanisms will also influence correlation transfer. Distinguishing between the mechanisms These three examples demonstrate how distinct cellular and circuit mechanisms impact both firing rates and pairwise correlations. We have chosen model parameters so that the changes in firing rate and correlations are nearly identical in all three cases (Fig. 2 , a4,b4, and c4). This illustrates an inherent difficulty in using changes in output statistics to infer the biophysical mechanisms that have caused them. One way to distinguish the mechanisms underlying correlation modulation is to consider spiking correlations ρ as a function of the time window (T) over which they are computed, because different mechanism modulate correlations on different timescales 89, 78, 101 . In general, ρ increases with the time window 106 , as in the case of the feedforward model with non-plastic synapses (Fig. 4a1 and a3 ). However, plastic synapses with short-term depression have long timescale vesicle uptake dynamics (~ 400 ms), attenuating low frequency pre-to post-synaptic transfer. Consequently, broadband presynaptic activity is not correlated with post-synaptic responses over long timescales, and hence ρ is reduced for T > 400ms (Fig. 4a2 ). While measuring ρ as a function of T can help distinguish some mechanisms from others (Fig. 4a1 and a3 vs. a2), it does not provide a perfect diagnostic. Indeed, some qualitatively distinct mechanisms may only show quantitative differences in the timescale dependence of ρ (Fig. 4a1 vs. a3). Another way to distinguish the mechanisms is to recall that ρ is defined as a ratio: In the second equality we used the co-Fano factor 93 , CoF(n 1 , n 2 ) = Cov(n 1 , n 2 )/〈n〉 and the Fano factor, F(n) = Var(n)/〈n〉 (〈n〉 is the mean spike count). A decrease in ρ between state A and B may be due to either 1) a larger decrease in CoF(n 1 , n 2 ) than F(n), or 2) a larger increase in F(n) than CoF(n 1 , n 2 ). The cancelation of presynaptic covariability through feedforward inhibition or the increase in variability through probabilistic vesicle release both lead to a reduction in ρ as in the first case (Fig. 4b1 vs. c1 and b2 vs. c2). In contrast, larger overall variability with increased background fluctuations coupled with a reduced gain leads to a reduction in ρ as in the second case (4b3 vs. c3). However, as with timescales, separating modulations of ρ into modulations of spike count Fano and co-Fano factors can only give partial information about underlying biophysical mechanisms. It is possible to indirectly measure the stimulus-response gain L of a neuron by ranging over a stimulus parameter. If the stimulus dependence and the sources of input variability are known (or can be approximated) then one can account for changes in ρ by changes in L 66 . Manipulations of a neural circuit by pharmacological or optogenetic means can give further insights into how the organization of pre-synaptic correlations, ρ P , or post-synaptic variability, R, contributes to state-dependent changes in ρ (see next section). The most direct method to characterize the mechanisms responsible for state dependent changes in correlation remains to use whole-cell recordings of membrane potential voltage fluctuations. Whole cell recordings give information about both the synaptic inputs and spike outputs, allowing us to measure input correlations, Cov(x 1 , x 2 ), internal fluctuations, R, and response gain, L, directly. In vivo whole cell recording is challenging. However, there are several studies where pairwise correlations have been modulated and simultaneously membrane potentials, or a membrane potential and local field potential have been recorded (see Table 1 ). Studies of this type continue to be well suited to uncover the physiological basis of state-dependent correlation modulation. Correlation modulation in recurrent networks Thus far we explored correlation modulation in a simple feedforward circuit (Figs. 1 and 2 ). However, a primary characteristic of cortical networks is large recurrent projections between neurons. Theoretical neuroscientists have developed and analyzed various models of recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons 107, 108, 109 . These models have provided key insights into the mechanisms that shape spike train correlations. For instance, networks with rapid but delayed recurrent inhibition produce fast timescale correlated activity in the γ frequency range (30-70 Hz) 110, 50, 111 , but often show negligible correlations on slow timescales. Networks with weak or balanced coupling produce slow-timescale correlated activity whose magnitude scales inversely with system size, becoming exceedingly small in networks with thousands of neurons 34, 69, 35, 32, 112 . However, we are far from a complete understanding of self-generated correlated activity in recurrently networks of spiking neurons. Clustered feedforward 113 , clustered recurrent 114, 115, 116 , and spatially distributed network architectures 47, 117, 118 can all produce correlated activity between spiking neurons. In such networks, only neurons that belong to the same cluster or are close to one another are strongly correlated. Indeed, experiments show that noise correlations are large for neuron pairs that are reciprocally connected 119 (same putative cluster), similarly tuned or are nearby in space to one another 48 . However, the mean correlation between neuron pairs that fall outside these categories are also positive on average 48 . Large parallel recordings from neural populations show that spiking correlations have some simple features: network-wide correlations can be largely explained by a one dimensional source of shared fluctuations, often treated as a latent variable in statistical approaches 120, 11, 10, 9, 56 . The origin of this source is not known. A straightforward (albeit phenomenological) way to model these dynamics is to drive a network of spiking neurons with a spatially coherent input that represents an external source of fluctuations 121, 122, 123, 56, 28, 94 . We employ this strategy to study correlation modulation in recurrent networks. We consider a network of model excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spiking neurons with dense, recurrent connections between them (see Methods: Correlation modulation in recurrent networks). Weak feedforward input fluctuations, F(t), are shared by all neurons (providing feedforward covariability Cov F ), alongside private fluctuations specific to each neuron in the network (Fig. 4a ). The shared fluctuations are the largest source of network covariability in the model. In addition, we assume that there is a modulatory input similar to that of our previous models (Fig. 2 ) and simply depolarizes all neurons (different magnitude for E and I neurons). This modulatory input does not affect the external fluctuations F(t). In response to the modulation, E neurons have a higher time-averaged firing rate in state B than state A (Fig. 4b, e ). In both states the shared fluctuations produce significant variability in the population-averaged instantaneous firing rates (Fig. 4b , lower panel). If the strength of shared input fluctuations is small compared to private fluctuations then the linear response framework assumed in Eq. ( 2 ) is valid 121, 122, 124, 112, 66, 28 . In this case the intuition developed from our feedforward analysis will apply to a representative pair of neurons selected from the recurrent network. However, to understand the modulation of neural correlations, ρ, we must understand the combined modulations of the correlations in their presynaptic inputs P, the transfer of presynaptic activity to synaptic current x, and the gain of the postsynaptic response to those currents, L. The nonlinearity of the transfer between synaptic input and spike response allows the gain L to be state-dependent. In our model we have that L A < L B (Fig. 4c ). This differs from our previous analysis (Fig. 2 c3 ) since the network model has current-based synapses, while the feedforward case has conductance-based synapses, mimicking a high conductance state 89 . With current-based synapses and moderate firing rates, an increase in firing rate results in an increase in L, which is supported both by in vitro 37, 105 and in vivo 20 recordings. Thus, in our model it is expected that the modulation will produce L B /L A > 1. Any pair of neurons in our network are correlated through the shared fluctuations F(t) via two pathways: the direct feedforward component that provides input with covariance Cov F between neurons, and the indirect pathway via recurrent excitatory and inhibitory projections between neurons in the network that also receive F(t). To simplify the exposition we consider the joint common recurrent input R(t) = E(t) + I(t). The full covariance of the presynaptic input to a neuron pair then decomposes as: Here Cov R is the covariability due to common recurrent input to the neuron pair, while Cov FR is the interaction between the feedforward and recurrent pathways. This decomposition is similar to feedforward case shown in Eq. ( 3 ). While the feedforward input F(t) is state invariant, the recurrent activity R(t) changes with state. In our model the inhibitory pathway is dominant, making Cov FR < 0 because dynamic recurrent inhibition acts to partially cancel the feedforward drive 121, 69 . The modulatory input enhances this cancellation so that , ultimately yielding Cov A (P 1 , P 2 ) > Cov B (P 1 , P 2 ) (Fig. 4d ). The combined effect of the modulation is then to produce two opposing manipulations of correlation transfer. An increase in response gain (L B /L A > 1) occurs in tandem with a decorrelation of the presynaptic input (Cov(P 1 , P 2 ) B /Cov(P 1 , P 2 ) A < 1). Our theory in Eq. (2) suggest that the response gain modulation will produce an increase in correlation in state B, that is ρ B /ρ A > 1, while the presynaptic correlation modulation lead to decrease, ρ B /ρ A < 1. We chose parameters and a modulation so that the latter effect dominates, and the spike correlation is reduced in state B (Fig. 4e ). In general, modulatory inputs result in state changes in multiple stages of correlation transfer. Nonetheless, the ideas presented in this review can help disentangle the various effects of a network modulation on the spike train correlations of pairs of neurons within the network. As in the feedforward networks, it is difficult to use spike train data alone to dissect the individual contributions of gain and pre-synaptic correlation modulations in a recurrent network. Further probing of the network can, however, give insight into the mechanisms of correlation modulation. To illustrate, we model an experiment where light is used to activate interneurons expressing halorhodopsin in a cortical network (Fig. 4e ). We assume that light hyperpolarizes a fraction (50%) of the I cells in our model. Removing a large fraction of recurrent inhibition changes state dependent modulations in two important ways. First, the increase in firing rates in going from state A to B is much larger (Fig. 4f , green). Second, spike correlations now increase with the state modulation (Fig. 4f, black ). With weaker inhibition the cancellation of feedforward correlations Cov F through Cov FR is attenuated. Thus, when halorhodopsin is activated the decorrelation in neural activity through recurrent inhibition is compromised. Further, the increase in firing rate with decreased inhibition allows L to increase to a larger extent as the network transitions from state A to B. The combination of these effects lead to an increase in ρ with the state change when inhibition is reduced. Had recurrent inhibition not been a primary component of the mechanism underlying the state dependent dependent modulation in the control case, then we would not expect to observe these qualitative changes. This example shows how contemporary circuit manipulation techniques can be used to test concrete predictions about state-dependent correlation changes in recurrent networks. We have confined our analysis to recurrent networks with weak coupling and where neurons receive external sources of fluctuations 121, 122, 66, 34, 69, 35 . In this case linear response techniques are valid. The network simply transforms global input fluctuations into networkwide spiking correlations. However, when coupling is stronger the network can generate globally coherent activity 110, 50, 111 and strong 125 or slow 115, 126 . The complete analysis of such dynamics involves the nonlinear network properties, and hence the factorization in Eq. ( 2 ) is not applicable. Such behavior is beyond the scope of this review. Conclusion We presented a general framework for analyzing the physiological mechanisms underlying the modulations of neuronal correlations. We demonstrated our theory using several examples; however, the list of mechanisms we considered was not exhaustive. The large number of factors that modulate intrinsic cellular properties, as well as synaptic excitation and inhibition, suggest that many distinct mechanisms control neuronal correlation. Our theoretical approach allows for an easier navigation of this large space, and the development of a circuit-based understanding of state-dependent modulation of neuronal activity. Unravelling the mechanics of correlation modulation in vivo will require a concerted experimental effort. We noted that whole-cell recordings will give invaluable data to validate the aspects of certain mechanisms over alternative ones. In addition, the combination of genetic specification 127 and targeted optogentic manipulation of neural circuits 128 promises to provide fundamental insights into neural correlations. Finally, analysis of population-wide recordings describes how pairwise correlations are distributed across large groups of neurons 120, 11, 10, 9, 56 . Extending our theory to networks of neurons is straightforward 121, 122, 34 . However, understanding how the dimensionality of populationwide input correlation is represented by the spike responses of interconnected neurons is an open challenge. The changes in correlated activity we describe may have a number of consequences for neural coding. Theoretical 26, 123 and experimental 96, 129, 130 studies show that changes in correlations can increase the accuracy with which stimulus can be decoded from the population response. Further, increased synchrony has also been shown to precede behaviorally relevant events 131 . However, recent work has exposed that it is the degree of overlap between the structure of population noise correlations and population stimulus tuning that ultimately identifies the correlations that limit information transfer 28 . This implies that conclusions about the effect of noise correlations on neural coding should be made with care. We have come a long way in characterizing the mechanics underlying the responses of single neurons. Understanding circuit and cellular modulations of the collective activity of neural populations will be an essential step toward understanding the brain. Box 1: Neural State The operating state of the brain, or simply state, refers to the context under which neural activity is recorded. This includes several possibilities, such as: The cognitive state is determined by an animal's level of arousal, attentional focus, or degree of engagement in a task. In the absence of a stimulus or task the neural network is in the spontaneous state, as opposed to an evoked state. Stimuli that do not directly drive a neuron, yet recruit a non-classical surround can change the processing state of a neuron. A change in stimulus features within a neuron's receptive field may change its firing rate. However, it does not change the context under which the neural activity is observed, and hence such stimulus features do not determine a state. We consider a pair of unconnected neurons (black triangles) that receive input from a presynaptic population of excitatory neurons (red triangles) and inhibitory neurons (blue circles). Covariability, Cov(P 1 , P 2 ), in the presynaptic inputs, P 1 and P 2 , to the postsynaptic pair is due to a combination of shared anatomical projections leading to a shared input (overlap between P 1 and P 2 ) and correlations between the activity of the presynaptic populations. This presynaptic activity along with internal synaptic and cellular fluctuations, N i , determine the postsynaptic currents, x i (i = 1, 2) in each of the two postsynaptic cells. Finally, the nonlinear spike generation mechanism translates these postsynaptic currents into the output spike trains, y 1 and y 2 . The presynaptic excitatory (E) population (red) and the inhibitory population (blue) both project to the postsynaptic neuron pair. In state A the presynaptic populations are weakly driven, with a slight asymmetry favoring the E population (a1). In contrast, both presynaptic E and I populations are driven strongly in state B (a2). The increase in presynaptic rate uncovers an anticorrelation between the E and I currents, ultimately decorrelating the overall synaptic inputs to the postsynaptic pair (a3). The result of the modulation from state A to B is to both increase the postsynaptic firing rate (a4, green) and decrease spike count correlation (a4, black). (b) The synapses linking presynaptic activity to postsynaptic current are probabilistic, with activity dependent reliability of vesicle release (we show only the E population for schematic brevity). In state A the presynaptic populations are weakly driven and the number of vesicles released per presynaptic spike, and their reliability, is high (b1). In contrast, in state B the presynaptic population fires at a higher rate, resulting in less reliable synaptic transmission (b2). The decrease in synaptic reliability from state A to B increases the synaptic noise to signal ratio, 1 + R (b3). As in a4, the transition from state A to B has the effect of both increasing the postsynaptic firing rate (b4, green) and decreasing the spike count correlation (b4, black). (c) The presynaptic E and I populations project balanced, conductance based inputs to the postsynaptic pair. In state A the firing rates of the presynaptic populations are low, and the overall synaptic fluctuations are small (c1). In contrast, in state B the presynaptic rates are higher, resulting in larger fluctuations in the input to the postsynaptic pair (c2). The increase in conductance based fluctuations between state A and B reduces the spike response gain (L) (c3). As in a4, the transition from state A to B increases the postsynaptic firing rate (c4, green) and decreases the spike count correlation (c4, black). Examples of state dependent modulation of neural correlation ρ between two states We denote the two states with A and B, and the correlations measured in each state by ρ A and ρ B with ρ A > ρ B unless otherwise noted.

S patial attention leads to enhanced sensory processing and improved behavioral outcomes (e.g., higher hit rates and faster reaction times) 1, 2 . Classic studies of spatial attention assumed that its neural and behavioral effects were continuous during attentional deployment. Recent studies, however, have instead demonstrated that spatial attention is discontinuous, sampling the visual environment in theta-rhythmic cycles (3-8 Hz) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . We recently linked rhythmic sampling to theta oscillations in frontal and parietal cortices 4, 5 . These theta rhythms organize neural activity into alternating attentional states associated with either enhanced or diminished perceptual sensitivity 4 . We have proposed that theta-rhythmic sampling thus reflects alternating periods of either (i) engagement at the presently attended location or (ii) relative disengagement, with periods of disengagement likely associated with an increased probability of attentional shifts 4 . In this way, theta-rhythmic sampling provides spatial attention with critical flexibility, offering windows of opportunity when it is easier to disengage from the presently attended location and move to another location. But how are these functionally defined attentional states coordinated across the large-scale network that directs spatial attention? Research into the neural basis of spatial attention has largely focused on cortical contributions, particularly from frontal and parietal cortices 9, 10 . Microstimulation and inactivation studies have shown that these higher-order cortical regions generate modulatory signals that are fed back to sensory cortex [11] [12] [13] , boosting sensory processing at behaviorally relevant locations 2 . Recent research has challenged this cortico-centric view 14 . Several studies have shown that a subcortical structure, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, regulates cortical activity during spatial attention 15, 16 . For example, pulvino-cortical interactions seem to facilitate communication between visual cortices (i.e., V4 and TEO) by aligning the phase of alpha/low-beta activity (8-15 Hz). The pulvinar is the largest nucleus in the primate thalamus, yet its functional significance has remained largely unknown 17, 18 . Lesion and inactivation studies have indicated that the pulvinar plays a critical role in mediating spatial attention. For example, lesions of the pulvinar can result in symptoms that are similar to hemineglect following lesions of parietal cortex 19, 20 . Behavioral impairments in human patients are particularly strong when distractor stimuli compete for attentional resources 21, 22 . Wilke et al. 23 , who used muscimol to inactivate the pulvinar, reported similar behavioral impairments in monkeys. That is, the animals demonstrated diminished exploration of the contralesional visual hemifield during inactivations, particularly when stimuli appeared in both hemifields. The ventral pulvinar is ideally positioned to regulate interactions across the visual system based on its connectivity with cortex 15, 17 . Whereas ventral regions of the pulvinar are largely interconnected with the visual cortex [24] [25] [26] [27] , dorsal regions are largely interconnected with higher-order cortical regions, including the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) [28] [29] [30] . The dorsal pulvinar is therefore an ideal candidate for influencing cortical interactions in the attention network. Few studies, however, have measured neuronal responses in the dorsal pulvinar during spatial attention 31, 32 , and its functional role in the attention network has not yet been defined. Here, we investigated whether pulvino-cortical interactions coordinate the theta-rhythmic attentional states that seemingly shape spatial attention. We therefore simultaneously recorded single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) from FEF 33 , LIP 34 , and the pulvinar 17 , while monkeys performed a spatial attention task that has previously been shown to promote thetarhythmic sampling 3 . We specifically targeted the mediodorsal pulvinar (mdPul), which receives overlapping projections from frontal and parietal cortices (Fig. 1 ) 28 . The present results show that the source of functional connectivity between mdPul and higher-order cortices-which occurs in the alpha/low-beta band (10-20 Hz)-shifts with attentional state, with (i) mdPul being its source during the theta-dependent state associated with engagement (and enhanced perceptual sensitivity) (ii) and LIP being its source during the theta-dependent state associated with relative disengagement (and diminished perceptual sensitivity). We propose that theta-dependent changes in alpha/low-beta activity reflect a functional re-weighting across hubs of the attention network. This rhythmic re-weighting alternately favors brain regions and pathways that promote either attentional sampling or shifting. Results Procedure. Two male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, 6-9 years old) performed a covert spatial-cueing paradigm based on the Egly-Driver task 4, 35 . A peripheral spatial cue indicated where a subsequent, low-contrast visual target was most likely to occur (78% cue validity; Fig. 2 ). The animals maintained fixation, holding down a lever to begin each trial and releasing the lever to indicate visual-target detection. We specifically focused on neural activity during the time period after the cue-evoked response (i.e., the visual-sensory response) and until target onset, which generally satisfied methodological assumptions of stationarity (see Methods). During this cue-target delay, the animals were deploying spatial attention at the cued location. For betweencondition comparisons, we measured neural activity when receptive/response fields overlapped the cued location relative to when receptive/response fields overlapped the non-cued location positioned on a second object 4, 35 (see ref. 4 for previously reported behavioral evidence of attentional deployment at the cued location). Given that the present study is the first to investigate attentionrelated function in mdPul, we started by characterizing neuronal responses in mdPul and then comparing them with neuronal responses in FEF and LIP. That is, we first investigated whether mdPul is a functional hub of the attention network. Supplementary Table 1 displays the number of neurons in each region of interest (ROI) that demonstrated task-related activity. Neurons in frontal and parietal cortices are typically classified based on their response profiles as visual (i.e., sensory-related responses), movement (i.e., saccade-related responses), and visual-movement (i.e., sensory and saccade-related responses) types (see Methods and ref. 4 ). We recorded from a total of 224 neurons in mdPul, with 52 neurons (23.2%) demonstrating significantly increased spiking activity after presentation of the cue (N = 20 visualsensory neurons), the target (N = 13 movement neurons), or both the cue and the target (N = 19 visual-movement neurons). A small population of neurons demonstrated significantly decreased task-related activity (N = 9). In comparison to mdPul, 98/238 neurons (41.2%) in FEF and 98/259 neurons (37.8%) in LIP had significantly increased task-related activity. Although the overall percentage of task-responsive neurons was higher in both FEF and LIP, the distributions of visual, movement, and visualmovement neurons (among task-responsive neurons) were similar across the three ROIs. Figure 3a shows normalized population spiking, time-locked to the cue, and averaged across all neurons with a significantly increased visual-sensory response (i.e., visual and visualmovement neurons). Figure 3b shows normalized population spiking, time-locked to the target and averaged across all neurons with a significantly increased movement response (i.e., movement and visual-movement neurons). In both cases, the responses of mdPul neurons were more similar to LIP than to FEF. For example, spiking activity during the delay did not differ between mdPul and LIP (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.386), but was significantly higher for FEF neurons (FEF vs. mdPul, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.013; FEF vs. LIP, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.0008). Previous studies on cortical hubs of the attention network have shown that only neurons with visual-sensory responses (i.e., visual and visual-movement neurons)-and not movement neurons-demonstrate significant attention-related spiking during the cue-target delay 36, 37 . Here, we demonstrate that mdPul neurons follow the same pattern, with only visual and visualmovement neurons having significant spiking during the cuetarget delay (Supplementary Figure 1 ). We therefore only used neurons with visual-sensory responses (i.e. visual and visualmovement neurons) to determine whether delay spiking in mdPul was significantly higher when receptive fields overlapped the cued location relative to when receptive fields overlapped the non-cued location. For this comparison (i.e., cued vs. non-cued), we averaged spike rates across a 450-ms window, just prior to target presentation, revealing significantly higher delay spiking when receptive fields overlapped the cued location (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.011). We previously performed the same analysis to demonstrate significantly higher, attention-related delay spiking in FEF and LIP 4 . The present findings therefore demonstrate that mdPul-like FEF and LIP-contributes to the maintenance of spatial attention at the cued location and appears to be an integral part of the attention network. mdPul contributes to theta-rhythmic sampling. Recent evidence has demonstrated that spatial attention samples the visual environment in theta-rhythmic cycles [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . We previously linked this theta-rhythmic sampling to the phase of theta oscillations in FEF and LIP 4 . Theta rhythms organized neural activity in these cortical hubs of the attention network into two alternating attentional states, associated with either (i) better visual-target detection at the cued location (i.e., during the "good" theta phase) or (ii) worse visual-target detection at the cued location (i.e., during the "poor" theta phase). Supplementary Figure 2 shows LFP power in mdPul, from 3 to 60 Hz, demonstrating a clear peak in the theta range (after removing the 1/f component). Having previously confirmed mdPul as a functional hub of the attention network (Fig. 3 ), we next measured whether theta phase in the LFP influenced the likelihood of detecting a low-contrast visual target (see Methods). We found a significant phase-detection relationship (permutation test, p < 0.0009), with a peak at 5 Hz (Fig. 4a ), demonstrating that mdPul-like FEF and LIP-has a role in theta-rhythmic sampling during spatial attention. That is, theta-band activity in mdPul is also associated with alternating periods of either better or worse visual-target detection. Fig. 2 A schematic of the behavioral task. The animals pressed a lever to begin each trial and maintained central fixation. A spatial cue indicated, with 78% cue validity, where the visual-target was most likely to occur. Following a variable cue-target delay, a low-contrast visual target was either presented at the cued location or at a non-cued location. The animals responded by releasing the lever. We also included catch trials to track false alarms In FEF and LIP, we previously observed significant phasedetection relationships not only in the theta band but also at higher frequencies (i.e., in the alpha [9-15 Hz], beta [15-35 Hz], and gamma [>35 Hz] bands), with different frequency bands characterizing the two rhythmically alternating attentional states 4 . For example, the theta-dependent state associated with better visual-target detection was characterized by increases in both (i) FEF-dominated beta activity and (ii) LIP-dominated gamma activity. Beta and gamma activity in FEF and LIP were therefore only predictive of behavioral performance during this "good" theta phase (see ref. 4 , Fig. 3e-f ). In comparison, the thetadependent attentional state associated with worse visual-target detection was characterized by an increase in alpha/low-beta activity in LIP. Alpha/low-beta activity in LIP was therefore only predictive of behavioral performance during the "poor" theta phase (see ref. 4 , Fig. 3f ). Based on these previous findings in FEF and LIP, we next examined whether higher-frequency activity in mdPul was linked to a specific attentional state. We re-calculated phase-detection relationships in mdPul (from 9 to 60 Hz) after first splitting trials into two bins: (i) a bin centered on the "good" theta phase (at 5 Hz) and (ii) a bin centered on the "poor" theta phase. Figure 4b displays the results, showing a significant link between alpha/lowbeta phase (12-16 Hz) and visual-target detection (permutation test, p < 0.001). This phase-detection relationship specifically occurred during the "good" theta phase. Notably, this is opposite to the result that we previously reported in LIP (10-18 Hz; see ref. 4 , Fig. 3f ), where alpha/low-beta phase was only predictive of visual-target detection during the "poor" theta phase. See Supplementary Figure 3 for corresponding evidence of (i) phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta phase and alpha/low-beta power (11-23 Hz) in mdPul and (ii) previously reported evidence of PAC between theta phase and alpha/lowbeta power (9-16 Hz) in LIP 4 . These results demonstrate that increases in alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul and LIP are associated with opposite theta-dependent states, indicating a functional dissociation between these two hubs of the attention network. Alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul is predictive of behavioral performance during periods of engagement at an attended location, while alpha/low-beta activity in LIP is predictive of behavioral performance during periods of disengagement. mdPul regulates low-frequency oscillatory activity in cortex. Previous evidence has shown that the ventral pulvinar regulates alpha/low-beta activity in interconnected regions of visual cortex (i.e., V4 and TEO), possibly facilitating the attention-related exchange of information 15 . In the previous section, we demonstrated that alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul was predictive of behavioral performance (Fig. 4 ). Here, we asked whether alpha/ low-beta activity from mdPul plays a role in regulating neural activity in FEF and LIP, thereby extending previous results 14 from lower-order to higher-order cortex. Fig. 3 mdPul contributes to the maintenance of spatial attention at a cued location. a Normalized, cue-locked spike rates, averaged across the population of neurons with significantly increased visual-sensory responses (i.e., visual and visual-movement neurons) when receptive fields overlapped the cued location. b Normalized, target-locked spike rates, averaged across the population of neurons with significantly increased movement responses (i.e., movement and visual-movement neurons) when receptive fields overlapped the cued location. c Normalized spike rates in mdPul, time-locked to either the cue (left) or the target (right), both when receptive fields overlapped the cued location (orange) and when receptive fields overlapped the non-cued location (blue). These plots are averaged across all mdPul neurons with a significantly increased visual-sensory response (i.e., visual and visual-movement neurons). Shaded regions around the lines represent SEs We first examined spike-LFP phase coupling, which measures whether there is a consistent clustering of spikes around oscillatory phases in LFPs. Figure 5a , b demonstrates significant coupling between spikes in mdPul and the phase of alpha/lowbeta activity in both FEF (8-19 Hz) and LIP (15-20 Hz), specifically occurring when both receptive fields and response fields (i.e., the LFP equivalent of the receptive field) overlapped the cued location (permutation test, p < 0.0009). When measuring spike-LFP phase coupling, spikes are typically viewed as reflecting regional outputs, while LFPs are viewed as reflecting a summation of regional inputs 38 . The present results are therefore consistent with mdPul driving alpha/low-beta activity in cortical hubs of the attention network. For mdPul-FEF synchronization, spike-LFP phase coupling was uni-directional, meaning spikes in FEF were not linked to oscillatory phase in mdPul (Fig. 5a ). For mdPul-LIP synchronization, however, spike-LFP phase coupling was bi-directional, with attention-related coupling also occurring between spikes in LIP and the phase of low-frequency oscillatory activity in mdPul (Fig. 5b ; permutation test, p < 0.0009). We later provide evidence that these bi-directional effects (i.e., LIP to mdPul and mdPul to LIP) are temporally dissociable (see Figs. 6 and 7 ). We next examined whether alpha/low-beta activity (i.e., the frequency band most prominently linked to pulvino-cortical interactions) mediates cortico-cortical interactions in the attention network. Figure 5c shows spike-LFP phase coupling between FEF and LIP, combining all cue-responsive neurons (i.e., visual and visual-movement neurons). These results revealed no evidence of coupling between spikes in FEF and alpha/low-beta activity in LIP. In comparison, there was significant coupling between spikes in LIP and low-beta activity in FEF (permutation test, p < 0.0009), but that coupling occurred at a higher frequency than coupling between mdPul and either of the two cortical regions (Fig. 5c ). To further investigate whether alpha/low-beta activity shapes interactions between FEF and LIP, we also used a second, broader measure of spiking activity at the population level. That is, we measured between-region PAC, specifically investigating links between alpha/low-beta phase and high-frequency band activity (HFB; 80-200 Hz). HFB is an established proxy for population spiking 39 . Unlike our analysis of spike-LFP phase coupling (Fig. 5 )-which examined the responses of single neurons identified as having task-related increases in spiking activitythe present analysis (i.e., with HFB) examined summed responses from the entire population of neurons near the recording electrode. Supplementary Figure 4 displays the results, suggesting that cortico-cortical interactions between FEF and LIP indeed occur in windows defined by alpha/low-beta activity (see also ref. 15 ). To evaluate the directionality of functional connectivity in the attention network, we then calculated Granger causality, estimating the influences of alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul on FEF and LIP (relative to the influences of FEF and LIP on mdPul). Granger causal influences were generally stronger from mdPul to both cortical regions than vice versa (Fig. 6a ; permutation test, p < 0.001). There was also an alpha/low-beta Frequencies (in Hz) Alpha/low-beta Fig. 4 The phase of low-frequency oscillatory activity in mdPul is linked to behavioral performance. Hit rates (HRs) were calculated (across recording sessions, N = 95) as a function of oscillatory phase when response fields overlapped the cued location. a Phase-detection functions were then fit with onecycle sine waves (left), with the amplitude of that sine wave representing the strength of the relationship between visual-target detection and oscillatory phase. These phase-detection relationships were calculated at different frequencies, from 3 to 60 Hz (right). Phase-detection relationships at higher frequencies (in FEF and LIP) were previously shown to be dependent on the phase of theta-band rhythms 4 . b Phase-detection relationships in mdPul were therefore re-calculated after first binning trials into two theta-phase bins: (i) one centered on the theta phase associated with better visual-target detection (i.e., the "good" bin) and (ii) one centered on the theta phase associated with worse visual-target detection (i.e., the "poor" bin). The black dots represent statistically significant results after corrections for multiple comparisons peak (at 14 Hz) in Granger causal influence from LIP to FEF. The magnitude of that peak, however, suggests that LIP had a weaker influence on FEF than did mdPul. Supplementary Figure 5 displays conditional Granger causality, which was based on a subset of recording sessions when response fields were aligned across all three ROIs. Conditional Granger causality estimates the influence of one region (X) on another (Y), while accounting for the influence of a third region (Z). The general pattern of results did not change when considering all three ROIs simultaneously rather than in pairs (Fig. 6a ). Granger causal influence therefore corroborates our previous interpretation of spike-LFP phase coupling. That is, mdPul regulates alpha/low-beta activity in cortical hubs of the attention network (Figs. 5 and 6 ; Supplementary Figure 5 ). Pulvino-cortical interactions define functional dissociations. We have thus far shown that theta-band activity in mdPul-like in FEF and LIP 4 -is associated with alternating periods of either enhanced or diminished perceptual sensitivity (i.e., theta-rhythmic sampling), with increased alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul specifically linked to periods of enhanced perceptual sensitivity (Fig. 4 ; Supplementary Figure 3 ). We have also shown that mdPul regulates alpha/low-beta activity in cortical hubs of the attention network (Figs. 5 and 6 ). We next examined whether pulvinocortical interactions differed between (i) the theta-dependent attentional state associated with better visual-target detection (i.e., during the "good" theta phase) or (ii) the theta-dependent state associated with relatively worse visual-target detection (i.e., during the "poor" theta phase). We therefore re-calculated each of our ) Frequency (in Hz) Fig. 5 Spike-LFP phase coupling demonstrates increased functional connectivity between mdPul and cortex during spatial attention. The top panel of each plot shows p-values, indicating whether spike-LFP phase coupling is statistically significant for each condition, cued (orange), or non-cued (blue). The bottom panel compares spike-LFP phase coupling between the two conditions (cued vs. non-cued). Panel a examines spike-LFP phase coupling between mdPul and FEF, panel b examines spike-LFP phase coupling between mdPul and LIP, and c examines spike-LFP phase coupling between FEF and LIP. These plots are based on data from all task-responsive neurons (see Supplementary Table 1 ). Shaded regions around the lines represent SEs between-region measures (i.e., spike-LFP phase coupling and Granger causality) after first binning trials based on theta phase, with one bin centered on the "good" theta phase and the other centered on the "poor" theta phase. The results consistently point to a functional dissociation between mdPul and LIP. Figure 7a shows spike-LFP phase coupling between mdPul and LIP as a function of theta phase (at 5 Hz). Coupling between spikes and alpha/low-beta activity was generally dependent on the theta phase (permutation test, p < 0.001), regardless of directionality (i.e., spikes in mdPul coupled to phase in LIP and vice versa). However, the present results demonstrate that spikes in mdPul were specifically coupled to alpha/low-beta activity (12-18 Hz) in LIP during the "good" theta phase, consistent with mdPul driving alpha/low-beta activity during periods of relatively better visualtarget detection. Supplementary Figure 6 provides evidence that spikes in mdPul were similarly coupled to alpha/low-beta activity in FEF during the "good" theta phase. In comparison, spikes in LIP were coupled to alpha/low-beta activity (14-24 Hz) in mdPul during the "poor" theta phase (Fig. 7a ), suggesting that LIP drives alpha/low-beta activity during periods of relatively worse visualtarget detection. We previously demonstrated coupling between theta phase and alpha-low/beta power in both mdPul and LIP (Supplementary Figure 3 ). Because the reliability of phase estimates improves at higher power, changes in alpha/low-beta power as a function of theta phase (i.e., PAC) could create spurious relationships between spike-LFP phase coupling (in the alpha/low-beta range) and theta phase. We therefore conducted a control analysis, equating both the number of trials and alpha/low-beta power across theta-phase bins (see Methods). This stratification procedure did not change the results (Fig. 7b ), confirming that the apparent directionality of connectivity between mdPul and LIP shifts with theta phase. A similar pattern of results was revealed when we examined Granger causal influence as a function of theta phase (Fig. 6b ). That is, the influence of mdPul on cortical hubs of the attention network was stronger during the "good" theta phase than during the "poor" theta phase. Supplementary Figure 7 shows the same results after stratification by alpha/low-beta power. These data again suggest that mdPul specifically regulates cortical activity during the theta-dependent attentional state associated with better visual-target detection (or enhanced perceptual sensitivity). The functional role of alpha/low-beta activity. We previously demonstrated that the attentional state associated with better  Panel b shows Granger causal influence after binning based on theta phase ("good" vs. "poor"). mdPul specifically regulates cortical activity during periods of relatively better visual-target detection (i.e., during the "good" theta phase). Shaded regions around the lines represent SEs visual-target detection was characterized by an increase in LIPdominated gamma activity 4 . A large body of evidence has linked such increases in cortical gamma to enhanced sensory processing 40 . Here, we investigated whether gamma power in LIP was dependent on the phase of alpha/low-beta activity during either of the theta-dependent attentional states. That is, we examined whether the primary frequency band for pulvino-cortical interactions (i.e., alpha/low-beta) influenced a frequency band previously associated with attention-related effects in LIP (i.e., gamma). Figure 8a , b shows significant PAC between alpha/low-beta phase (at 15-18 Hz) and gamma power in LIP (28-49 Hz), occurring exclusively during periods of disengagement at the cued location (permutation test, p < 0.001). We previously reported that these periods of disengagement (i.e., the "poor" theta phase) were associated with lower overall gamma power in LIP (i.e., relative to periods of engagement at the cued location) 4 . Combined across the two studies, our findings suggest that alpha/low-beta activity disrupts gamma synchronization in LIP during periods of relatively worse visual-target detection (i.e., periods of disengagement), perhaps leading to lower overall gamma power during these periods (see ref. 4 , Fig. 4 ). We also measured significant PAC between alpha/low-beta phase and gamma power when receptive/response fields overlapped the non-cued location (Fig. 8a, b ), occurring regardless of the theta-dependent attentional state (permutation test, p < 0.001). Alpha/low-beta activity in the cortex has been repeatedly linked to the suppression of sensory processing 41 . The present results (at both the cued and the non-cued location) are therefore consistent with a gating by inhibition hypothesis, whereby alpha/ low-beta activity in LIP provides pulsed inhibition of attention-related sensory processing 42 . This local disruption of gamma synchronization in LIP may also extend to between-region interactions. That is, state-specific increases in alpha/low-beta activity in LIP may similarly disrupt previously described gamma synchronization between LIP and FEF 4, 41 , further inhibiting attention-related sensory processing. In comparison, we did not observe significant PAC between alpha/low-beta phase and gamma power in mdPul during either of the theta-dependent attentional states (Fig. 8c, d ). These differences between mdPul and LIP in local PAC-as well as previously described links to opposite theta-dependent attentional states (Figs. 5 and 7 and Supplementary Figure 3 )-suggest that alpha/low-beta activity has different functional roles in mdPul and LIP. Below we further discuss this apparent functional dissociation between mdPul-driven and LIP-driven alpha/lowbeta activity (see the Discussion). Discussion The present results are the first to functionally link mdPul with cortical hubs of the attention network. Locally, we demonstrated significantly increased spiking activity during the cue-target delay in mdPul (i.e., when receptive fields overlapped the cued location), which was similar in magnitude to that observed in LIP (Fig. 3 ). These electrophysiological results thus support previous findings from lesion and inactivation studies [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , indicating that mdPul plays a role in mediating spatial attention at behaviorally relevant locations. We further demonstrated increased coupling between mdPul and both FEF and LIP during spatial attention (Fig. 5 ), indicating that previously described anatomical connectivity between these cortical and subcortical structures [28] [29] [30] b Fig. 7 Spike-LFP phase coupling between mdPul and LIP as a function of theta phase. a Spike-LFP phase coupling (from 9 to 60 Hz) was calculated in overlapping theta-phase bins (on left), using step sizes of 10°. The resulting functions were then fit with one-cycle sine waves. The amplitude of these sine waves provided a measure of how strongly spike-LFP phase coupling was modulated by the phase of theta rhythms (on right, see Fig. 2A for depiction of a similar approach). The black dots represent statistically significant results after corrections for multiple comparisons. b To control for potentially spurious results from theta-dependent changes in alpha/low-beta power (i.e., PAC; see Supplementary Figure 3 ), a stratification procedure was used to equate trials numbers and alpha/low-beta power between two theta-phase bins, centered on either 90°or 270°(outlined in plots on far left). Because this stratification process involves downsampling trials and therefore different results on each run, it was re-run 1500 times. The above plots (b) represent the means and standard deviations (shaded regions around the lines) of those power-equating iterations serves to mediate attention-related processing. The present results thus firmly establish mdPul as a subcortical hub of the attention network. We next consider its functional role in this large-scale network. Spatial attention samples the visual environment in thetarhythmic cycles [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . We previously demonstrated that these theta-rhythmic cycles are seemingly shaped by the phase of theta oscillations in frontal and parietal cortices 4, 5 . Here, we demonstrate that theta activity in mdPul is similarly associated with alternating periods of either enhanced or diminished perceptual sensitivity (Fig. 4 ). That is, theta oscillations organize neural activity in both cortical and subcortical hubs of the attention network into two rhythmically alternating attentional states. We propose that these attentional states alternately promote either (i) engagement at the presently attended location (and therefore enhanced perceptual sensitivity) or (ii) relative disengagement (and therefore diminished perceptual sensitivity), in anticipation of a potential attentional shift. Periods of engagement are associated with increased alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul, while periods of relative disengagement are associated with increased alpha/low-beta activity in LIP (Fig. 4 ; Supplementary Figure 3 ). This state-dependent shifting of alpha/low-beta activity between mdPul and LIP is indicative of a functional dissociation. Although it is broadly assumed that there is functional specialization across hubs of the attention network 43, 44 , electrophysiological evidence has been sparse. Only a few studies have simultaneously recorded from multiple hubs of the attention network. Buschman and Miller 45 , for example, reported that neural activity in FEF first signaled the target location during a serial search task (i.e., a task emphasizing goal-directed attention), while neural activity in LIP first signaled the target location during a pop-out task (i.e., a task emphasizing stimulus-driven attention). Their results thus indicated that FEF and LIP have task-specific functions, with (i) FEF leading LIP during goaldirected attention and (ii) LIP leading FEF during stimulusdriven attention. The present results instead provide evidence of functional specialization during unchanging task demands (i.e., during a task that promotes sustained attention at a cued location). We not only observed a rhythmic re-weighting of alpha/ low-beta power between mdPul and LIP (Supplementary Figure 3 ), but spike-LFP phase coupling and Granger causality also revealed a rhythmic re-weighting of functional connectivity (Figs. 6 and 7 ). That is, the directionality of alpha/low-beta activity shifted between theta-dependent attentional states, with (i) mdPul regulating cortical activity during periods of engagement at the attended location (i.e., during the "good" theta phase) and (ii) LIP regulating thalamic activity during periods of relative disengagement (i.e., during the "poor" theta phase). These proposed functional roles for mdPul (i.e., engagement) and LIP (i.e., disengagement) mirror those first suggested by Posner and Petersen 43 , largely based on data from human lesion studies. Interactions between higher-order cortical regions and mdPul occurred almost exclusively in the alpha/low-beta band, which is typically linked to functional inhibition 41 . Both parietal cortex and the thalamus have been proposed as primary alpha/low-beta generators 15, 46, 47 . A recent study in human epilepsy patients investigated the source of alpha rhythms (7-13 Hz) during quiet wakefulness, recording from both posterior cortex and the pulvinar 46 . Halgren et al. 46 reported that alpha in higher-order cortical regions (i) propagates to visual-sensory cortices and (ii) leads alpha in the pulvinar. Their results thus support a cortical source of alpha rhythms. In comparison, Saalmann et al. 15 reported that alpha (8-15 Hz) in the ventral pulvinar leads alpha in visual-sensory cortices, specifically under conditions of spatial attention. Their results thus support a thalamic source of alpha rhythms. The present findings, on the other hand, indicate that the source of alpha/low-beta activity dynamically shifts between mdPul (i.e., thalamus) and LIP (i.e., cortex). That is, the source of alpha/low-beta rhythms is state-dependent (Figs. 6 and 7 ), potentially explaining the conflicting results of the previously described studies 15, 46 . We next consider whether the function of alpha/low-beta rhythms in the attention network is the same regardless of the source (i.e., mdPul vs. LIP) and the thetadependent attentional state (i.e., engagement vs. disengagement). Electrophysiological studies in both humans and monkeys have repeatedly demonstrated that increased alpha/low-beta activity is a signature of suppressed processing in the sensory cortex 41, 42, 48 . That is, these studies show increased alpha/low-beta power in cortical regions processing task-irrelevant information 41 . For example, Worden et al. 49 , who recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from humans during a spatial-cueing task, reported increased alpha power (8-14 Hz) over occipital cortex contralateral to the to-be-ignored hemifield (i.e., over cortex processing a task-irrelevant location). In agreement with this interpretation, we have proposed that increased alpha/low-beta power in LIP during periods of disengagement (i.e., during the "poor" theta phase) is associated with the suppression of sensory processing 4 . That is, we proposed that periodic increases in alpha power disrupt neural activity associated with processing at the presently attended location (Fig. 8a, b ). This rhythmic reweighting creates windows of opportunity when it is easier for an attentional shift to occur, if warranted by behavioral goals and the visual environment (e.g., stimulus salience). While previous research has generally linked theta rhythms to overt exploration, saccades in primates [50] [51] [52] , and whisking in rodents 53, 54 , future studies will need to establish whether there is specifically an increased likelihood of covert or overt attentional shifts during theta-dependent periods of disengagement (i.e., the "poor" theta phase). The suppressive role of alpha/low-beta activity in sensory cortex is well established, but only a few studies have measured alpha/low-beta activity in the pulvinar 15, 16, 46 . During periods of engagement at the attended location (i.e., during the "good" theta phase), we observed both (i) increased alpha/low-beta power in mdPul and (ii) increased pulvino-cortical influence, also occurring in alpha/low-beta (Figs. 6 and 7 ). Saalmann et al. 15 provided evidence that pulvino-cortical coordination in alpha/low-beta facilitates communication between regions of visual cortex (i.e., V4 and TEO) during spatial attention. Those results similarly demonstrated (i) stronger pulvino-cortical spike-LFP phase coupling and (ii) stronger pulvino-cortical Granger causal influence. Our results therefore indicate that mdPul plays a similar role in the attention network, coordinating alpha/low-beta activity in FEF and LIP (Fig. 5 ; Supplementary Figure 4 ). Notably, this coordination specifically occurs during the attentional state associated with engagement at the attended location (i.e., during the "good" theta phase), when alpha/low-beta power is relatively low in LIP (Supplementary Figure 3 ). It remains unclear whether the increase in alpha/low-beta power in mdPul during periods of engagement is associated with functional inhibition (i.e., the functional role typically attributed to alpha/low-beta in the cortex). For example, this increase in alpha/low-beta power might be associated with a gating of indirect pathways (i.e., cortico-pulvino-cortical), emphasizing direct pathways (i.e., cortico-cortical) during periods of enhanced sensory processing (i.e., during the "good" theta phase). This hypothesis, however, conflicts with observed increases in pulvinocortical influence during periods of engagement (Figs. 6 and 7 ). We therefore propose that alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul is associated with a different function than alpha/low-beta activity in the cortex. As further support for this proposal, Bollimunta et al. 55 previously described two cortical alpha generators, with opposite relationships to behavioral performance. For early visual cortices (i.e., V2 and V4), the primary alpha pacemaker was localized in the infragranular layer, and higher alpha power was associated with worse behavioral performance. For inferior temporal cortex, the primary alpha pacemaker was instead localized in the supragranular layer, and higher alpha power was associated with better behavioral performance. These results thus provide evidence that alpha/low-beta activity can reflect different functions in different brain regions, as here proposed for LIP and mdPul. It should also be noted that cortex and the pulvinar have considerably different anatomical organizations. These differences in anatomical organization may lead to differences in the strength and composition of LFPs, which arise from summed extracellular currents. Whereas cortex has a laminar and columnar organization, the pulvinar does not, instead being characterized by intermixed cell types with heterogeneous inputs, heterogeneous physiological properties, and relatively few local connections 18 . The neural mechanisms and cell types that generate alpha/low-beta activity in LIP and mdPul might therefore also be different. In addition to further investigating the cell types and neural mechanisms underlying alpha/low-beta activity in LIP and mdPul, future studies will need to investigate the specific mechanisms through which increased alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul is associated with both (i) decreased alpha/low-beta activity in LIP and (ii) increased alpha/low-beta synchronization in FEF and LIP. That is, future studies should examine whether increased alpha/low-beta activity in mdPul plays a direct role in reducing alpha/low-beta power in LIP (and vice versa). Zhou et al. 16 , for example, demonstrated that inactivating the ventral pulvinar increased the power of low-frequency oscillations in visual cortical regions, suggesting that normal pulvinar function (i.e., without inactivation) reduces low-frequency power. The pulvinar might therefore facilitate cortico-cortical communication by both synchronizing and reducing cortical alpha/low-beta activity. The present findings demonstrate that theta-rhythmic sampling during spatial attention is characterized by changes in pulvino-cortical interactions. Theta-dependent shifts in alpha/ low-beta activity reflect a functional re-weighting of the attention network, with (i) mdPul dominating alpha/low-beta activity during periods of engagement (and therefore enhanced perceptual sensitivity) and (ii) LIP dominating alpha/low-beta activity during periods of relative disengagement (and therefore diminished perceptual sensitivity). We propose that these statedependent shifts in alpha/low-beta activity alternately favor brain regions and pathways associated with either (i) sampling at the presently attended location or (ii) shifting to another location. Theta rhythms thus seem to coordinate different functions of the attention network by shaping its spatiotemporal structure. Lowfrequency oscillations might play a similar role in other largescale networks, temporally resolving functional conflicts that arise, for example, from competing sensory stimuli 56 or from multiple items being held in working memory 57 . Methods Subjects. The study used two male Macaca fascicularis monkeys (6-9 years old). The Princeton University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures, which conformed to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the humane care and use of laboratory animals. See Supplementary Figure 14 in ref. 4 and Supplementary Figure 8 in the present manuscript for demonstrations of common behavioral and electrophysiological effects between the two animals. Both monkeys demonstrated significantly better visual-target detection at the cued location, significantly increased spiking activity during the cue-target delay, significant theta-band rhythmicity in their behavioral data, and statistically significant PAC. Specific to the present manuscript, both monkeys also demonstrated theta-dependent patterns of functional connectivity (Supplementary Figure 14 ). We combined data from the two animals for all analyses presented in the main text. Behavioral task. The monkeys performed a version of the Egly-Driver task (Fig. 2 ) 35 , which was controlled using Presentation software (Fig. 2 ) (Ottawa Canada). We aborted trials if an animal's eye position deviated by more than one degree. An auditory "go" tone informed the animals when they could hold down a lever to begin a trial. We presented all visual stimuli on a 21-inch CRT monitor with a refresh rate of 100 Hz. Throughout each trial, the animals maintained fixation, focusing on a square at the center of the screen (eye-monitor distance = 57 cm). We monitored eye position using an infrared eye tracker (either an Eyetrac 6 at 240 Hz (Applied Science Laboratories Inc., Bedford MA) or an EyeLink 1000 Plus at 1000 Hz (SR Research Ltd), from central fixation). At the beginning of each trial there was a variable delay of 500-1200 ms. We next presented two-bar-shaped objects (22°× 4.4°), oriented either horizontally or vertically, either above and below central fixation or to the left and right of central fixation. After a second variable delay of 500-1200 ms, we presented a brief spatial cue (100 ms) at the end of one of the bar-shaped objects. This cue indicated the most likely location for a subsequent, low-contrast (2.5-4%) visual target (with 78% cue validity). After a third variable delay (i.e., the cue-target delay) of 300-1600 ms, we presented a brief visual target (100 ms) at the end of one of the bar-shaped objects. The closest side of each bar-shaped object was 6.6°from central fixation and the closest corner of the target (4.4°× 4.4°) was 9.4°from central fixation. If the target did not occur at the cued location, it could occur at one of two non-cued locations (12% of all trials), either at the non-cued location on the same object as the cued location (i.e., the same-object location) or at the non-cued location on the second object (i.e., the different-object location). All of our analyses are focused on either the cued location (i.e., the attended condition) or the different-object location (i.e., our baseline condition). The monkeys released the lever in response to targets, regardless of the target location, receiving a juice reward for responses that occurred 150 to 650 ms after the target (i.e., for correct responses). For 10% of trials, we did not present a visual target. During these "catch trials," the monkeys released the lever when the screen cleared, which occurred 1600 ms after the cue. Electrophysiology. We performed all surgical procedures under general anesthesia with isoflurane (induction 2-5%, maintenance 0.5-2.5%) and under strictly aseptic conditions. We affixed customized plastic recording chambers to the animals using both titanium skull screws and bone cement, with small craniotomies inside those chambers (4.5 mm diameter) providing access to our regions of interest (ROIs). Each craniotomy was fitted with a conical plastic-guide tube filled with bone wax 58 . These wax-filled guide tubes held glass-coated platinum-iridium electrodes (impedance: 5 MΩ) in place between recording sessions. For each animal, we first recorded from the left hemisphere and then moved the chambers to the right hemisphere for further recordings. Each recording session spanned a few hours, with up to seven sessions per week. During each recording session, we used four thin rods that slid into hollows in the side of the implant to stabilize the animal's head. We independently lowered each electrode with microdrives (NAN Instruments Ltd, Nazaret Illit ISR) coupled to an adapter system that allowed different approach angles for each ROI. Electrode signals (40,000 Hz sample rate for spikes; 1000 Hz sample rate for LFPs) were amplified and filtered (150-8000 Hz for spikes; 0.7-300 Hz for LFPs) using a Plexon preamplifier (Plexon Inc., Dallas TX) with a high input impedance headstage and Multichannel Acquisition Processor (MAP) controlled by RASPUTIN software. We sorted spikes online to isolate neurons, and then resorted spikes for offline analyses using Plexon Offline Sorter software. The Egly-Driver task has four target locations, one in each quadrant. To determine where individual neurons and LFPs had their strongest responses, we compared responses to the spatial cue in each quadrant and during a quadrant-mapping task (i.e., large Gabor stimuli flashed in each quadrant). Here, we present data from 95 recording sessions in the mediodorsal pulvinar (mdPul; monkey L, N = 55, monkey R, N = 40). We also simultaneously recorded from FEF and LIP. There were 51 recording sessions when mdPul and FEF had there strongest responses to stimuli in the same visual quadrant, 58 recording sessions when mdPul and LIP had there strongest responses in the same visual quadrant, and 67 recording sessions when FEF and LIP had their strongest responses to stimuli within the same visual quadrant (i.e., aligned RFs and/or multi-unit RFs). We used these recording sessions for between-region analyses. There were 31 recording sessions when all three ROIs had their strongest responses to stimuli within the same visual quadrant. We used these recording sessions to confirm that our between-region analyses of Granger causality were still valid when accounting for the influence of the third region (i.e., conditional Granger causality). Across all recording sessions, we isolated 52 task-responsive neurons in mdPul, 98 in FEF, and 98 in LIP. These neurons had significantly increased spike rates in response to the cue, the target, or both the cue and the target. Acquisition of MR images for electrode positioning. We sedated the animals with ketamine (1-10 mg/kg i.m.) and xylazine (1-2 mg/kg i.m.), and also provided atropine (0.04 mg/kg i.m.). Sedation was maintained with tiletamine/zolazepam (1-5 mg/kg i.m.). We then placed the animals in an MR-compatible stereotaxic frame (1530 M; David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga CA) and monitored vital signs with wireless ECG and respiration sensors (Siemens AG, Berlin DEU) and a fiber optic temperature probe (FOTS100; Biopac Systems Inc, Goleta CA). We maintained body temperature with blankets and a warm water re-circulating pump (TP600; Stryker Corp., Kalamazoo, MI). We collected structural MRI data for the whole brain on a Siemens 3 T MAGNETOM Skyra using a Siemens 11-cm loop coil placed above the head. A high-quality structural image was created for each animal by averaging 6-8 threedimensional (3D) T1-weighted (T1w) volumes acquired in a single scan session (3D Magnetization-Prepared Rapid-Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence, voxel size: 0.5 mm, slice orientation: sagittal, slice thickness: 0.5 mm, field of view (FoV): 128 × 128 mm, FoV phase: 100%, repetition time (TR): 2700 ms, echo time (TE): 2.78 ms, inversion time (TI): 861 ms, base resolution: 256 × 256, acquisition time (TA): 11 min 31 s). T2-weighted (T2w) volumes were acquired with a 3D turbo spin echo with variable flip-angle echo trains (3D T2-SPACE) sequence (voxel size: 0.5 mm, slice orientation: sagittal, slice thickness: 0.5 mm, FoV: 128 × 128 mm, FoV phase: 79.7%, TR: 3390 ms, TE: 386 ms, base resolution: 256 × 256, TA: 17 min 51 s. We used these T2w volumes both to select coordinates for chamber placements and to position electrodes for recordings. Platinum-iridium electrodes create a clearly identifiable, susceptibility-induced signal void along the length of the electrodes in structural MRI images. This "shadow" has a width of approximately one voxel (0.5 mm 3 on either side of the electrode), allowing us to visualize electrode placement (Fig. 1 ). Prior to recordings, we positioned electrodes just dorsal to our ROIs. The electrodes were then held in situ by customized guide tubes and lowered into the cortex over the course of typically 1 week of recordings. We then acquired additional structural MRI data prior to replacing the electrodes. We used the before and after images, as well as daily microdrive measurements, to reconstruct electrode tracks. To further localize electrode penetrations, we aligned the D99 digital template atlas to each individual animal's high-quality T1w MRI volume, using a combination of FSL and AFNI software tools [59] [60] [61] . The D99 atlas is based on and aligned to MRI and histological data from the Saleem and Logothetis 62 atlas, and allows identification of labeled areas within the native 3D MRI volume of an individual animal. Briefly, we first extracted the brains from the T1w MRI volumes using the FSL brain extraction tool (BET) 63 . We then implemented the pipeline provided by Reveley et al. 61 to align the atlas to each monkey's MRI volume. This pipeline included a sequence of affine and nonlinear registration steps to first align the individual animal's MRI volume to the atlas, then inverting the transformations to warp the atlas to the animal's original native space. Once aligned, we overlaid the warped atlas' anatomical subdivisions upon the individual monkey's high-quality T1w MRI volume, co-registered the T2w MRI volumes that contained electrode penetrations, and visualized penetration locations with respect to the warped atlas on the animal's anatomy. For all recordings presented here, the electrodes were positioned in atlas-defined mdPul (labeled as medial pulvinar in the Saleem and Logothetis 62 atlas), FEF, and LIP. Figure 1 shows all of the mdPul penetrations. Fiebelkorn et al. 4 include representative penetrations into FEF and LIP. Spike rate. For all analyses, we used a combination of customized MATLAB (MATLAB R2016a, The Mathworks Inc., Natick MA) functions and the Fieldtrip toolbox (http://www.ru.nl/neuroimaging/fieldtrip) 64 . We measured spike rates by convolving trial-level data with a Gaussian filter (σ = 10 ms) and then averaging across trials. We then used a non-parametric, randomization procedure to determine whether each neuron demonstrated an increased spike rate in response to either the cue or the target (i.e., within 250 ms after cue or target presentation). First, we randomly sampled a response-value from the pre-cue period (-350 to 0 ms) of each trial and averaged those response-values across trials to get a baseline spike rate. We then repeated this procedure 5000 times to generate a reference distribution. To generate a p-value, we determined the proportion of values in the reference distribution that exceeded the observed value from collected data. For all statistical comparisons, unless otherwise specified, we adopted an alpha criterion of 0.05, and used the Holm's sequential Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparisons. For population peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), we grand-averaged spike rates across task-responsive neurons, after first normalizing the spike rate of each neuron based on its maximum response. For between-condition (i.e., cued vs. uncued) statistical comparisons, we first averaged the response across a pre-target window, spanning 500 ms prior to target presentation. We then conducted a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Fig. 1 ). LFP power estimates. To estimate LFP power in mdPul (Supplementary Figure 2 ), we used a fast Fourier transform (FFT) after first applying a Hanning window. Here, we examined power both before and after the cue was presented, restricting our analysis window to the 500 ms prior to either the cue or the target, and only including trials when the bar-cue and cue-target delay was at least 750 ms (i.e., to avoid the cue-evoked sensory response). In order to isolate oscillatory peaks from the 1/f background activity (i.e., to disentangle oscillatory from fractal components), we utilized irregular resampling (IRASA) 65 . IRASA takes advantage of the fact that irregular resampling of the neuronal signal by pairwise non-integer values slightly shifts the peak frequency of oscillatory signals by compressing or stretching the underlying signal. The 1/f component, in comparison, remains constant during resampling. We used the results of IRASA to subtract 1/f estimates (i.e., the fractal component) from the original FFT results, isolating oscillatory residuals (Supplementary Figure 2 ). We then averaged our results across recording sessions. We restricted our analyses to frequencies below 60 Hz, as frequencies above this cut-off have been shown to reflect a broadband, non-oscillatory neural signal 66, 67 . Phase-detection relationships. We investigated whether behavioral performance (i.e., hit rate) was associated with the oscillatory phase in the frequency-specific LFP signal, adapting an approach previously applied to EEG data 68 . We focused on the pre-target signal, convolving complex Morlet wavelets (from 3 to 60 Hz) with the LFP signal just prior to target presentation. We then derived pre-target phase estimates by taking the angle of the complex output. We next sorted trials by phase and calculated HRs within overlapping, 180°p hase bins (e.g., 0-180°). That is, we shifted our phase window in 5°steps (e.g., 5-185°, then 10-190°, etc.) until we generated phase-dependent HRs, spanning all phases for each frequency (Fig. 4a ). This analysis created a function that represented the frequency-specific relationship between oscillatory phase and visual-target detection. We hypothesized a signature shape for this relationship, with a peak in visual-target detection separated from a trough by approximately 180°. Based on this hypothesis, we captured the strength of these phase-detection functions at each frequency by applying FFTs and keeping the second component. The absolute value of this second component represents the amplitude of an oscillation with a single cycle, matching the hypothesized shape (i.e., with a peak in visual-target detection separated from a trough by approximately 180°). For statistical testing, we broke the relationship between phase and behavioral performance by shuffling the observed pre-target phase measurements relative to the observed behavioral outcomes (i.e., hits and misses). We re-shuffled the data 1500 times and repeated the analysis steps (as described above). We then compared the resulting reference distributions at each frequency to the observed phasedetection relationships (accounting for multiple comparisons). The present results revealed a significant relationship between oscillatory phase in the theta band and the likelihood of visual-target detection. We previously reported such a dependency between theta phase in higher-order cortex (i.e., FEF and LIP) and phase-detection relationships at higher frequencies 4 . We therefore next examined whether phase-detection relationships in mdPul follow the same pattern, with phase-detection relationships at higher frequencies similarly being dependent on the phase of theta-band activity (at 5 Hz). We first binned trials into two theta-phase (180°) bins, the first centered on the peak in the previously measured phase-detection function (i.e., the "good" theta phase) and the second centered on the trough (i.e., the "poor" theta phase) in the previously measured phase-detection function (Fig. 4a ). We then re-calculated the phase-detection relationships from 9 to 60 Hz, separately for each theta-phase bin (Fig. 4b ). To determine statistical significance, we used the same approach described above to break the relationship between phase and behavioral performance, but here we did it separately for each of the two theta-phase bins. This statistical analysis therefore determined whether there were significant links between visualtarget detection and oscillatory phase at higher frequencies (from 9 to 60 Hz) within each theta-phase bin. Spike-LFP phase coupling. We measured whether spikes in one brain region clustered at specific phases of the frequency-specific LFP signal (from 3 to 60 Hz) in the other region (e.g., spike times in FEF relative to oscillatory phase in LIP). As a measure of functional connectivity, spike-LFP phase coupling avoids spurious coupling associated with using a common recording reference, which can sometimes make it difficult to interpret LFP-LFP phase coupling. For each spike time within a window from -500 to -125 ms prior to target presentation, we calculated corresponding phase estimates from the LFPs (centered on the spike time). We used the pairwise phase consistency (PPC) to measure spike-LFP phase coupling independent of differences in spike counts or trial numbers 69 . Higher PPC values indicate a greater clustering of spikes at specific phases of frequency-specific oscillatory activity in the LFP signal. For between-region analyses, increased spike-LFP phase coupling (as measured with PPC) is thought to reflect increased network connectivity. Although not a causal measure, spike-LFP phase coupling is also often interpreted with directionality, with spikes being interpreted as an output signal and LFPs being interpreted as an input signal 38 . For statistical testing, we (i) shuffled (1500 times) trials between conditions (cued vs. uncued) and (ii) re-calculated the difference in PPC between the shuffled conditions. We then compared the resulting reference distributions with the observed difference in PPC values. We also measured spike-LFP phase coupling (from 9 to 60 Hz) as a function of theta phase (at 5 Hz). Here, we iteratively calculated spike-LFP phase coupling in overlapping, 180°phase windows (e.g., 0-180°), shifting the phase window in 5°s teps (e.g., 5-185°, then 10-190°, etc.). To measure the strength of any link between theta phase and spike-LFP phase coupling at higher frequencies, we hypothesized a signature shape, with a peak in theta-dependent spike-LFP phase coupling separated from a trough by approximately 180°(i.e., the same signature shape that we previously hypothesized for relationships between oscillatory phase and the likelihood of visual-target detection). That is, we hypothesized that there would be a theta phase with particularly strong spike-LFP phase coupling (at higher frequencies), and 180°away from that phase, a theta phase with particularly weak spike-LFP phase coupling (at higher frequencies). Based on this hypothesis, we reduced theta-dependent, spike-LFP phase coupling functions to a single value for each frequency by applying FFTs and keeping the second component 68 . This second component represents the amplitude of an oscillation with a single cycle, matching our hypothesized shape (see Fig. 4a ). Higher oscillatory power is associated with more reliable phase estimates. Changes in power as a function of theta phase (i.e., PAC) could thus create spurious relationships between spike-LFP phase coupling and theta phase. We controlled for this relationship between power and phase estimates by conducting a control analysis that equated higher-frequency power between theta-phase bins. We compared theta-phase bins centered at 90°and 270°, using the ft_stratify function from the FieldTrip toolbox (Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior), which also equates sample sizes. A key element of this stratification procedure is a subsampling of the original dataset to equate power, with this subsampling being somewhat different on each run. We therefore re-ran the stratification procedure 1500 times. Figure 7b displays the mean and standard deviation of these power-equating iterations, confirming the theta-dependent results shown in Fig. 7a . Granger causality. We estimated the influence of the different ROIs on each other (e.g., the influence of mdPul on LIP) by measuring Granger causality when response fields in each ROI overlapped the cued location. We first downsampled the data to 250 Hz, subtracted the mean, and then divided by the standard deviation. For MVAR modeling, with the BSMART toolbox for MATLAB 70 , we used a model order of 8, which generally corresponded to the first Akaike information criterion value. For paired estimates (e.g., mdPul vs. LIP), we averaged across all recording sessions when each of two ROIs had overlapping response fields. We also calculated conditional Granger causality for a subset of recording sessions when all three ROIs had overlapping response fields (N = 31). Conditional Granger causality measures the influence of one brain area (Y) on another (X), after taking into account additional areas (Z). The general pattern of results for Granger causal influence between ROIs (Fig. 6 ) remained the same when instead applying conditional Granger causality (Supplementary Figure 5 ). We also examined Granger causal influence as a function of theta phase. We first used a two-cycle wavelet to measure the phase of theta-band activity just prior to target presentation. The wavelet was centered at -250 ms. We then sorted trials into two theta-phase bins (see Fig. 4a ), one centered on the theta phase associated with enhanced perceptual sensitivity (i.e., the "good" theta phase) and the other centered on the theta phase associated with diminished perceptual sensitivity (i.e., the poor theta phase). For each theta-phase bin, we measured Granger causal influence using an epoch also centered at -250 ms (prior to target presentation), but only overlapping a time period equivalent to half of a theta cycle. For statistical testing, we re-shuffled the trial data and re-calculated Granger causality for each of 1500 iterations. We then compared the compiled reference distribution of differences between, for example, mdPul to LIP and LIP to mdPul Granger causal influence to the observed values (controlling for multiple comparisons). Cross-frequency PAC. We first examined PAC between FEF and LIP, focusing exclusively on the relationship between oscillatory phase in one region and highfrequency band (HFB) activity (from 80 to 200 Hz) in the other. HFB is an established proxy for population spiking 39 . We convolved complex Morlet wavelets with the LFP signal prior to target presentation (from -750 to -200 ms, in 10-ms steps), using the results to (i) derive phase estimates from 9 to 35 Hz (in 1-Hz steps) and (ii) to extract HFB activity. To get HFB, we first calculated power in 10-Hz steps (i.e., 80, 90, 100…). We then baseline corrected these power estimates by means of a z-score, relative to the pre-cue baseline, before averaging across HFB frequencies (from 80 to 200 Hz). Note that this approach accounts for the 1/f signal drop off in HFB at increasing frequencies. We next sorted frequency-specific phase estimates (from 9 to 35 Hz) and calculated average HFB power within overlapping 180°phase bins (e.g., 0-180°), shifting the smoothing window in 5°steps (e.g., 5-185°, then 10-190°, etc.). To aid in visual comparisons across frequencies, we normalized these phase-power relationships by subtracting and dividing by the average power across all phases (separately for each frequency). We then multiplied by 100 to reveal the percent modulation in HFB power as a function of the oscillatory phase. The preceding steps (i.e., binning power estimates by phase) are similar to other approaches that measure PAC 71, 72 . Here, we specifically hypothesized that PAC should have a signature shape, with a peak in PAC separated from a trough by approximately 180°(i.e., the same signature shape that we previously hypothesized for relationships between oscillatory phase and the likelihood of visual-target detection). We therefore reduced phase-power functions to a single value for each phase-providing frequency by applying the FFT to each function (i.e., at each frequency, from 3 to 60 Hz) and keeping the second component. This second component represents a one-cycle sine wave, matching the hypothesized shape of our phase-power functions. The amplitude of this one-cycle, sinusoidal component -determined both by how closely the function approximated a one-cycle sine wave and by the effect size-was used to measure the strength of PAC 4, 68 . We used the same procedure to measure within-region PAC for mdPul (Supplementary Figure 3 ), specifically examining the link between theta phase (at 5 Hz) and higherfrequency power (from 9 to 60 Hz). We previously reported within-region PAC (from 9 to 60 Hz) for FEF and LIP 11 . We also used this procedure to examine PAC between alpha/low-beta phase and gamma power, separately for the "good" and "poor" theta-phase bins (Fig. 8 ). For statistical testing, we (i) shuffled our observed pre-target phase estimates (1500 times) relative to observed power (breaking the relationship between phase and power) and (ii) repeated our analysis steps. We then compared the magnitude of resulting reference distributions to the observed PAC (accounting for multiple comparisons). Fig. 1 1 Fig.1Penetrations targeting the atlas-defined mediodorsal pulvinar (mdPul). We previously published representative penetrations for FEF and LIP 4 . Here, a red line depicts each penetration. The numbers positioned between images from each of the animals represent anterior-posterior distances from the interaural line (mm). Atlas-defined pulvinar subdivisions: dashed blue = medial pulvinar; dashed yellow = lateral pulvinar; dashed red = inferior pulvinar. The white R = right hemisphere Fig. 6 6 Fig.6Granger causal influence indicates that mdPul regulates alpha/low-beta activity in cortex. a For each pair of ROIs, Granger causal influence (model order = 8) was based on all recording sessions with overlapping response fields (mdPul vs. FEF, N = 51; mdPul vs. LIP, N = 57; FEF vs. LIP, N = 67). Supplementary Figure4instead shows conditional Granger causality for a subset of sessions when all three ROIs had overlapping response fields (N = 31). Panel b shows Granger causal influence after binning based on theta phase ("good" vs. "poor"). mdPul specifically regulates cortical activity during periods of relatively better visual-target detection (i.e., during the "good" theta phase). Shaded regions around the lines represent SEs Fig. 8 8 Fig.8PAC in LIP between alpha/low-beta phase and gamma power is state-dependent. We measured phase-amplitude coupling after first binning trials based on the theta phase, with one bin centered on the "good" theta phase (i.e., the phase associated with better visual-target detection) and the other centered on the "bad" theta phase (i.e., the phase associated with worse visual-target detection). Panels a, b show power as a function of alpha/low-beta phase by theta-phase bin (good vs. poor) and by attention condition (cued [orange] vs. non-cued [blue]), for both a LIP (N = 96) and b mdPul (N = 95). c, d The strength of PAC was measured by using the fast Fourier transform to extract the amplitude of a one-cycle, sinusoidal component (see Fig.2afor an illustration of this approach), for both c LIP and d mdPul.

INTRODUCTION Many foragers pursue fleeing prey. The ability to effectively pursue prey is thus a critical element in our behavioral repertoires 1, 2 . To pursue effectively, a forager needs to perform a series of computations: it must maintain a representation of its current position relative to that of the prey, then compute a best path to capture the prey, then execute that path. Because the ability to perform such computations can determine foraging success, pursuit has likely been an important driver of our cognition and its underlying brain systems [3] [4] [5] . One way to improve pursuit effectiveness is to predict the future position of the prey and head towards the predicted position 6 . Estimating future positions can be done using the prey's basic Newtonian variables (most importantly, its current position, velocity, and acceleration) and can be improved using additional (potentially even recursive) variables, such as predictions about the likely evasive strategy of the prey in response to the predator's own future path. By using such information, the forager may be able to formulate a representation of the predicted future position of the prey. The ability of non-human animals to actively predict positions of prey during pursuit is poorly understood. Nonetheless, predictive pursuit is an important part of the repertoire of many species. Prediction is important for many cognitive and behavioral processes, not just foraging. These include motor control, economic decision-making, and abstract long-term planning [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . There is some evidence that foraging animals can predict the long-term future -that is, they may be able to travel mentally in time and see themselves in the future 12, 13 . However, observations about animal prediction tend to be limited to a small number of highly adapted species in unique contexts. And, while future planning of movements is relatively wellstudied, the ability to predict future positions of prey during dynamic behavior with rapidly changing goals -which feed into but are distinct from motor plans -is not. In the context of pursuit, a critical question is whether future-predicting foragers maintain a specific representation of potential future prey positions and whether those representations (assuming they exist) make use of specialized processes. Although the neural bases of predictive pursuit remain unclear, we can draw some inferences about its likely neuroanatomy. In particular, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been implicated in prediction, prospection, and related processes [14] [15] [16] [17] . For example, neuroimaging studies indicate that human dACC is a key region for economic prediction 18 , for prospective reasoning 8 and for more open-ended prospective processes 18 . The dACC is well-positioned for this role: it receives broad inputs from limbic and cognitive systems, integrates these, and generates high-level control signals that regulate behavior in an abstract and high-level way 16, [19] [20] [21] . Here, we examined the future predicting abilities of rhesus macaques using a novel virtual pursuit task. Subjects used a joystick to move an avatar in an open two-dimensional field displayed on a computer screen. Subjects, controlling the avatar, pursued a fleeing prey item that used an artificially intelligent (AI) algorithm to avoid predation. By examining the properties of a generative model fit to our data, we found that our subjects moved towards extrapolated future positions of prey rather than just pointing towards the preys' present positions. Our subjects' made their predictions based on three Newtonian variables associated with the current state, but not other factors that could further improve predictions (such as the effect of the subject's movements on the future position of the prey). We also found that neurons in dACC were selective for those three Newtonian variables (and not others), indicating that responses in this region provide sufficient information to generate the types of predictions our subjects made. Finally, we found that dACC neurons used a spatial code to explicitly represent the predicted future position of the prey, and that this future representation is multiplexed with the representation of current Newtonian variables. RESULTS Behavioral results Three macaques (Macaca mulatta, subjects K, H, and C) used a joystick to control the position of an avatar (a yellow or purple circle) moving continuously and smoothly in a rectangular field on a computer screen (Figure 1 , Supplementary Video 1 and Methods). On each trial, subjects had up to 20 seconds to capture a prey item (a fleeing colored square) to obtain a juice reward. Prey avoided the avatar with a deterministic strategy that combined repulsion from the subject's current position with repulsion from the walls of the field. The prey item was drawn randomly from a set of five, identified by color, that differed in maximum velocity and associated reward size. All subjects showed stable behavior within twelve 2-hour training sessions that followed a longer training period on joystick use (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2 ). All data presented here were collected after the training sessions (number of trials, K: 3229; H: 3890; C: 2512). Subjects successfully captured the prey in over 95% of trials and, on successful trials, did so in an average of 5.04 seconds (K: 4.26 sec; H: 5.32 sec; C: 5.54 sec) and median of 3.62 seconds (K: 3.36sec; H: 3.73 sec; C: 3.93 sec). Subjects' performance varied lawfully with prey type, indicating sensitivity to manipulation of reward and/or difficulty (Supplementary Figure 1 ). Behavioral evidence of future state prediction For analysis purposes, we split all data into one-second segments (Supplementary Figure 3 ). Within each segment, we calculated the error (sum of squares) between the model (see below) and the behavior at each frame (i.e., each 16.67 ms). For each segment, we computed the minimum point on a 201×201 matrix of intensities for each parameter pair (force by time, Figure 2 , see below). We then averaged over all segments and all trials, separately for the three subjects. We developed a generative model of behavior (see Methods). We used the variable τ (tau) to refer to the prediction parameter for each subject. The variable τ comes from the model and refers to a fit scalar variable, which is multiplied by future position (see the equations in Methods section "Behavioral Model"). In practice, it can be interpreted as the distance into the future that the subject prospects to guide his behavior (Figure 2A ). The variable τ can have positive, negative, or zero values. A positive value for τ indicates that the subject points towards the expected future position of the prey -that is, the strategy reflects prediction. A zero τ indicates that the subject points the joystick directly at the current position of the prey. A negative value for τ indicates that the subject points the joystick towards where the prey was in the recent past. Note that all of these strategies (within limits) are capable of eventually catching all prey, since the subject's avatar is, by design, faster than the prey. The scalar parameter κ (kappa) reflects the amount of force applied toward the direction of the predicted position. Thus, a negative value indicates that force is exerted away from (180 degrees opposite) the prey's position, whereas a positive value indicates that force is exerted towards it. We also added an inertia term to the model. Specifically, we computed an inertially biased path for each 16.67 ms frame. The biased path is a vector sum of the computed best predicted direction and the previous direction (P subject (t) -P subject (t-1)). In our implementation, these two terms have equal weighting. Note that in practice, their relative weighting may nonetheless vary because the force term (κ, which is fit in the model), affects the weight of the new direction relative to the past direction. This approach for implementing inertia is designed to align intuitively with how inertia works (see Methods, Supplementary Figure 2 , and Supplementary 4). We called our first model the physics variable based prediction model (PVBP). It assumes that subjects' prediction derives from the prey's current position, velocity (i.e. both speed and direction), and acceleration (which includes both direction and magnitude of acceleration), as well as further derivatives, see Supplementary Figure 5 ). For all three subjects, the best fitting τ is positive, indicating that they point the joystick towards the prey's future position. For ease of interpretation, we translated τ into time units by calculating the distance between the current position and estimated position, then divided that quantity by the average velocity of the prey across the session. The results of this calculation indicate that subjects K, H and C pointed the joystick towards the position that the prey would occupy in an average of 800 ms, 767 ms, and 733 ms in the future, respectively. In the context of the task, these numbers are substantial: they reflect 18.78%, 14.42%, and 13.23% of the average trial duration for K, H, and C, respectively. To determine whether the positive prediction parameter τ is significantly greater than zero, we performed a bootstrap (randomization test making use of resampling with replacement) of heatmap slices from each segment (individual heatmap from 500 segments). This resampling was performed 500 times and resulting heatmaps were added. Then the τ and κ that best explain each segment (that is, the one resulting in the lowest cost) were selected in each resampling. We confirmed that the estimated value τ and κ are both greater than zero more than 99% of the time (i.e., p<0.01). The distance into the future that our subjects predicted did not detectably depend on the speed of the prey (linear regression between reward/speed and mean τ, K: β=3.0316, p=0.1110; H: β=4.5798, p=0.1791; C: β=7.1007, p=0.0957; the term β refers to the regression coefficient for speed against neural activity). We next asked whether taking more complex paths (ones with more turns vs. more straight paths) affected prediction span. Prey path complexity (as measured by path curvature estimated by average angle method) affected prediction. Specifically, subjects predicted less far into the future when the prey path had more curves (K: β=-0.0687; H: β=-0.0567; C: β=-0.0898, p<0.0001 for each). Thus, subjects had the ability to dynamically adjust their own prediction in light of changing circumstances. Alternative models do not predict trajectories as well as physics-based prediction We next compared the physics-based model to two other models implementing different prediction algorithms (Figure 2B ). First, the veridical prediction (VP) model assumes that the subjects will make perfect predictions that incorporate all game dynamics, including preys' repulsion from the walls and the subject's avatar. This means that a subject that makes a veridical prediction takes into account the effect his own movements will have on the prey's strategy. Second, the cost contour map prediction (CCMP) model is the same as VP but excludes repulsion from the avatar, meaning that the subject's prediction model for the prey would not take into account their own motion. We compared the performance of each model by computing the sum of squares error between the prediction trajectory and the observed trajectories over all time bins. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we found that the PVBP fit better than the other two models in our well-trained subjects (K: 7.529×10 6 , for subject K, second best was VP: 7.542×10 6 ; H, PVBP: 8.923×10 6 ; for subject H, second best was CMPP: 8.950×10 6 , Figure 2D ). We fit each segment with distinct τ and κ parameters, and we fit these same two parameters for each of our three models. As a consequence, the comparison of models can be done directly without concern of potential bias toward any specific model. In other words, by fitting each of the three models subject to identical constraints, we ensured a fair comparison across models. For the less well-trained subject, C, the CCMP model explained trajectories most accurately (7.955×10 6 ). We speculated that one factor that may influence strategy is the speed of the prey. Indeed, we found that all three subjects used PVBP more frequently when the speed of the prey was faster (Supplementary Figure 6 ). Note that this observed link between speed and the fit of the PVBP occurs even in our third (less fully trained) subject (p < 0.001, logistic regression, Supplementary Figure 6 ). In any case, our model's classification of strategies appears to be robust: the same results were obtained using a different method. Specifically, we fit all individual segments to the best model and computed the model that fits the most overall number of segments (Figure 2D and Methods). Doing the fitting this way may seem excessively flexible. That is, using two times the number of segments might allow us to fit only noise. (Consider, for example, the case of fitting 9 data points with 9th-order polynomial curve). On the other hand, the extra freedom may allow us to better fit signal -or, of course, it may fit both noise and signal. The key question, then, is whether using a large number of parameters makes the fit better despite the possibility of fitting noise. To answer this question, we directly compared the two approaches (Supplementary Figure 3 ). Specifically, we compared a model assigning two parameters globally versus one applying two parameters for each one-second segment (i.e., Monkey K: 28,164; Monkey H: 35,308; Monkey C: 20,720 parameters, Supplementary Figure 3 ). We then used AIC to compare models. We found that the second-by-second fitting resulted in lower AIC values, implying a better fit, than the 2-parameter counterpart. Specifically, in this figure, for all individual subjects, the change in AIC (AIC for global parameter model minus AIC for second-by-second model) was positive -implying the model fit by second-by-second model explains the data better than the counterpart -for the best physics-based model explaining the subject's behavior. Overall, the model comparison results showed that subjects predict the upcoming position of the prey using Newtonian physics but ignore the walls and their own influence on the prey. That is, subjects use a simplified approximation of the structure of the game to make future predictions; presumably this simplified one is sufficient to generate good predictions with lower mental effort costs. Indeed, the correlation between speed of prey and subjects' reliance on physics based prediction (a result confirmed with two different analytical approaches) suggests that prediction might have a computational cost. Prediction-related information encoded in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex Based on its role as a nexus for motivational, cognitive, and motor information 15, 20 , and its demonstrated role in human prospection 8, 22 , we hypothesized that dACC would be critical for predictive pursuit (Figure 3A ). We fit a statistically unbiased Linear-Nonlinear Generalized Linear Model (GLM 23, 24 ) to responses of 150 well-isolated dACC neurons (K: n=31; H: n=119). For this analysis, we focused on the entire trial period rather than preselecting epochs. Position, velocity, and acceleration of the prey were all encoded by significant proportions of neurons (Figure 3 ; position: 62.00%, n=93/150; speed: 35.33%, n=53/150; 36.67%; direction: n=55/150, acceleration: 24.67%, n=37/150, p<0.001 in all cases, two-way binomial test). The model fit shown in magenta is the shape of reconstructed filter (examples, Figure 3C, D ). According to the GLM, jerk, the derivative of acceleration, is not encoded (see Supplementary Figure 5 ). Jerk also did not measurably affect the subject's neural responses (it only modulated 2.00% of cells, n=3/150, p=0.1288, two-way binomial test). Together, these results indicate that dACC ensembles carry the major raw ingredients that our subjects use to predict prey positions. We wondered whether ostensible coding for prey variables could be the byproduct of coding for self-position, since self-position and prey position do tend to be somewhat correlated. We therefore repeated our GLM analyses but included self-position, self-direction, and selfspeed as explanatory factors and considered variance explained by prey parameters only after accounting for these variables. Doing this, the proportion of neurons selective for the prey's position information remained significant (n=108/167, 64.50%; p < 0.001, two-way binomial test), as did neurons selective for prey speed (n=31/167, 22.16%; p<0.001, twoway binomial test), and direction (n=20/167, 11.98%, p < 0.001, two-way binomial test). Note, for this analysis, we included a small subset of neurons, n=17, that were excluded from the previous analysis. Results do not differ if we use the same slightly smaller set of neurons. Neurons in dACC encode future position We next asked whether dACC neurons encode the future position of the prey. For each neuron, we refit the GLM using an additional parameter, the position of the prey at time t in the future. We selected the time t (t=833ms) that was most similar to the value of τ resulting from our generative model, that is, the one indicating the most likely time span of prediction (733, 766, and 800 for the three subjects, respectively) subject to the additional constraint of being a multiple of 166.67 (i.e. 10 frames). Note that although this value was chosen in advance, it aligns with the empirically derived measure of peak future position coding (Figure 4D , see below). Our analysis approach deals with the problem of correlation between the set of current Newtonian variables (including current position) and future position by assigning all explanatory power to the set of current variables first, and only counting as significant any additional variance explained by future position (see Methods). Despite this conservative criterion, we found that responses of 24.67% of dACC neurons are selective for the prey's future position at time t (n=37/150). Visual inspection of the neurons' filters shows that their selectivity is complex (examples are shown in Figure 4C ). That is, they are positionally tuned, but, unlike place cells, have nonpoint-like shapes. They contain multiple peaks. They do not appear to be smooth gradients. Instead, they appeared to be heterogeneously spatially tuned. In this manner, they resemble recently identified non-grid-like space-selective cells in entorhinal cortex 23 . Notably, conventional methods for detecting place/grid-like cells will greatly underestimate the proportion of such tuning. We next asked how strongly dACC neurons encode the future position of the prey. We calculated the proportion of log likelihood increase (LLi) between the current position model and the current plus future model (Figure 4A ). Our neurons showed a wide range of marginal variance explained. On average, adding the future position term improved variance explained by 6.89% (the mean of this proportion is significantly different from zero, p<0.001, Wilcoxon sign-rank test, Figure 4A inset ). We then asked whether these newly discovered future position cells constitute a separate class of neurons from the cells that tracked the current position of the prey. To do this, we computed the explanatory variance accounted for by future position (variance explained by the combined model minus variance explained by current position) and current position, as defined by log likelihood improvement (LLi) in fitting. We found a positive correlation between these variables (Figure 4B ), indicating current and future position were multiplexed in the same population of cells (r = 0.7394, p < 0.001, cf. 25 ). To quantify the difference between current and future position coding, we fit separate models: one incorporated current position plus current Newtonian variables; the other was the same but used future position (assuming t=833 ms) instead of current position. For the 36 neurons with significant tuning for both current and future position, we calculated the similarity between the filters, using a technique known as spatial efficiency, SPAEF 26 (Figure 4C ). A zero SPAEF indicates orthogonal filters; positive SPAEF indicates similar filters; negative SPAEF indicates anticorrelated filters. Although the mean of the spatial efficiency for our neurons was positive, it was not significantly so, and spanned a large range of values from negative to positive (mean of population spatial efficiency=0.0440, Wilcoxon sign-rank test, p=0.3790). Finally, we assessed future encoding by examining the accuracy of model fitting to each of several possible future times, ranging from 0 to 1333 ms in the future. We ran a type of sliding window analysis that involved sampling one frame (16.67 ms) every ten frames (166.67 ms) and ignoring the intervening nine frames. We found that the value of 833 ms fits the largest number of neurons. (Values around it fit many neurons too). Specifically, the plurality, 24.67% of neurons, were tuned for prey position at 833 ms (Figure 4D ). The roughly equivalent value of the neural and the behaviorally fit prospective distance (733 and 800 ms for those two subjects) suggests that these neurons encode the future position of prey on the same approximate timescale as the subject actively predicts. We considered the possibility that this peak at 833 ms was due to some unanticipated correlation between positions in the future and at the present. If this were so, then the average distance of the self and/or prey would show a local minimum at a point in the future corresponding to the peak. However, we did not see this. On the contrary, we found that the distance increases monotonically for both subjects (Figure 4E ). State information is not confounded with gaze information Activity in dACC is selective for saccadic direction, and may therefore also correlate with gaze direction (although this has not, to our knowledge, been shown 27 ). Consequently, it is possible that our spatial kernels may reflect not task state but gaze information. Specifically, what appears to be tuning for future position may instead be attributable to the fact that monkeys looked towards the predicted future prey position. We tested this possibility by calculating the Euclidean distance between eye position and prey position in a range from -80 to +80 frames (Figure 5A ). The distance between eye and prey position was the closest at -5 frames (77.09 pixels), indicating that eye position lagged prey position. Thus, if gaze direction were a major confound, it would show up as increased selectivity for past positions, not prediction of future positions. Likewise, the chance that prey velocity encoding is a by-product of eye velocity encoding was belied by the stark differences between gaze speed and prey speed (p <0.001, Wilcoxon sign rank test, but also clear from visual inspection of Figure 5B ). Finally, we repeated our GLM analyses (see above) but included eye position (only for the one subject from which we collected gaze data). We found that that the number of tuned neurons for the prey did not substantially change; that is, that adding in gaze position as a regressor did not qualitatively change our results (Figure 5C ). Encoding of reward and reward proximity in dACC Research based on conventional choice tasks indicates that dACC neurons track values of potential rewards 28 . We next asked how dACC encodes anticipated rewards in our more complex task. We found that, averaging over all other variables, the value of the pursued reward modulates activity of 8.67% of neurons (n=13/150, using a simple linear regression of firing rate against value; this proportion is greater than chance, p=0.038, one-way binomial test). Note that this analysis ignores the potential encoding of prey speed, which is perfectly correlated with static reward in our task design. We hypothesized that reward/speed would be encoded in a modulatory manner 29 , that is, that the pursued reward/speed would alter the shape of the tuning for other task variables, rather than be multiplexed (Figure 6A ). To test this hypothesis, we split our dataset by reward size and, as a control, split it randomly. We found that for several variables (prey position, prey direction, and prey speed), value splits produced greater differences than random ones (purple bar, p = 0.0221 for prey speed, and p < 0.001 for other prey variables, Figure 6B ). This result indicates that the reward information encoded in dACC interacts mathematically with encoding of other variables. In other words, selectivity is mixed. A good deal of research suggests that dACC neurons also signal the approach in time of impending rewards [30] [31] [32] , even in continuous tasks 33 . We thus asked whether it does so here. We repeated our GLM, including relative (self-to-prey) distance as an explanatory variable. We found that 38.67% of neurons (n=58/150) were tuned for self-prey distance. Interestingly, this relationship is heterogeneous -of these 58 neurons, 31.03% (n=18/58) showed a positive slope and 18.97 % (n=11/58) showed a negative slope. This bias is not itself significant (p=0.2649 for rise and fall bias, n = 18/29; p = 1.000 for monotonic bias, n = 29/59, binomial test in all cases). This result indicates that while dACC neurons do track the approach to reward, they do not show an overall rise or fall in activity as they do so. DISCUSSION Pursuit is an important element of the behavioral repertoire of many foragers 2, 5, 34 . The algorithmic bases of pursuit have recently attracted the interest of scholars in ecology, engineering, psychology, and other disciplines 6, 33, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Nonetheless, we know very little about how pursuit decisions occur in real time, and we know even less about their neuronal underpinnings. Here, we examined how macaques pursue virtual prey in a continuous, timevarying task. We developed a generative model based on a large dataset. The result of this model suggests that our subjects follow a predictive strategy. That is, instead of pointing towards the position of the prey, they extrapolate the future positions of prey and use this prediction to adjust their heading. This strategy is more efficient (yields more reward per unit time) but may be more computationally demanding than a simpler one that would involve pointing at and tracking the current position of the prey. These results demonstrate that pursuing animals can adopt complex future-predicting strategies that improve performance. We found that dACC neurons track the elemental physical variables our subjects use to predict the future and explicitly encode the prediction. Specifically, we found that firing rate responses of neurons in dACC encode three Newtonian variables (position, velocity, and acceleration) that our subjects used to track the prey and predict future prey positions. The same neurons carry an additional representation of the future position of the prey that is multiplexed with the Newtonian variables rather than maintained in a separate pool of specialized neurons. Both representations make use of a two-dimensional response field, akin to place fields in hippocampus, but not localized to a single position. Specifically, spatial representation in dACC is qualitatively similar to place representations of non-grid cells in entorhinal cortex 23 . It is notable that dACC uses partially distinct spatial tuning functions to track the present and future positions of the prey, thus in principle allowing unambiguous decoding for a given population response. Our work is directly inspired by important studies identifying mechanisms underlying pursuit in other animals 36, 37, 40 . Our work goes beyond these studies by developing a generative model, that is, a model that seeks to understand how the data are generated 41 . One benefit of the generative model is that it lets us probe how the decision is made at every time step and make guesses about the underlying mental process leading to decision. The generative model in turn is vital for extending our understanding of mechanism to the neuronal level. This model allows us to generate results that provide novel insight into the role of dACC in cognition. First, our results emphasize the core role of dACC in prediction, a role that is central to other theories, albeit not ones that directly involve pursuit 8, 14, 17, 18, 42, 43 . One recent study is particularly relevant to these results 17 . The authors examined hemodynamic activity in human dACC during a complex decision-making task in which subjects had to track previous rewards and use a reinforcement learning-like mechanism to formulate a future prediction and make the best choice. They found that dACC tracks multiple variables, but was particularly selective for long-term estimates of expected prediction errors. These results highlight the key role of dACC in prediction in general and suggest its role is conserved across species (see also 17 ). Second, our findings highlight the importance of dACC to navigation. While studies of navigation typically focus on the medial temporal lobe, a growing body of work has begun to explore the role of cingulate cortex, which receives direct projections from medial temporal regions 22, 44 . There are several important limitations to the present work. First, and most obviously, our subjects were not performing a truly naturalistic task; they were performing a laboratory task that required specialized training. Future studies will be needed to ascertain whether these results relate to natural pursuit contexts that are ostensibly similar, such as pursuit of insects in the peripersonal space 45, 46 . Second, and relatedly, the task space we used was greatly constrained -both agents were restricted to a small rectangular space and had strict speed limits. Subjects had full information about the position of the prey at all times. To understand prediction more fully, it will be critical to extend to contexts in which some information is hidden. Traditional laboratory tasks that study topics of interest to cognitive neuroscience -decisionmaking and executive control -have discrete steps and force the brain to adjust to that structure 47 . One reason we developed the prey pursuit task is that it embeds those cognitive processes in a continuous time-varying task. Doing so allows us to study one of the brain's greatest strengths -its ability to adjust and change its mind on the fly as new evidence comes in [47] [48] [49] [50] , and to incorporate that into future plans. Material and Methods Subjects. All animal procedures were approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources at the University of Rochester and/or the University of Minnesota and were designed and conducted in compliance with the Public Health Service's Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. Three male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) served as subjects for the behavior; two of them also served as subjects for the physiology. Age of subjects was 9 (subject K), 10 (subject C), and 10 (subject H), Subjects had never previously been exposed to decisionmaking tasks in which they could use a joystick to pursue a moving prey. Previous training history for these subjects included two types of foraging tasks 51, 52 , intertemporal choice tasks 53 , several types of gambling tasks [54] [55] [56] , attentional tasks (similar to those in ref 57 ), and two types of reward-based decision tasks 58, 59 . Experimental apparatus. The joystick was a modified version of commercially available joysticks with a built-in potentiometer (Logitech Extreme Pro 3D). The control bar was removed and replaced with a control stick (a 15 cm plastic dowel) topped with a 3 cm diameter plastic sphere designed to be easy for macaques to manipulate. The joystick position was read out by a custom coded program in Matlab running on the stimulus-control computer. The joystick was controlled by an algorithm that detected the positional change of the joystick and limited the maximum pixel movement to within 23 pixels in 16.67 ms. Task design. At the beginning of each trial, two shapes appeared on a gray computer monitor placed directly in front of the subject. The yellow (subject K) or purple (subjects H and C) circle (15-pixel diameter) represented the subject. Subject position was determined by the joystick and was limited by the screen boundaries. A square shape (30-pixel length) represented the prey. The movement of the prey was determined by a simple AI (see below). Each trial ended with either the successful capture of the prey or after 20 seconds, whichever came first. Successful capture was defined as any spatial overlap between the avatar circle and the prey square. Capture resulted in immediate juice reward; juice amount corresponded to prey color: orange (0.3 mL), blue (0.4 mL), green (0.5 mL), violet (0.6 mL), and cyan (0.7 mL). The path of the prey was generated interactively using A-star pathfinding methods, which are commonly used in video gaming 60 . For every frame (16.67 ms), we computed the cost of 15 possible future positions the prey could move to in the next time-step. These 15 positions were spaced equally on the circumference of a circle centered on the prey's current position, with a radius equal to the maximum distance the prey could travel within one time-step. The cost in turn was based on two factors: the position in the field and the position of the subject's avatar. The field that the prey moved in had a built-in bias for cost, which made the prey more likely to move towards the center (Figure 1B ). The cost due to distance from the subject's avatar was transformed using a sigmoidal function: the cost became zero beyond a certain distance so that the prey did not move, and it became greater as distance from the subject's avatar decreased. Eventually, the costs from these 15 positions were calculated and the position with the lowest cost was selected for the next movement. If the next movement was beyond the screen range (1920×1080 resolution), then the position with the second lowest cost was selected, and so on. The maximum speed of the subject was 23 pixels per frame (and each frame was 16.67 ms). The maximum and minimum speeds of the prey varied across subjects and were set by the experimenter to obtain a large number of trials (Figure 1 ). Specifically, speeds were selected so that subjects could capture prey on <85% of trials; these values were modified using a staircase method. If subjects missed the prey three times consecutively, then the speed of the prey was reduced. Once the subject intercepted the prey in a trial where the staircase method was used, then the selection of prey speed was randomized again. To ensure sufficient time of pursuit, the minimum distance between the initial position of each subject avatar and prey was 400 pixels. Training level estimation. Three subjects were trained for the same amount of time (8 weeks). As training progressed, each subject was exposed to a progressively more difficult (faster) suite of prey, up to a fixed maximum. Subject K and subject H reached a similar range for maximum speed of prey during the training period (K:15 pixels per frame; H: 14 pixels per frame). However, subject C only attained a maximum speed of 8 pixels per frame (Supplementary Figure 6 ). It is for this reason we refer to him as the less well-trained subject. Behavioral model. To fit each subject's movement, each trial was divided into 1-second-long segment. Each segment included 61 data points (because we used 16.67 ms resolution). We modeled these trajectories using a single prediction and a single force parameter for the entire trial, as a simplifying assumption. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that throughout a long, 20second period, there would be an active adjustment of prediction and force. Actual comparison by AIC supported our intuition, and we used segment as the unit of analysis throughout (values of 'AIC of segment/AIC of trial' was 0.9328, 0.9214, 0.9227, for subjects K, H, and C (or whatever) respectively. Overall, the position of the subject was generated according to the following: P subject (t + 1) = κ f (P subject (t)) + m where P subject (t) is position of the subject at time t, m is the inertia of subject as calculated from the joystick, and κ is the force parameter. The vector κf(P subject (t)) was then summed with the inertia m that was defined as following: m = P subject (t) -P subject (t -1) P prey (t) indicates the position of the prey at time t. The function with respect to subject position at time t was defined as: f (P subject (t)) = P prey (t + 1) -P subject (t) Then the position of the prey at time t+1 was: P prey (t + 1) = P prey (t) + τ∑ n = 0 k d n P prey (t) dt n Where the n indicates the order of derivation with respect to the time. Thus, n=1 indicates velocity, and n = 2 indicates acceleration. The Physics Variable-Based Prediction (PVBP) model incorporates one previous time step to predict the prey's next position. This approach is similar to a Kalman filter 61 . The other two models we tested do not utilize any past information. The model assuming prediction using the cost contour map (CCMP model) considers only the lowest cost location at the next time step. The model assuming veridical prediction (VP) automatically finds the exact position of the prey at the next time step. Once the prey's position on the next time step is predicted, the model computes how far this predicted position is from the agent's current position. A prediction value of 1 indicates that the future position will be as far as from the agent's current position as the prey's current position. The best-fitting parameter pairs were determined by performing a grid search across the ranges of both parameters. During this search, we tested the range of the prediction parameter between -400 to 400 subjects H and C, and -200 to 200 for subject K. (Units for this range correspond to the distance the prey moved in the previous timestep). Subjects H and C had a larger range, because over 5% of their trajectories resulted either in -200 or 200 in prediction parameter value. Representative parameters for explaining each segment were selected based on the value of the sum of squared error between the actual segment and the segment generated by the model. Significance testing for estimating parameters of behavioral model. To determine whether the positive prediction parameter was significantly greater than zero, we performed a bootstrap of heatmap slices from each segment. This resampling was performed 500 times, and selected heatmaps were added. Then, the parameter set resulting in the lowest cost was selected in each resampling. Model evaluation. To evaluate model performance and compare among models, we computed the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) using the likelihood of each model (Figure 2 , and Supplementary Figures 4 and Supplementary Figures 5). We first calculated the mean and variance of all the sum-of-squared errors across trajectories. Then we estimated the likelihood assuming a normal distribution centered on the mean of the sum-of-squared errors with a variance equivalent to the variance of the sum-of-squared errors across all trajectories. To validate whether subjects used a single prediction and force across the all the trials or adaptively changed their prediction method, we compared the AIC value between cases where the parameter pair varied across all trajectories, using only the single best parameter pair. Electrophysiological recording. One subject (H) was implanted with multiple floating microelectrode arrays (FMAs, Microprobes for Life Sciences, Gaithersburg, MD) in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). This is the region that we define as Area 24 15 and that corresponds to dACC in most other primate studies, including those from our lab 52, 54, 62 . Each FMA had 32 electrodes (impedance 0.5 MOhm, 70% Pt, 30% Ir) of various lengths to reach multiple layers within dACC. Neurons from subject K were recorded with laminar V-probes (Plexon, Inc, Dallas, TX) that had 24 contact points with 150 μm inter-contact distance. Continuous, wideband neural signals were amplified, digitized at 40 kHz and stored using the Grapevine Data Acquisition System (Ripple, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Spike sorting was done manually offline (Plexon Offline Sorter). Spike sorting was performed blind to any experimental conditions to avoid bias. Details of LN model. To test the selectivity of neurons for various experimental variables, we constructed Generalized Linear Models with navigational variables (GLM 23, 24 ). The GLM models estimated the spike rate (r i ) of one neuron during time bin t as an exponential function of the weighted sum of the relevant value of each variable at time t, which the weights are determined by set of coefficients (w i ). The estimated firing rates from the GLM models can be expressed as: r = exp(∑ i X i T w i )/dt Where r denotes a vector of firing rates for one neuron over T time points across the session, and i indexes the variables of interest, e.g. position of avatar on screen. The vector of firing rates over T time points provide the benefit for modeling the neural activity without specific time-locking to behavioral event. X i is a matrix in which each column represents a set of "state variables" of the animal (e.g. one of twelve speeds, determined by post-hoc binning) obtained from binning the continuous variable so that all the columns for a particular row are 0, except for one column. Unlike conventional tuning curve analysis, GLM analysis does not assume the parametric shape of the tuning curve a priori. Instead, the weights, which define the shape of tuning for each neuron, were optimized by maximizing the Poisson loglikelihood of the observed spike train given the model-expected spike number, with additional regularization for the smoothness of parameters in a continuous variable, and a lasso regularization for parameters in a discrete variable. Position parameters were smoothed across rows and columns separately. The regularization hyperparameter was chosen by maximizing the cross-validation log-likelihood based on several randomly selected neurons. The unconstrained optimization with gradient and Hessian was performed (MATLAB fminunc function). Model performance of each neuron was quantified by the log-likelihood of held out data under the model. This cross-validation procedure was repeated 10 times (10fold cross-validation), and overfitting was penalized. Through multiple levels of penalties, we can compare performance of models with varying complexity. Forward model selection. Model selection was based on the cross-validated log-likelihood value for each model. We first fit n models with a single variable, where n is the total number of variables. The best single model was determined by the largest increase in spike-normalized log-likelihood from the null model (i.e., the model with a single parameter representing the mean firing rate). Then, additional variables (n-1 in total) were added to the best single variable model. The best two-variable model was preferred over the single variable model only if it significantly improved the cross-validation log-likelihood (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, α = 0.05). Likewise, the procedure was continued for the three-variable model and beyond if adding more variables significantly improved model performance, and the best, simplest model was selected. The cell was categorized as not tuned to any of the variables considered if the loglikelihood increase was not significantly higher than baseline, which was mean firing rate of fitted neurons across the session. Future position models. We examined the effect of future position by fitting a GLM having 'future position' and 'current position' together as the input variable. Then we compared to the GLM model with the only current position. Difference between the two models was evidence that additional variance was explained by including future position. Comparison between current and future position filters. For this purpose, we constructed two GLMs: one with current position and current Newtonian variables (velocity and acceleration), and another with future position and current Newtonian variables. Then we selected the neurons that showed significant tuning for both models. To compare the similarity between two positional filters, we used the SPAtial EFficiency metric (SPAEF) that prior literature suggests to be more robust than the 2D spatial correlation 26 . It quantifies the similarity between two maps: SPAEFF = 1 -(A -1) 2 + (B -1) 2 -(C -1) 2 A is the Pearson correlation between two maps, B is the ratio between the coefficients of variation for each map, and C is the activity similarity measured by histogram profiles. Values near -1 indicate anticorrelated maps (one tends to be high when the other is low); 0 indicates uncorrelated maps; 1 indicates perfect matching between the two. Velocity dependent Physics Variable-Based Model (PVMP) prediction bias. We examined whether PVBP is preferred when the velocity of prey is high (Supplementary Figure 6 ). We first obtained the average velocity of the prey at each segment, and then categorized each segment as belonging to either the physics or non-physics variable-based prediction based on which fit result was best. With the prey velocity and segment category, we performed logistic regression with velocity as a predictor and category as the dependent variable (glmfit in MATLAB). The distance between current prey position and future prey position at time t rises roughly linearly with time. This finding indicates that the peaks found in panel D are not likely to be an artifact of some unforeseen periodicity in the relative paths of the subject and prey. Dashed line: maximum distance of 1 grid, which is diagonal distance. This provides a reference for the units on the y-axis. The measure of center is mean value 50 bootstrapping, and error bars are the standard deviation. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. Experimental paradigm and behavioral results.

(B) Fitting results: Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, left) across all the trajectories and percentage of trials best explained by each model (right). For calculating the AIC, we summed the log-likelihood across the whole data set from each subject individually and used the quantity (2 × number of the segments) as the number of free parameters. This quantity was: subject K, 28,164; subject H, 35,308; subject C, 20,720 parameters. Predictive models provide better fits than zero prediction ones.

Code is available at https://github.com/sbyoo/prospectpursuit/. Statistics. Error bars of log-likelihood fit increase in neural analysis are obtained by a bootstrapping cross-validation procedure (50x, (Figure 4A ). Error bars in percent tuned neuron are obtained by calculating mean for 50-time bootstrapping (Figure 4D , Figure 5C , Figure 6B ). Other error bars are the standard error of the mean (SEM) (Figure 5E , Figure 6A , Supplementary Figure 1 ). No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications both from our lab and other labs (ref 41 for the behavioral model, ref 51 and 52 for the neural data). Data were assumed to be normally distributed, but this was not formally tested. Trial conditions were generated randomly. Selection of subjects was arbitrary. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. No data points were excluded.

An ongoing stream of experiences accompanies every waking moment. Sleep is the only time in which consciousness fades under normal physiological conditions: subjects awakened from sleep, especially early in the night, report that they were not experiencing anything up to 30% of the time 1 . At other times, subjects awakened from sleep report dreams -a stream of vivid experiences that occur despite being immobile, unresponsive, and largely disconnected from the environment. Thus, unlike wakefulness, sleep can be associated with either the presence or absence of conscious experiences. In addition, experiences in dreams can assume many forms, ranging from pure perceptual experiences to pure thought, from simple images to temporally unfolding narratives, which are often similar to awake conscious states but at times can be different in interesting ways 2, 3 . The discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep -the 'third state of being' besides wake and non-REM (NREM) sleep -led initially to a straightforward view of the neural correlates of dreaming 4 : the wake-like, high-frequency, 'activated' EEG 5, 6 of REM sleep was thought to be associated with the presence of dream experiences, and the low-frequency activity of NREM sleep with the absence of dreaming. However, later studies showed that up to 70% of NREM sleep awakenings yield reports of dream experiences 1 . Conversely, in a small but consistent minority of cases, subjects deny having had any experience when awakened from REM sleep. Thus, whether one experiences something or not during sleep cannot be determined simply by assessing one's behavioral state based on traditional EEG features or neuroimaging correlates 7, 8 . The paradoxical occurrence of both the presence and absence of experiences within the same behavioral state of sleep, and across two very different kinds of sleep (NREM and REM) challenges our current understanding of the neural correlates of conscious experience in sleep. Here we investigate the neural correlates of dreaming using a within state paradigm, in both NREM and REM sleep, by performing serial awakenings of subjects recorded throughout the night with high-density EEG (256 channels) 9 . The results highlight a posterior cortical 'hot zone' where a local decrease in low-frequency EEG activity during both NREM and REM sleep is associated with reports of experiences upon awakening, whereas a local increase in low-frequency activity is associated with the absence of experience. These results hold for both a large group of naïve subjects and a smaller group of individuals trained in dream reporting. We then show, in a separate group of subjects, that it is possible to predict whether an individual will report having dreamt or not in the course of a NREM episode by real-time EEG monitoring of this posterior hot zone. Finally, we show that the location of high-frequency EEG activity during dreams correlates with specific dream contents, such as thoughts, perceptions, faces, spatial setting, movement, and speech. Results Using a serial awakening paradigm 9 , participants were awakened throughout the night and were asked to report whether, just before the awakening, they had been experiencing anything (dreaming experience, DE), experiencing something but could not remember the content (dreaming experience without recall of content, DEWR), or not experiencing anything (no experience, NE, see Methods). If subjects reported a DE they were asked to describe its most recent content ('the last thing going through your mind prior to the alarm sound'), and to rate it on a scale ranging from exclusively thought-like (thinking or reasoning, with no sensory content) to exclusively perceptual (vivid sensory content, without thinking or reasoning) 10 . Finally, they had to estimate the duration of the most recent DE, and to report whether it contained specific categories of content, including faces, a spatial setting, movement, and speech (examples of reports are presented in Supplementary table S1 ). We studied two different populations in separate experiments. In experiment 1 we studied a large group of subjects who underwent few awakenings (N=32, 233 awakenings), while in experiment 2, we investigated a smaller group of trained subjects who underwent many awakenings (N=7, 815 awakenings) (see Supplementary table S2 ). Finally, in a third experiment, we tested whether, based on the results of the first two experiments, we could predict the presence or absence of dreaming in real time at the single trial level (N=7, 84 awakenings). Dreaming experience vs no experience: low-frequency power First, we sought to determine whether and how low-frequency activity (1-4 Hz) changes between the presence and absence of conscious experience during sleep. EEG slow frequencies between 1 and 4 Hz during sleep are associated with neuronal down-states and bistability 11 , which prevent the emergence of stable causal interactions among cortical areas 12 , and have been linked to the loss of consciousness 13, 14 . For this analysis we focused on the first group of subjects (experiment 1) because of the large number of subjects, and on N2 sleep, since the number of DE and NE reports in this stage were well balanced. By computing power spectral density at the source level within the 1-4 Hz frequency band we found that reports of DE, compared to reports of NE, had decreased low-frequency power. This decrease was restricted to a bilateral parieto-occipital region, encompassing the medial and lateral occipital lobe and extending superiorly to the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus (Fig. 1A ). Experiment 2, in which awakenings were carried out both in N2 and N3 stage sleep, confirmed these results (Supplementary Figure 1 ). We then compared instances in which the subjects reported that they had dreaming experiences, but were not able to recall the content of the experience (DEWR), with instances in which they reported being unconscious (i.e., having no experiences, NE). Reports of DEWR, contrasted to reports of NE, were again preceded by decreased lowfrequency power in a parieto-occipital region highlighted by the DE/NE contrast (Fig. 1B , see Supplementary Figure 2 for a conjunction map of the two contrasts). A contrast between DE and DEWR in the low-frequency range did not yield significant differences. Thus, decreased low-frequency power in this posterior cortical zone was associated with reports of dreaming experiences, irrespective of the ability to remember the contents of the experience. Next, we asked whether the contrast between DE and NE would produce similar results also during REM sleep, a state that is substantially different from NREM sleep in terms of EEG signatures (slow waves and spindles in NREM sleep, low-voltage fast activity in REM sleep 4 ), neural activity (widespread bistability between down and up-states in NREM sleep, mostly tonic depolarization in REM sleep 6 ), neuromodulation (high acetylcholine in REM sleep, low in NREM sleep 15 ), and regional activations 7 . Because of the rarity of NE reports in REM sleep (Supplementary table S2 ), for this analysis we combined the data of experiments 1 and 2 (N=10). Despite the notable physiological differences between NREM and REM sleep states, we again found that brain activity associated with DE, as compared to NE, had reduced power in the 1-4 Hz band in a parieto-occipital region (Fig. 2A ), which largely overlapped with the topography observed in NREM sleep (Fig. 2B ). Thus, a decrease in low-frequency power in a posterior cortical 'hot zone' is highlighted when individuals reported experiencing a dream compared with reports of an absence of experience during sleep, irrespective of the ability to recall the experience and of behavioral state (NREM vs. REM sleep). Dreaming experience vs no experience: high-frequency power We then investigated differences in high-frequency band power (20-50 Hz), since high EEG frequencies often reflect high rates of neuronal firing 16, 17 and may thus indicate brain regions that show increased activity. In NREM sleep, DEs, compared to NE, were associated with increased high-frequency power in the same parieto-occipital region that showed reduced low frequency power. However, differences in high-frequency power extended superiorly and anteriorly to parts of the lateral frontal cortex and the temporal lobes (Fig. 3A , see also Supplementary Figure 3 for better comparability with REM sleep (25-50 Hz range)). DE with recall of content, compared to DEWR, were associated with higher highfrequency power in medial and lateral frontoparietal areas (Fig. 3B ). No differences in highfrequency power were found when comparing DEWR with NE (Supplementary Figure 4 ). Finally, in REM sleep DEs compared to NEs were associated with increased high-frequency (25-50 Hz) power in frontal and temporal regions (Fig. 3C ). Given the age variability in our sample, an additional repeated measures ANCOVA was performed in the significant clusters using this parameter as nuisance covariate. A significant main effect of report type (DE, NE) was confirmed for both low-frequency (F (1,30) =9.39, p=0.005) and high-frequency activity (F (1,30) =10.88, p=0.003), while no significant effects of age emerged (low-frequency: F (1,30) =2.34, p = 0.14; high-frequency: F (1,30) =1.80, p = 0.19). To test whether our results were characterized by a significant hemispheric lateralization, we computed a repeated-measure-ANOVA with hemisphere and type of report (DE, DEWR, NDE) as within-subject factors for all the contrasts (See 'Online Methods' and Supplementary table 5 ). We did not find significant interactions between the type of report and hemisphere, except for a barely significant right-sided lateralization (p= 0.046) for the high-frequency power contrast between DE and NE in REM sleep. Absolute power values for DE and NE in the posterior hot zone are shown in Supplementary Figure 5 . It should be noted that absolute low-frequency power values are higher in NREM sleep compared to REM sleep, although differences are comparable and significant in both sleep stages. It is likely that the absolute values in NREM sleep, although obtained from a region of interest after source modeling the signal, are nevertheless influenced by highamplitude slow waves in other parts of the cortex. Indeed, source modeling strongly reduces but does not completely eliminate the effects of volume conduction. Moreover, regularization methods commonly applied to reduce the influence of noise in EEG data introduce a 'spatial smoothing' of the EEG sources. Finally, the effect of slow wave propagation, which occurs on a scale of tens/hundreds of milliseconds is not affected by source modeling approaches and may contribute to the relatively high level of low-frequency activity all over the cortical mantle and in brain areas that are not generating slow waves. Dream content in REM sleep We further investigated whether differences in high-frequency power could distinguish specific contents of DEs. For these analyses, we focused on REM sleep awakenings in trained subjects (experiment 2), because there were many intra-subject trials, reports were more detailed 9 and subjects were more confident about their answers concerning specific contents. Since dreams can differ greatly along the dimension 'perception vs. thought' 10 , subjects had been asked to rate their DEs accordingly. We found that high-frequency activity correlated with the thinking dimension in frontal brain regions and with the perceiving dimension in parietal, occipital and temporal areas (p<0.05 Fig. 4A ). This anterior-posterior gradient suggests that in dreams, just like in wakefulness, anterior cortical regions mediate thoughtlike experiences while posterior regions are involved in perceptual aspects of the experience. We also examined specific perceptual categories of dream reports. As shown in Fig. 4B , DEs containing faces, compared to DEs without faces, were associated with increased highfrequency activity in a circumscribed temporo-occipital region that closely matched the fusiform face area (FFA). A region of interest analysis (see Supplementary Methods) confirmed that high-frequency activity in the FFA on the right side was significantly higher for DEs containing faces (p=0.023, paired one-tailed t-test) compared to DEs without faces, consistent with the specialization of this area in the perception of faces during wakefulness. Subjects were also asked to determine whether the setting of the most recent DE was indoors, outdoors, or could not be specified. We found that DEs with a definite spatial setting were associated with increased high-frequency activity in the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) (Fig. 4C ), an area involved in spatial perception and visuo-spatial attention, whose lesion can cause spatial neglect. This finding was confirmed by a region of interest analysis (See Supplementary Methods, p=0.023, paired one-tailed t-test). Furthermore, DEs in which subjects reported the sense of moving in the dream were associated with increased high-frequency activity in a region surrounding the right superior temporal sulcus (Fig. 4C ), an area involved in the perception of biological motion and viewing body movements. A region of interest analysis confirmed this finding (See Supplementary Methods, p=0.029, paired one-tailed t-test). Finally, as shown in Fig. 4C , DEs containing speech were associated with increased high-frequency activity over a left posterior temporal region corresponding to Wernicke's area, as confirmed by a region of interest analysis (See Supplementary Methods, p=0.048, paired one-tailed t-test). It should be noted that an SnPM correction for multiple comparisons was not applied to whole-brain content-based analyses, because content-specific areas were expected to be highly spatially-restricted. Instead, region of interest analyses were used to confirm the specific hypotheses on the involvement of distinct content-related areas. Real-time prediction of dream experience in NREM sleep If a decrease in low-frequency EEG power and an increase in high-frequency power in a posterior hot zone represents a reliable neural correlate of dreaming, it should be possible to predict whether a person is dreaming or not in real time by detecting ongoing local EEG activations. Moreover, this should be the case even though the global EEG, as well as the local EEG in anterior areas, is characterized by slow wave activity typical of NREM sleep. To test this prediction, seven additional subjects slept for three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory while high-density EEG was continuously recorded. Based on the findings of Experiments 1 and 2, on the experimental (second and third) nights participants were awoken from NREM sleep when their neural activity surpassed a bispectral threshold in low-frequency (0.5-4.5 Hz) and high-frequency (18-25 Hz) band power from an electrode cluster over the posterior hot zone (Fig. 5A ; see Methods; the 18-25 Hz range was used because it captures EEG activations while avoiding artifacts from eye movements and other sources during online EEG monitoring). In total, participants were awakened 84 times (mean: 12.0 ± 3.4; Supplementary table S3 ). After removal of trials containing artifact (see Methods), there remained 36 awakenings initiated by the algorithm with a DE prediction, out of which 33 were accurate (DE mean accuracy = 91.6%, p=0.00001), and 26 awakenings with a NE prediction, out of which 21 were accurate (NE mean accuracy = 80.7%, p=0.0003); total prediction accuracy across all states was 87% (Fig. 5C ). No interaction was observed between DE prediction and time of night (F (1,6) =1. 35, p=0.29). Confirming significant differences in EEG power in DE compared to NE trials in the prediction ROI, we observed significantly lower low-frequency activity (p=0.001) in DE (10.17±2.5 [mean ± SD]) compared to NE (103.47±38.16) and significantly higher high-frequency activity (p=0.001) in DE (0.14±0.03) compared to NE (0.07±0.02) prediction trials (Fig. 5B , see also Supplementary Figure 6 ). DE had a higher high/low frequency band power ratio compared to NE (Supplementary Figure 7 ), especially in cortical regions including bilateral occipital cortex, precuneus, right superior parietal lobule (SPL), right precentral gyrus, left superior and middle temporal sulcus (STS), right lingual gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (p<0.001, FDR cluster corrected) (Fig. 5D and Supplementary table S4 ). Discussion The three experiments reported here highlight a parieto-occipital 'hot zone' as the neural correlate of dreaming. When this posterior hot zone showed a decrease in low-frequency EEG activity -traditionally known as 'EEG activation' 5, 6 -subjects reported upon awakening that they did have dream experiences. By contrast, when low-frequency EEG activity increased in the same area, subjects reported that they had been unconscious. This result held true whether the subjects had been in NREM sleep or in REM sleep, irrespective of the dominant EEG activity over other cortical regions. The influential notion that dreaming is virtually synonymous with REM sleep has dominated neuroimaging work for the past several decades 7 , despite the increasing number of studies suggesting that dream reports could be obtained from every stage of NREM sleep, albeit less often 18 . The frequent conflation of REM sleep with dreaming was eased by the marked similarities between the overall EEG of REM sleep and that of waking consciousness, and little attention was given to the rare reports of REM sleep awakenings that yielded no reports. Conversely, reports of dreaming from NREM sleep awakenings were hard to reconcile with EEG patterns characterized by slow wave activity -the opposite of EEG activation 5 . Indeed, it was suggested that reports of dreaming after NREM awakenings were due to 'covert' REM sleep 19 , or even that neural activity in the cortex was unrelated to the presence or absence of consciousness 20 . The present results resolve these paradoxes by showing that in both REM and NREM sleep, dreaming, and more generally, conscious experience during sleep, requires a localized activation of a posterior hot zone, irrespective of the EEG in the rest of the cortex. This explains why dreaming can occur in two behavioral states that differ radically in terms of global EEG signatures. Of course, since the posterior hot zone was highlighted by averaging EEG recordings preceding many awakenings from many subjects, the full neural correlates of experiences in sleep could occasionally include additional brain regions. For example, dreams that include insight into the state (so-called lucid dreams) or dreams in which an individual has some degree of control over the content of the dream may recruit additional areas of frontalparietal cortex 21, 22 . Also, when considering unthresholded t-maps (Supplementary Figure 8 ), it is apparent that some cortical areas that do not reach significance in the contrast between DE and NE are nevertheless consistently and smoothly highlighted in both experiments 1 and 2. These areas include superior temporal and postcentral regions, as well the midcingulate region, which is also highlighted by contrasts between highly thought-like and highly perceptual experiences in REM sleep (Figure 4A ). Conversely, we cannot rule out that the posterior hot zone may include, besides brain regions supporting experiences, areas that might support unconscious aspects of dream generation. However, many studies contrasting perceiving or not specific sensory stimuli during wakefulness (such as seeing/not seeing a face, an object, a place, a movement, and so on) also point to regions within the posterior hot zone 23 . EEG source modeling indicates that, in addition to low and high-level sensory areas (primarily visual), the posterior hot zone prominently includes precuneus, posterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices: areas on the medial surface of the brain whose electrical stimulation can induce a feeling of being 'in a parallel world' 24 , disconnected from the environment in a 'dream-like state' 25 , and whose involvement in multisensory integration is well-suited to support the virtual simulation of a world 26 and the 'immersive spatio-temporal hallucinations' 27 that characterize dreams. The posterior hot zone was also highlighted by the contrast between the absence of experiences and experiences without recall of specific contents of the experience. This finding further suggests that the activation of this posterior hot zone is a marker of experiences themselves, rather than of the recall of experiences. The trustworthiness of subjective dream reports has often been called into question and has generated much controversy in the past. Indeed, it is particularly delicate to distinguish the absence of experience from forgotten experiences in this context. Therefore, to reduce potential biases associated with collecting reports, we followed standardized experimental protocols. Specifically, to avoid interfering with dream recall or introducing variability in dream recall, subjects were always interviewed just after being awakened from a dream (short temporal lag) and in identical experimental conditions (lying on their back, with eyes closed, without the examiner entering the room). In addition, in experiment 2 subjects were trained in dream reporting so as not to introduce a 'learning bias' in recalling dream experiences. Our results, which show, for the first time, that reports of absent and forgotten dream experiences carry distinct EEG signatures, should encourage the current tendency to take subjective reports of conscious experience at face value, i.e. as the best inference to scientific explanation, provided that carefully designed experimental protocols are used 27 . In line with our results, both lesion studies and neuroimaging results indicate that specific contents of experiences are supported by posterior cortical areas 28 , while a different set of brain areas are involved in encoding and storing memories and in directing attention 29 . The results we obtained were also virtually identical in naïve subjects (Experiment 1) and in trained subjects (Experiment 2), suggesting that they characterize a core correlate of dream experience, rather than some other cognitive function. In our experiments conscious experiences were consistently associated with low activity in the delta range (1-4 Hz) and the absence of experience with high delta activity in the posterior hot zone. During NREM sleep, EEG slow waves in the delta range reflect alternations between periods of depolarization (up-states), during which neurons can fire, and periods of hyperpolarization (down-states) during which neurons cease firing 11 . This bistability of membrane potential causes the breakdown of stable causal interactions among cortical areas 12 , which are thought to be necessary for sustaining conscious experiences 13, 14 . Recently, the occurrence of local slow waves has also been discovered during REM sleep, especially in the supragranular layers of primary cortical areas 30 , adding to the evidence that neuronal activity during sleep can have a local component 11 . A global slowing of EEG activity into the delta range had been associated with loss of consciousness in many previous studies 13, 14, 31, 32 . However, there are several situations in which subjects can be conscious and have experiences despite the presence of local and global slow wave activity 23, 33, 34 , including of course NREM sleep itself, where global slow wave activity is present despite the frequent occurrence of dreaming. The present findings suggest that future work in patients with disorders of consciousness, epileptic seizures, or under general anesthesia should examine the level of EEG activation in the posterior hot zone to uncover the possible occurrence of consciousness despite the loss of responsiveness. In addition to differences in EEG low-frequency activity in the posterior hot zone, we found that this region also showed increased high-frequency activity when subjects reported dreaming experiences during sleep. High-frequency activity usually reflects increased neuronal firing 16 . A plausible interpretation of this finding is that, as long as the posterior hot zone is not in a low-frequency mode that prevents experiences, the specific contents of experiences when dreaming are dictated by which specific groups of neurons fire strongly and which do not, just as in wake. Consistent with this, we found that specific contents of a subject's REM sleep dream -such as thoughts, perceptions, faces, places, movement, and speech -are associated with increased high-frequency EEG activity in specific cortical areas, which correspond closely to those engaged during waking perception of the same contents. Although these differences extended only over a few voxels and were statistically weaker than the contrasts between DE and NE, their temporal distribution (maximal in the two seconds before the awakening), and spatial localization (similar to waking perception of the same contents) strongly support our interpretation. In a recent fMRI study, a pattern classifier trained while subjects perceived natural images during wakefulness 35 was able to successfully decode specific content categories reported by subjects awakened at the transition between wakefulness and sleep. Our results with high-density EEG extend these findings beyond falling asleep to periods of consolidated sleep, providing further evidence that dream reports reflect conscious experience during sleep rather than confabulations upon awakening 36, 37 . Increased high-frequency activity associated with reports of dreaming experiences were also observed in areas that went beyond the posterior hot zone. Thus, increased high-frequency activity extended to some portions of prefrontal cortex during REM sleep dreaming, especially for thought-like experiences. Moreover, a frontal cluster (Fig 3B ) showed increase high-frequency activity during NREM sleep when contrasting experiences with and without recall of content, suggesting that this area may be important for recall of the content of the experience. Neuronal activity in the gamma range was initially linked to consciousness, but later studies showed that consciousness and gamma activity can be dissociated 23 . For example, one can be aware of a stimulus whether or not it triggers gamma activity 38 , and gamma activity can be strong during general anesthesia in the presence of low frequency oscillations 39 . However, recent studies have reported that gamma-band transcranial alternating current stimulation is associated with higher scores on the revised coma scale recovery scale (CRS-R) 40 or self-awareness during REM sleep dreams 41 , suggesting that high-frequency activity may indeed influence functions related to cognition or awareness. It is thus an open question whether high-frequency activity in a subset of prefrontal regions may contribute some specific contents to experience 23 , such as conscious thought or mindwandering states 42 , emotional/motivational contents 43 , metacognition 44 , or insight into one's state (i.e., lucid dreaming) 21, 22 . Alternatively, high-frequency activity in prefrontal regions may mediate cognitive functions that are unconscious but affect experience indirectly, such as the encoding and storing of long-term memories, the deployment of attention, and the planning and execution of tasks. Finally, this study suggests that dreaming may constitute a valuable model for the study of consciousness with implications beyond sleep. First, the direct comparison between consciousness (the presence of experience) and unconsciousness (the absence of experience) within the same behavioral state avoids confounds that limit the interpretation of betweenstates paradigms. These confounds arise because, in studies contrasting wakefulness with sleep, anesthesia, or coma, many other aspects of brain function besides consciousness change along with behavioral state changes 45 . Second, during sleep subjects are largely disconnected from the environment on both the input and output side, meaning that in the majority of cases, sensory stimuli do not influence the content of experience 2 . Third, during sleep subjects are not performing an experimental task, avoiding confounds caused by stimulus processing, response preparation, and execution 45 . An influential notion derived from neuroimaging studies contrasting wake with NREM sleep, anesthesia, or coma is that the neural correlates of consciousness would correspond to a broad fronto-parietal network 46 . This notion has been reinforced by findings indicating that the same fronto-parietal network is activated when contrasting brain responses to the same stimuli when subjects reported seeing them or not 47 . However, lesion studies suggest that consciousness persists after widespread frontal lesions 23, 48 and recent work controlling for confounding factors related to stimulus processing, attention, and task performance have cast doubt on a central role of this fronto-parietal network in supporting consciousness 23, 49, 50 . By exploiting a within state, no stimulus, no task paradigm, our findings indicate that the neural correlate of consciousness, rather than involving the broad lateral fronto-parietal network, is restricted to a posterior hot zone. Methods Experiments 1 and 2 Procedure-The procedure used in this study has been described in detail in a previous publication 9 . Awakenings in the sleep laboratory were performed at pseudorandom intervals, irrespective of sleep stage, using a computerized sound that lasted 1.5 sec, which was administered through E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). Subjects were instructed to signal that they had heard the alarm sound and to lie quietly on their back. They then underwent a structured interview via intercom about their mental activity that lasted between 20 sec and 3.5 min, depending on whether the subject reported a conscious experience and had to answer additional questions related to the content. Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants before the experiment, and ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of Wisconsin -Madison Institutional Review Board. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Study participants experiment 1-Thirty-two healthy subjects (12 males, age 46 ± 13.3 years, 24-65 [mean ± SD, range]), selected from a group of 69 subjects participating in a larger research project in our laboratory, were included in this experiment. Subjects were randomly selected from the subset of all participants that had at least one DE and NE report in NREM sleep during the same night. Among the 240 awakenings performed in these 32 subjects, 5 had to be excluded for technical problems and 2 because subjects were too somnolent upon awakening to answer questions reliably. Comparisons between DEWR-NE conditions and DE-DEWR conditions were performed in the subset of these participants (N=20) that had all three types (DE, DEWR, NE) of report during the same night. In REM sleep, only 6 out of the 69 participants presented both DE and NE. They were all included in the analysis. Study participants experiment 2-Seven healthy subjects were included in this experiment (3 males, age 31 ± 8.8 years, 21-47 [mean ± SD, range]). None of the subjects in this experiment participated in experiments 1 or 3. The behavioral results of 6 of these 7 subjects (i.e., dream recall rates and characteristics of dreams across sleep stages), but not the EEG results, have been described in a previous publication 9 . Data from experiments 1 and 3 has not been reported previously. Study participants received comprehensive explanations regarding the questionnaire used in the experiment, and filled it in at home every morning upon awakening for two weeks before the first study night. During this training phase experimenters communicated repeatedly with the subjects to ensure that they were proceeding with the training and to answer any questions the subjects had regarding the questionnaire. Between five and ten overnight recordings were performed for each participant, with a maximum of three consecutive nights. To increase the number of awakenings in REM sleep with respect to NREM sleep, two additional nights were scheduled for three of the subjects, in which awakenings were only performed in REM sleep. The total number of nights was distributed as follows among subjects: S1:10 nights, S2:8 nights, S3:6 nights, S4:5 nights, S5:8 nights, S6:6 nights, S7:8 nights. Overall, 836 awakenings were performed, of which 5 had to be excluded because of technical problems, and 16 because subjects were too somnolent upon awakening to answer questions reliably. Sleep recordings-Recordings were made at the Wisconsin Center for Sleep and Consciousness. They were performed using a 256-channel high-density EEG (hd-EEG) system (Electrical Geodesics, Inc., Eugene, Ore.). Four of the 256 electrodes placed at the outer canthi of the eyes were used to monitor eye movements; additional polysomnography channels were used to record submental electromyography. Sleep scoring was performed over 30s epochs according to standard criteria 51 . Preprocessing of data experiment 1-The signal corresponding to the 2 min preceding each awakening was extracted and considered for analysis. The EEG signal was sampled at 500 Hz and off-line band-pass filtered between 1 and 50 Hz for the NREM data and between 0.3 and 50 Hz for the REM data, in order to be merged with the REM data of Experiment 2. The NREM EEG data was high-pass filtered at 1Hz instead of lower frequencies, as there were strong sweating artifacts in some of the participants that caused intermittent high-amplitude slow frequency oscillatory activity around 0.3 Hz. REM data did not contain any sweating artifacts and was high-pass filtered at 0.3Hz. Channels containing artifacts were visually identified and replaced with data interpolated from nearby channels using spherical splines (NetStation, Electrical Geodesic Inc.). To remove ocular, muscular, and electrocardiograph artifacts we performed Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using EEGLAB routines 52 . Only ICA components with specific activity patterns and component maps characteristic of artifacts were removed 53 . Preprocessing of data experiment 2-The signal corresponding to the 2 min preceding each awakening was extracted and considered for analysis. The EEG signal was sampled at 500 Hz and off-line band-pass filtered between 0.3 and 50 Hz for both NREM and REM data. Artifact removal was carried out as in experiment 1. Signal analysis Source localization: The previously cleaned, filtered and average-referenced EEG signal corresponding to the 20s before the awakening was extracted and analyzed at the source level. Source modelling was performed using the GeoSource software (Electrical Geodesics, Inc., Eugene, Ore.). A 4-shell head model based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas and a standard coregistered set of electrode positions were used to construct the forward model. The source space was restricted to 2447 dipoles that were distributed over 7×7×7 mm cortical voxels. The inverse matrix was computed using the standardized lowresolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) constraint 54 . A Tikhonov regularization procedure was applied to account for the variability in the signal-to-noise ratio 54 . We computed spectral power density using the Welch's modified periodogram method (implemented with the pwelch function in MATLAB; The Math Works Inc, Natick, MA) in 2s Hamming windows (8 segments, 50% overlap) to decompose the source signals into frequency bands of interest. Statistical Analysis: No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes were similar to those reported in previous studies, in which sleep was assessed using high-density EEG recordings 55, 56 . As within-subject contrasts were carried out, no randomization in the organization of the experimental conditions was performed. Statistical analyses were carried out in MATLAB. Statistical analyses and thresholds were selected based on 1) the statistical power of the contrast and 2) the strength of the a priori hypothesis. To compare brain activity between DE and NE, the source-modeled signal was averaged within the time periods and frequency bands of interest. We then averaged the signal associated with DEs and NEs within each subject and for each frequency band and stage (REM and NREM sleep) separately. Whole-brain group level analyses on average absolute power values were performed separately for each frequency range. Due to the nature of high-density EEG, differences were expected to extend over a relatively large number of voxels. For this reason, a statistical analysis with a cluster-based correction for multiple comparisons was used (Statistical nonparametric mapping, SnPM) 57 and a two-tailed t-test with a corrected p<0.05 threshold was applied. For analyses of content (faces, spatial setting, movement, speech), we used a more liberal threshold (p<0.05, uncorrected, two-tailed paired t-tests), given that activations were expected in restricted cortical regions, comprising only a few voxels. We first verified that the data were normally distributed using the Lilliefors modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p>0.05, t(5) < 2.57 and t(6) < 2.45, depending on the number subjects included in each contrast). For all planned comparisons (face, setting, movement, speech), a normal distribution was confirmed for the large majority of voxels (range 81.2-95.0%). Given the relative robustness of parametric t-tests to violations of normality, and the relatively small percentage of voxels breaking this assumption, potential differences were assessed using two-tailed paired t-tests (p<0.05). Additional region of interest (ROI) based analyses were performed as follows: ROIs were defined as 15mm radius spheres centered on coordinates (ex. fusiform face area) obtained from previous imaging studies [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Then, high-frequency power values (20-50 Hz) were averaged within these ROIs and compared between conditions (i.e., face vs. no face). Given the strong a priori hypothesis about the direction of the contrast (based on the results of the previous analysis), one-sided paired t-tests were used for these analyses. Larger ROIs (25mm spheres) were used for the figures (Fig. 4 ) for better visibility. In the figures we opted for displaying both the p<0.05 and the p<0.1 significance level, to show that the activations are spatially smooth, as opposed to random, and thus more likely to correspond to neural activations. Since experience-related brain activity for the content of experiences was assumed to be very short-lived and subjects were specifically instructed to refer to the 'very last' experience before the alarm sound when reporting the presence of specific contents, we considered shorter timeframes before the awakening when performing contentspecific contrasts, ranging from 0 to -8s with respect to the awakening. To investigate the correlation between the thinking/perceiving score and high frequency power (25-50 Hz), we calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for each subject and voxel, and then averaged the resulting coefficients across subjects to obtain group-level correlation maps (Fig. 4 ). Statistical significance was determined using a permutation-based approach. Specifically, null distributions were generated for each voxel by randomly shuffling the two variables of interest (thinking/perceiving score and high-frequency power) in each subject and recalculating the group-level mean correlation (n=1000). A voxel-wise parametric one-sided t test was subsequently performed (p < 0.05). Selection of frequency bands: For low frequency power comparisons, we selected the 1-4 Hz band, as this frequency range is associated with the presence of slow waves, which have been linked to the loss of consciousness. Slow oscillations have been shown to exist not only in NREM sleep, but also in in REM sleep 30 . For high-frequency power comparisons, a slightly lower frequency range (20-50 Hz) was chosen for NREM sleep compared to REM sleep (25-50 Hz), given that NREM sleep is typically characterized by slower frequencies 64 . Frequencies above 50 Hz were not included in order to avoid muscle and powerline artifacts. Frequencies below 20 Hz were avoided because of the potential overlap with fast sleep spindles, which can reach 18 Hz 65, 66 . Hemispheric lateralization: To assess lateralization of findings, for each contrast we evaluated the potential difference in the number of voxels showing a significant effect between the two hemispheres by calculating a lateralization index (LI) as described in 67 . To test for a statistically significant difference between the level of activity observed in symmetrical areas across the two hemispheres, we calculated the relative difference in power spectral density (PSD) between two symmetrical ROIs including the voxels that showed a significant effect in the hemisphere characterized by the stronger LI, but not in the contralateral side. In particular, we explored the potential interaction between hemisphere (Left, Right) and type of report (DE, NDE, DEWR) using a repeated measure ANOVA. Experiment 3 Study Participants Experiment 3-Seven additional participants (4 men, 3 women; age 22 ± 4 years, 19-31 years [mean ± SD, range]) not included in Experiments 1 or 2 were recruited for Experiment 3. All participants were right-handed and had no history of neurological disorder. Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants before the experiment, and ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Board. Sleep Recordings-Hd-EEG was continuously recorded overnight using a 64-electrode EEG cap (EasyCap, Herrsching, Germany) with equidistantly spaced sintered Ag/AgCl ring electrodes. The signal was amplified using BrainAmp MR Plus amplifiers (16-bit analog-todigital conversion; 0.5-μV resolution; ±16.384-mV operating range; 5,000-Hz sampling; 0.1to 250-Hz band pass) (Brain Products, Munich, Germany) and transmitted via fiber-optic cables. Data recording during the baseline night was made with BrainVision Recorder (v. 1.20) software while experimental nights data was readout in real-time, filtered (0.5-58 Hz), and relayed to custom MATLAB scripts for online EEG power analysis using OpenVibe software 68 . EEG was digitized at an online sampling rate of 500 Hz and was referenced to the vertex. Electrode impedances were kept below 20 kΩ. EEG Data Processing-Offline EEG data analysis was conducted with MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) using the EEGLAB toolbox 52 and custom scripts. Sleep recordings were re-staged offline according to standard criteria to verify online sleep staging 51 . EEG data was epoched at 60 seconds prior to each awakening, consistent with the time interval used for prediction (see Procedure). Twenty epochs were removed from analysis due to the presence of EEG artifacts or because sleep stage could not be confirmed. Data were bandpass filtered between 0.5 and 58 Hz using a Hamming windowed sinc FIR filter. Bad channels were identified by visual inspection and interpolated using spherical splines. Spectral power density was computed using Welch's modified periodogram method. Source localization was performed in Brainstorm 69 with a noise-normalized estimate using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA 54 ). Group-level analysis on EEG sources was conducted using the GLM framework implemented in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London). Whole-cortex analyses were conducted and correction for multiple comparisons was performed using topological FDR 70 (cluster forming threshold of P = 0.0005; cluster size threshold of P < 0.001; k = 100 vertices). Procedure-Participants were invited to spend three consecutive nights in the lab. During the first night (baseline) they were allowed to sleep without interruption. Individual thresholds for low-frequency (1-4 Hz) and high-frequency (18-25 Hz) band power were computed from baseline night recordings by binning all NREM sleep into 60s epochs and computing the top and bottom 15% thresholds from the distribution for each band for each participant over the entire baseline night (Fig. 5A , middle panel). 18-25 Hz power was used for the high frequency power range of interest because higher frequencies are more prone to artifact from eye movements and other sources 71, 72 and applying ICA for artifact removal to data in an online fashion was technically challenging. On the experimental (second and third) nights, participants were awoken from NREM (sleep stage 2 or 3) when their neural activity surpassed a bispectral threshold in low-and high-frequency band power from an electrode cluster centered over the posterior hot zone. To ensure a stable sleep stage had been reached, participants were required to be in NREM for a minimum of 120 seconds before the algorithm initiated an awakening. The bispectral threshold required that for an DE prediction to be initiated low-frequency power had to be less than or equal to the lower 15% threshold while high-frequency power had to simultaneously meet the top 15% threshold for that subject. Likewise, for a NE prediction to be initiated low-frequency power had to be greater than or equal to the top 15% threshold while high-frequency power had to simultaneously be less than or equal to the bottom 15% threshold for that subject. This procedure was motivated by the results of experiments 1 and 2, and aimed to predict the presence of DE during time epochs in which the cortex was not only not bistable but also displayed correlates of neural firing (and vice versa for predictions of NE 13, 16 ). Upon awakening participants completed a short version of the sleep questionnaire used in experiments 1 and 2. The post-hoc statistical analyses were performed to confirm the posterior maximum of the low-frequency/high-frequency differences. Because extreme ratios were compared, statistical differences were expected to be much stronger in this experiment than in experiments 1 and 2. For this reason, a more stringent threshold was used (p<0.001, FDR cluster corrected). This analysis confirmed the posterior maximum of the low-frequency/ high-frequency differences. For an analysis with SnPM correction with the same threshold than in experiments 1 and 2, see Supplementary Figure 7 . Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Introduction Sensory information acquires meaning to adaptively guide our essential behaviors. Both cortical and subcortical structures are believed to work together to assign valence to stimuli (Berridge and Aldridge, 2008; Gottfried, 2009; Veldhuizen et al., 2009; Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010; Kumar et al., 2012; Chikazoe et al., 2014) ; however, major questions remain regarding the circuitry underlying this important task. Odors guide a number of vital behaviors, such as nutritional selection and threat avoidance (Doty, 1986; Slotnick, 2001) . Both the olfactory bulb (Pager, 1974; Karpov, 1980; Wilson et al., 1987; Kay and Laurent, 1999; Doucette et al., 2011) and piriform cortex (Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995; Litaudon et al., 1997; Cohen et al., 2008; Gottfried, 2010; Wilson and Sullivan, 2011; Gire et al., 2013) possess the capacity to code for odors based upon their associative properties. The fact that odor information from the olfactory bulb is directly distributed to multiple secondary olfactory structures in addition to the piriform cortex (Shipley and Adamek, 1984; Scott, 1986) suggests that the olfactory system may use parallel pathways for encoding odor meaning. We predicted that the olfactory tubercle (OT) participates in the coding of odor valence. The OT is a component of both the olfactory and reward systems (de Olmos and Heimer, 1999) . Olfactory information is conveyed to the OT through a number of pathways, including monosynaptic input from the olfactory bulb and inputs from other olfactory cortical areas, as well as the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (Wesson and Wilson, 2011) . In anesthetized animals, OT neurons readily encode odor information and are modulated by multisensory inputs (Murakami et al., 2005; Wesson and Wilson, 2010; Payton et al., 2012; Rampin et al., 2012) . State-dependent influences also modulate cellular and network-level activity of the OT in awake rodents (Carlson et al., 2014; Narikiyo et al., 2014) and in humans (Zelano et al., 2005) . No description of cellular-level odor coding in the OTs of awake animals is available. The OT is also a part of the ventral striatum reward circuitry that connects limbic and basal ganglia systems to facilitate behavioral learning (Mogenson et al., 1980; Cardinal et al., 2002; Ikemoto, 2007; van der Meer and Redish, 2011) . Indeed, the OT possesses dense reciprocal connectivity with the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, and multiple amygdaloid nuclei, as well as outputs to basal ganglia including the caudate-putamen (for review, see Wesson and Wilson, 2011) . Further, the OT has established roles in driving reward-directed motivated behaviors (Prado-Alcala ´and Wise, 1984; Ikemoto, 2003; Ikemoto et al., 2005) . Thus, based upon both functional and anatomical data, there are two seemingly distinct theories for the role of the OT-one for sensory processing, especially olfaction, and one for motivated behaviors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that OT neurons code the associated outcome of odors (rewarded or not), which has the potential to unite these two views. We find that the firing rate of OT neurons robustly and flexibly encodes the learned valence of odors in a manner that may be important for guiding instrumental behavior. Materials and Methods Animals. C57BL/6 male mice (n ϭ 18, 2-4 months of age) originating from Harlan Laboratories were bred and maintained within the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine animal facility. Two animals did not contribute data since one did not yield well isolated neurons and the other did not reach criterion behavioral performance levels. Mice were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum, except when water was restricted for behavioral training (see below). Up to five mice were cohoused in a cage before experimentation, but all postsurgical animals were housed individually. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care Committee. Surgical procedures. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2-4% in oxygen; Abbott Laboratories) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame with a water-filled heating pad (38°C) beneath to maintain body temperature. Anesthesia depth was verified by the absence of the toepinch reflex. An injection of a local anesthetic (1% lidocaine, 0.05 ml, s.c.) was administered into the wound margin site before exposing the dorsal skull. A craniotomy was made to access the OT (ϩ2.0 mm from bregma, ϩ1.0 mm lateral; Fig. 1 ). An eight-channel tungsten electrode array was implanted within the OT (4.9 mm ventral) and cemented in place, along with a headbar for later head fixation. A second craniotomy was made over the contralateral cortex for placement of a ground wire. To access respiratory transients (Wesson et al., 2008) , a small hole was drilled into the ipsilateral nasal bone, 1 mm anterior to the frontal nasal fissure. The nasal epithelium was pierced, and a small stainless steel cannula (part #C313G, PlasticsOne) was secured in place. During a 3 d recovery period, animals received a daily injection of carprofen (5 mg/kg, s.c.; Pfizer Animal Health) and ad libitum access to food and water. Behavioral task. Mice were water restricted for 3 d before behavioral training. Body weight was monitored daily and maintained at 85% of their original weight. Mice were trained in cohorts of three. All behavioral procedures were performed during the light hours. Head-fixed mice were trained on a lick/no-lick odor discrimination task across multiple 1 h recording sessions in which the mice obtained a 4 l water reward for licking a spout positioned in front of their snouts in trials with reinforced odors (Fig. 2A-C ; Verhagen et al., 2007) . Licking was measured by a pair of infrared photobeams positioned to cross in front of the lick spout by ϳ2 mm. Mice were first trained to lick the water spout for reward (Phase 1) and then were rewarded for licking only during odor presentation (Phase 2, always rewarded odor trials), with a progressively increasing intertrial interval. In Phase 3, trials were randomized between rewarded and unrewarded trials; for unrewarded odor trials, mice were presented with a "blank" stimulus (mineral oil) and had to learn to withhold licking during these trials. Finally, in Phase 4, trials were randomized between the rewarded and unrewarded odor as in the experimental sessions. In go trials, mice would receive a reward for licking a spout during the rewarded odor (hit), otherwise the trial would be considered a miss. In no-go trials, mice were presented with an unreinforced odor and did not receive a water reward regardless of whether they licked (false alarm) or correctly withheld licking for the total odor duration of the trial (correct reject). Behavioral performance was evaluated in blocks of 20 trials, and mice were required to achieve a performance criterion of Ն85% correct for two consecutive blocks to advance to the next phase (Fig. 2C ; Verhagen et al., 2007) . OT activity was recorded throughout all training phases, but analysis of odor-evoked activity was restricted to post-training sessions. On separate experimental days, mice were evaluated under three different behavioral tasks, in the following order: odor discrimination, binary odor mixture discrimination, and reversal learning. For odor discrimination sessions (n ϭ 52 sessions total), 16 mice had extensive training with an odor pair, as evidenced by high behavioral performance (Ն80% correct). One mouse did not yield any well isolated neurons during this task. Analyses for this task type included responses to the original odor pair used during the training phases, as well as novel odor pairs that were learned in a later session (see below). In binary odor mixture discrimination sessions (n ϭ 25 sessions total), task difficulty was increased for 13 mice by using binary mixtures of the rewarded and unrewarded odors (Uchida and Mainen, 2003; Abraham et al., 2004) . The first cohort of mice (n ϭ 3) did not participate in a binary odor mixture discrimination task. Binary mixtures were presented at ratios of 80% rewarded to 20% unrewarded (in the liquid state). One mouse did not reach adequate behavioral performance levels in the mixture discrimination task. For reversal learning sessions (n ϭ 17 sessions total), 16 mice were presented with the original odor discrimination pair for two blocks, after which the odor contingencies were reversed and successful reversal learning was acquired within the same day. Two mice did not yield well isolated neurons during the reversal learning task, and a third mouse did not reach criterion behavioral performance levels. After completing all tasks, eight mice were trained on additional novel odor discriminations followed by reversal learning to increase the yield of unique neuron-odor pairings (maximum of three unique odor pairings per Figure 1 . Electrode tip locations within the OT. Coronal panels show the approximate location of electrode tips following histological verification (red ellipses, n ϭ 16 separate implants). All recordings had electrode tips confirmed within the OT, with the majority of tips localized within the anterior portion of the OT. The extent of the OT is indicated by gray shading. Placement within a specific layer of the OT could not be resolved. Sections span from 1.0 to 2.0 mm anterior of bregma (gray line), in 0.5 mm intervals. Panels are adapted from Paxinos and Franklin (2000) . mouse). Overall, one to eight sessions per mouse were performed for the original discrimination task, and one to three sessions per mouse for the binary mixture and reversal tasks. Stimulus delivery. Odors were presented through a custom air dilution olfactometer with independent stimulus lines up to the point of entry into the odor port. In addition to a blank stimulus (mineral oil), odors included isopentyl acetate, ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, heptanal, (Ϫ)-limonene, 2-heptanone, 2-butanone, and 1,7-octadiene (Sigma-Aldrich; all Ͼ97% purity). These molecularly diverse odors were diluted in their liquid state to 1 torr (133.32 Pa) in mineral oil and were then further diluted to 10% (v/v) by mixing 100 ml of odor vaporized N 2 with 900 ml of medical grade N 2 (Airgas). Thus, stimuli were delivered at a total flow rate of 1 L/min. Not all animals were tested with all odors. The rewarded and unrewarded odor pairs were pseudo-randomly assigned to each cohort before training (neurons were not initially screened for odor responsiveness). The experimenter was not blind to odor assignment, but all stimulus presentation was automated. Rewarded and unrewarded odors were pseudo-randomized within each block, and presented for 2 s duration with a 25 Ϯ 2 s intertrial interval through a Teflon odor port (9-mm-diameter opening) directed toward the snout of the animal at a distance of 1 cm. Odor was continuously flowing to the odor port but was removed by a vacuum before exiting toward the animal. Recordings with a photoionization detector (PID; miniPID, Aurora Scientific) were used to confirm the temporal dynamics of the odor presentation in this design. When a single test stimulus (1,7-octadiene, diluted and presented as described above) was presented eight times, the average evoked PID response reached 10% and 50% of maximum response at ϳ110 and 120 ms, respectively, relative to vacuum offset (odor onset; Fig. 2B ). The intensity of the odor was relatively stable throughout the duration of the 2 s presentation (Ϯ3% of the mean). Further, odor removal was rapid, with a prompt return of the PID response to Ͻ10% of the maximum response following vacuum onset (odor offset). While these dynamics may vary slightly across odors, these measures illustrate the precision and stability of the odor presentation methods used in this study. In vivo electrophysiology. The output of the electrode array was amplified, digitized at 24.4 kHz, filtered (bandpass filter, 300 -5000 Hz), and monitored (Tucker-Davis Technologies), along with respiration (bandpass filter, 1-10 Hz; 100 Hz sampling rate), licking (300 Hz sampling rate), and odor presentation events. One electrode wire was selected to serve as a local reference. To aid behavioral shaping, sniffing was monitored in eight animals by recording intranasal pressure by connecting the implanted nasal cannula to a pressure sensor (Honeywell) via polyethylene tubing (Wesson et al., 2008) . No attempt was made to analyze data relative to the respiratory cycle among these animals due to a limited number of experimental sessions with a robust sniffing signal. Given the small dorsal-ventral extent of the OT (ϳ300 m), our electrode arrays were fixed in place, and no attempt was made to record from unique populations of neurons on different sessions. Indeed, it is possible that the same neuron was recorded across multiple days. To compensate for this potential bias, the three different behavioral tasks and/or novel odor pairs were used, and statistical comparisons were made only within each task type. Sessions of the same task and odor pair were run for 1-3 consecutive days to achieve adequate behavioral performance and/or capture the dynamics of newly identified neurons. Examination of the average spike waveform confirmed that 89% of the analyzed neurons represent a unique neuron-odor pair. On average, 3.1 Ϯ 1.4 single neurons were recorded per mouse per session (range, one to seven neurons), with an average of 2.2 Ϯ 1.6 neurons recorded per viable electrode wire per mouse per session. After all recording sessions were completed (between 10 and 30 d), mice were given (intraperitoneally) an overdose of urethane and were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline and 10% formalin, and brains stored in 30% sucrose formalin at 4°C. OT recording sites were verified by histological examinations of slide-mounted, 40 m coronal sections stained with a 1% cresyl violet solution (Fig. 1 ). Analysis of odor-evoked activity. Single neurons were sorted off-line in Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design), using a combination of template matching and cluster cutting based on principal component analysis. Single neurons were further defined as having Ͻ2% of the spikes occurring within a refractory period of 2 ms. Spike times associated with each odor were extracted and exported to MATLAB (MathWorks) for further analysis. To examine modulations in firing rate within a single trial, spike density functions were calculated by convolving spike trains with a function resembling a postsynaptic potential (Thompson et al., 1996) . Mean firing rates across trials were measured in 50 ms bins, along with the 95% confidence intervals. The mean baseline firing rate for each neuron was averaged across the 2 s before odor onset. Neurons were considered task-responsive if two consecutive bins within a 7 s period from odor onset were significantly different from the baseline rate, having nonoverlapping confidence intervals. This liberal 7 s window size was chosen to capture any modulation in firing rate that may be related to odor presentation, licking behavior, and/or reward ingestion. Notably, our results are not dependent on the size of this window. Indeed, almost all responsive neurons in the odor discrimination task (164 of 165 neurons) are also task responsive within a 2 s period from odor onset. Animals were typically presented with 40 trials of a single rewarded and unrewarded odor set per session. To ensure that animals were attending to the task, only blocks possessing high behavioral performance were analyzed for odor discrimination and reversal learning sessions. For the binary odor mixture discrimination task, all blocks were analyzed regardless of performance due to the increased task difficulty and the need for comparing correct and error trials. All performed tests were two sided and met assumptions of normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Sample sizes are consistent with numbers reported in the field, and no statistical method was used to predetermine these. Statistical analyses were performed in StatView (SAS Institute) or MATLAB. All data are reported as the mean Ϯ SEM, unless otherwise noted. Receiver operating characteristic analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) is a nonparametric measure of the discriminability of two distributions (Green and Swets, 1966) . To normalize peristimulus time histograms across neurons, we used an auROC method that quantifies stimulusrelated changes in firing rate to the baseline activity on a 0 -1 scale (for more details, see Cohen et al., 2012) . A value of 0.5 indicates completely overlapping distributions, whereas values of 0 or 1 signal perfect discriminability. Using a sliding ROC analysis, we calculated the auROC at each time bin (window size 50 ms, advanced in 10 ms steps) over a 7 s period from stimulus onset. Values Ͼ0.5 indicate the probability that firing rates were increased relative to baseline, whereas values Ͻ0.5 indicate the probability that firing rates were decreased relative to baseline. The firing rate distributions of correct trials typically contained 20 -40 trials per odor (range, 7-61), except for error trial distributions, which required a minimum of only 5 trials and typically contained 6 -25 trials (range, 5-48). Similar trial numbers have been used for calculating auROC (Veit and Nieder, 2013) . To evaluate odor selectivity, auROC was used to measure the discriminability of the firing rate distributions of the rewarded and unrewarded odor (the unrewarded odor was set as the reference distribution). In this case, values Ͼ0.5 indicate increases in firing for the rewarded odor relative to unrewarded odor ("rewarded odor preference"), whereas values Ͻ0.5 indicated higher firing rates for the unrewarded odor ("unrewarded odor preference"). A permutation test was used to create a null distribution of auROC values ϳ0.5, where the trial labels "rewarded" and "unrewarded' were randomly reassigned and calculated 1000 times. Significant auROC bins were determined by testing whether the actual auROC value was outside the 95% confidence interval of this null distribution (Veit and Nieder, 2013) . A neuron was considered "odor selective" (increased firing rates for one odor over the other) if there were at least two consecutive significant auROC bins from odor onset to the average be-havioral response within the session, which was defined as 75 ms before the recorded lick onset to adjust for motor responses leading up to lick detection. Odor-selective neurons that preferentially fired in response to the rewarded odor had significant auROC values (Ͼ0.5), whereas neu- rons preferentially firing for the unrewarded odor had significant auROC values (Ͻ0.5). The same procedure was used for determining trial response selectivity, except in those cases where firing rate distributions were defined by the behavioral response and required the following three comparisons: hit versus correct reject, false alarm versus correct reject, and hit versus false alarm. Population auROC odor comparisons were made by first averaging values across a 200 ms window before average lick onset for each neuron, and then running a paired t test. To test the strength of discriminability, auROC magnitudes before lick onset for all task-responsive neurons were assessed by first subtracting the auROC value for neurons with "unrewarded odor preference" from 1, so that both distributions ranged from 0.5 to 1 (Veit and Nieder, 2013) . To investigate the potential influence of licking on the measured neural responses, we tested whether our results were dependent on the inclusion of trials with early lick onsets (those occurring Յ200 ms from odor onset). Responses were then compared when spike times were aligned to lick onset for each rewarded trial. For this analysis, baseline firing rates were measured from Ϫ4 to Ϫ2 s relative to onset. The slope of the initial rise in auROC values was measured from 10% to 90% of the maximum auROC value. Results OT neurons show divergent responses to conditioned odors We monitored OT activity from 16 mice engaged in a head-fixed odor discrimination task requiring them to lick a spout for a water reward when presented with a conditioned-rewarded odor but not an unrewarded odor (Figs. 1, 2 ). This headfixed paradigm allows odor-guided behaviors while maintaining optimal precision in odor delivery (Verhagen et al., 2007) . Baseline and odor-evoked activity were measured for isolated single neurons (Fig. 3 ). In awake, behaving mice, the baseline rates of OT neurons were low, with a median rate of 1.9 spikes/s (range, 0 -77.8 spikes/s) across the sampled population (Fig. 3A ; measured 2 s before odor onset). Odor-evoked activity was observed with a variety of different odors and occurred shortly after odor onset (0.37 Ϯ 0.03 s; Fig. 3B ). After mice learned the original odor discrimination, we observed that the majority of OT single neurons significantly modulated their firing rate during the task window (87%, 165 of 190 neurons were "task responsive" within 7 s of odor onset). To characterize responses across this population, we measured the temporal response profile of each neuron during correct trials by quantifying changes in firing rate from baseline using a sliding ROC analysis (Cohen et al., 2012; Veit and Nieder, 2013) . Set on a 0 -1 scale, auROC values Ͼ0.5 indicate increases in firing rate relative to baseline (excitation), whereas values Ͻ0.5 indicate decreases (suppression). Task-responsive neurons typically displayed stimulus-evoked activity in response to both conditioned odors, but had higher fir-ing rates and more persistent activity during rewarded odor trials, as illustrated by an example single neuron in Figure 4A . Because both conditioned odors elicited increases in firing above the baseline rate in this neuron (Fig. 4A ), the auROC increased Ͼ0.5 after odor onset for both odors when referenced against the baseline rate of this neuron (Fig. 4B ). The improved discriminability of The early increase in auROC, which is similar for both rewarded and unrewarded odors (asterisk), may reflect trial-associated multisensory cues and/or arousal (Morrison and Salzman, 2009; Wesson and Wilson, 2010) . E, Average auROC values for rewarded trials when spikes times are aligned to odor onset versus lick onset, excluding trials identified with early lick onsets. Slopes of the initial rise were measured from 10% to 90% of the maximum auROC value (dashed lines), and were qualitatively steeper when aligned to odor onset than lick onset (0.021 vs 0.007 auROC/10 ms bin, respectively). Horizontal boxplots show the range of average lick onsets for all sessions included in the average (median, 0.41 s). An asterisk next to the boxplot indicates an identified outlier. Population values represent the mean Ϯ SEM. the response of the neuron to the rewarded odor is indicated by auROC values closer to 1 (perfect discriminability from baseline) and by the longer duration that values Ͼ0.5 were maintained (Fig. 4B ). Across the population of single neurons, auROC values Ͼ0.5 were observed shortly (Ͻ100 ms) after the onset of both the rewarded and unrewarded odors. Notably, these responses were maintained for a longer duration in response to rewarded than unrewarded odors (Fig. 5 A, B ). This period of extended discharge often persisted beyond odor offset and after the behavioral decision was made. Activity during this time period may reflect encoding of the reward state. Some neurons were also observed to transiently (Ͻ200 ms) increase their discharge at odor offset for unrewarded odor trials (Fig. 5 B, C ). These neurons may also display a transient discharge following offset of the rewarded odor (Fig. 5A ); however, this is difficult to detect given the persistent discharge associated with rewarded odor trials. The above single-neuron examples illustrate that several factors, including the conditioned odors themselves, appear to modulate OT neuron activity. To examine responses associated with the odor cues, we restricted all subsequent analyses to the time window before the behavioral (lick) response. Average population auROC values were greater for rewarded than unrewarded odors during a 200 ms window before the average lick onset (Fig. 5D ; paired t test: t (164) ϭ 4.796, p Ͻ 0.0001). To test whether motor preparation or the execution of licking could contribute to the observed difference in odor trials, we first confirmed that our results were not dependent on trials with early lick onsets (i.e., those occurring Յ200 ms from odor onset). Only 2.3% of all trials met the criterion for an early lick onset. Exclusion of these trials did not influence our results (Fig. 5E ), with mean auROC values to the rewarded odor being visually identical at all time bins to when these trials are included (Fig. 5 , compare D, E, blue traces). Next, we compared auROC values in response to rewarded trials when spike times were aligned to lick onset instead of odor onset for each trial (Fig. 5E ). Increases in auROC preceded lick onset by several hundreds of milliseconds, and the slope of the initial rise in auROC was less steep than when spike times were aligned to odor onset. To test whether individual OT neurons preferentially encode one conditioned odor over the other (i.e., are "odor selective"), we directly quantified the discriminability of firing rates between the rewarded and unrewarded odors using a second ROC analysis (values Ͼ0.5 indicate increased firing to rewarded odors). Neurons were identified as odor selective if there were at least two consecutive significant auROC bins during a time period from odor onset to behavioral response (see Materials and Methods). As indicated by the auROC, a substantial population of taskresponsive neurons were odor selective (73%, 120 of 165 neurons), with 83% of these odor-selective neurons (100 of 120) preferentially responding to the rewarded odor with higher firing rates than to the unrewarded odor (Fig. 6 ). Notably, these preferential responses occurred rapidly (0.21 Ϯ 0.01 s latency from odor onset) and hundreds of milliseconds before the lick behavioral response (Fig. 6 ; median first lick latency, 0.41 s). The finding that substantial changes in firing occur before lick onset indicates that odor valence information is present among OT neurons in a behaviorally relevant time window. Arousal and demands associated with behavioral tasks can impact neural coding (Spitzer et al., 1988; Maunsell, 2004; Otazu et al., 2009) . We hypothesized that the coding of conditioned odors within the OT is resilient to moderate changes in task demands. To test this, in separate behavioral sessions from a subset of the above mice, we used binary odor mixtures to increase the perceptual difficulty of the task (Uchida and Mainen, 2003; Abraham et al., 2004) . Binary mixtures of the rewarded and unrewarded odors were presented, and the mice were rewarded if they responded to the mixture containing the greater proportion of the rewarded odor. As expected (Uchida and Mainen, 2003; Abraham et al., 2004) , this paradigm resulted in reduced numbers of correct decisions made by the mice (71 Ϯ 2% correct; Fig. 7A ). Similar to what was found during the perceptually coarse odor discriminations (Figs. 5D, 6 ), responses to the conditioned odor mixtures also diverged, with neurons again increasing their firing rate for the rewarded mixture (Fig. 7B-D ; paired t test, t (72) ϭ 5.610, p Ͻ 0.0001). Thus, at least in the context of this comparison, the ability of OT neurons to encode odors within a behaviorally relevant time window is resilient to enhanced perceptual demands. Odor responses are highly plastic and encode the associated outcome of odors Are OT neurons selectively encoding the associated outcome of the odor? To address this, in a separate behavioral session we reversed the odor-outcome contingencies so that a previously rewarded odor is no longer rewarded and a previously unrewarded odor is now rewarded. A purely identity-encoding neuron should exhibit the same odor selectivity before and after reversal learning, whereas a neuron encoding the associative valence of an odor (rewarded or not) should reverse its odor preference; some combination of sensory and associative information may also be multiplexed within the same neuron (Roesch et al., 2007) . Most animals learned the reversed contingencies within a single session, allowing for paired comparisons among the same neurons both before and after reversal (n ϭ 58; Figs. 8 A, B, 9A ). The example neuron illustrated in Figure 8B displayed higher firing rates in response to the original rewarded odor (isopentyl acetate) than the unrewarded odor (ethyl propionate). After the associated odor outcomes were reversed, the behavioral performance of the animal dramatically decreased for two blocks, and firing rates of this neuron continued to be lower in response to ethyl propionate. As the animal learned the new odor-outcome contingencies, responses gradually shifted toward increased firing rates for ethyl propionate. Mice typically began to lick in response to the new rewarded odor before they could withhold licking responses to the new unrewarded odor. After successful reversal training, 69% of 54 task-responsive neurons were odor selective, with 84% of these neurons firing preferentially for the newly conditioned rewarded odor (Fig. 9B ). Again, significant divergence in firing occurred across the population (Fig. 9A ; paired t test: t (53) ϭ 2.330, p ϭ 0.0237) and was observed before lick onset (Fig. 9B ). Although a similar proportion of neurons displayed odor selectivity after reversal learning, the strength of discriminability indicated by average auROC magnitudes was reduced (Fig. 9C ; paired t test: t (53) ϭ 4.279, p Ͻ 0.0001). Only 11% of neurons (6 of 54) maintained the same odor preference after reversal, reflecting the encoding of odor identity, whereas 50% of neurons maintained the same odor valence preference (Fig. 9D ). In addition, a large proportion of OT neurons (39%) represented a combination of sensory and associative information. Nearly half of these "combinatorial" neurons reflected a gain in odor selectivity after reversal, whereas the other half lost odor selectivity with reversal. These data demonstrate that the bulk of OT neurons code for the associative valence of odors. Responses of OT neurons represent subsequent behavioral responses Do neural responses in the OT reflect the subsequent behavior displayed by the animal? To test this, in a subset of neurons recorded during the binary odor mixture discrimination task (n ϭ 76 of 88 neurons with sufficient error trial numbers), we compared auROC values from trials in which mice correctly identified the rewarded odor (hit) or unrewarded odor (correct reject) to trials in which the mice erroneously attempted to obtain a reward during the unrewarded odor (false alarm; Fig. 10A-C ). There were an insufficient number of miss trials to include in the analysis. Significant auROC periods of trial response selectivity were calculated (Fig. 10C ). We found that OT neurons preferentially fired for hit over correct reject trials (72% of 29 neurons) and for false alarm over correct reject trials (73% of 37 neurons). There was no clear preference when hit trials were compared with false alarms (48% of 25 neurons had preference for hits). Together, firing rates of OT neurons during false alarm trials more closely resemble rates during hit trials. Thus, the increased firing rates of OT neurons in response to conditioned odors appear to reflect the subsequent instrumental response of the animal to obtain a reward and support the possible behavioral relevance of these coding schemes. Discussion As the first study to describe odor-evoked activity among single neurons in the OT of behaving mice, we report that the firing rates of OT neurons robustly encode the learned valence of odors. We find that associative coding within the OT is rapid and highly plastic, with the majority of neurons preferentially firing for rewarded over unrewarded odors. Further, we find that odor coding within the OT is resilient against increased perceptual demands and appears to reflect the subsequent instrumental response of the animal. Our results unite two seemingly distinct theories of OT function-one as an olfactory processing node and one as a component of the reward system. By its anatomical connectivity, the OT provides a direct interface between the olfactory system and the striatum, which would allow these highly plastic odor representations to be translated into goal-directed behaviors. Insights into olfaction and associative odor coding among secondary olfactory structures The encoding of odors based upon their associative properties is observed within the olfactory bulb (Karpov, 1980; Wilson et al., 1987; Kay and Laurent, 1999; Doucette et al., 2011) , which may inform odor valence coding in secondary olfactory structuresthose that receive direct monosynaptic input from the olfactory bulb-and vice versa. Among secondary olfactory structures, the piriform cortex has been most highly explored for its associative coding of odor information (for review, see Gottfried, 2010; Wilson and Sullivan, 2011; Nunez-Parra et al., 2014) . Neurons in both the anterior and posterior regions of piriform cortex display odor cue selectivity, with greater firing rates in response to positively associated odors (Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995; Calu et al., 2007; Roesch et al., 2007; Gire et al., 2013) . Our results add the OT to the list of secondary olfactory structures capable of coding odor valence. This associative coding is somewhat unexpected, given that the OT lacks an associative fiber network (Haberly and Price, 1978), which is hypothesized as the mediator of some forms of associative coding in the piriform cortex (Hasselmo et al., 1990; Barkai et al., 1994; Haberly, 2001; Wilson and Linster, 2008) . Considering the associative coding in the piriform cortex (Calu et al., 2007; Wilson and Sullivan, 2011; Gire et al., 2013) , our results suggest that the olfactory system uses parallel pathways to code for odor valence. Additional research is needed to test whether the piriform cortex and the OT uniquely contribute to odor valence coding. Further, while this work does demonstrate associative encoding in the OT, it will be important for future studies to explore the coding of odor identity by OT neurons in awake animals independent of associative influences. Although many olfactory structures are heavily interconnected, the dense output from the OT into largely affective, motivational, and motor structures suggests that the coding of odor valence in the OT may be vital to a wide range of behaviors. This complements our understanding of associative coding in other downstream regions including the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens (Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995; Schoenbaum et al., 1999; Anderson et al., 2003; Setlow et al., 2003; Roesch et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008) . Determining the manners in which the OT interacts with other olfactory structures to facilitate sensory coding will be critical for understanding how the brain represents meaning to guide adaptive odor-based action selection. In the present study, we used a lick/no-lick olfactory discrimination task to experimentally manipulate the associative valence of monomolecular odors that mice had no prior experience with. While this is a highly simplistic paradigm, we predict that our finding of odor valence coding in the OT will be observed in other odor learning paradigms and to innately rewarding odors (e.g., food odors, social odors). Indeed, the OT receives input from two regions representing rodent social odors-direct input from tufted cells within the ventral olfactory bulb (Scott et al., 1980; Restrepo et al., 2004; Martel and Baum, 2007) Implications for ventral striatum function and motivated behaviors The OT is a component of the ventral striatum reward circuitry that serves as a "limbic-motor interface" to facilitate behavioral learning (Mogenson et al., 1980; Cardinal et al., 2002; Ikemoto, 2007; van der Meer and Redish, 2011) . The OT possesses dense reciprocal connectivity with the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, and multiple amygdaloid nuclei, as well as outputs to basal ganglia including the caudate-putamen (for review, see Wesson and Wilson, 2011) . Based upon this, we predict that the acquired odor valence coding observed within the OT could influence goal-directed behaviors through direct outputs to the basal ganglia (Fallon, 1983) . The role of the ventral striatum in associative encoding has been largely investigated within the nucleus accumbens. In the nucleus accumbens, cue-evoked responses are related to the associated outcome of a stimulus, rather than its sensory features, and are also sensitive to primary reinforcers themselves (Williams et al., 1993; Schultz et al., 2000; Carelli, 2002) . Here we provide data demonstrating that a previously underappreciated region of the ventral striatum also engages in associative encoding. In that sense, we believe that this work complements our understanding of how the ventral striatum encodes stimulus valence to guide instrumental behavior. As in any go/no-go paradigm, the motor preparation and execution of behavior (i.e., licking) could contribute to the differences we observed between rewarded and unrewarded odor trials. In the present study, odors were delivered for a 2 s duration, and mice were allowed to make the go response at any point during the odor presentation, on average only re-quiring 0.41 s to lick for reward. To ensure that differences in firing were not related to licking, we restricted all analyses to a time period from odor onset to the initiation of licking, confirmed that auROC values for odor discrimination sessions did not depend on trials with early lick onsets, and found that increases in the auROC preceded lick onset and had a more shallow rise when spike times were aligned to lick onset rather than odor onset. While these analyses suggest that the divergent responses in the OT are determined by the associative properties of the odors, it is possible that some neural activity within the OT is related to the initiation of goal-directed behavior, similar to what has been observed in the orbitofrontal cortex (Gutierrez et al., 2006) . Additional features of OT responses may be resolved in future studies by delaying primary reinforcers from the odor cues or by using alternative task designs. Conclusion In summary, our finding of associative encoding within the OT complements our understanding of how the ventral striatum encodes information to guide instrumental behavior. By using an olfactory discrimination task, we have discovered one more region of the olfactory system that is capable of conveying behaviorally relevant neural codes that are sensitive to the associative outcome of the odor. Elucidating the mechanisms that allow the OT to accomplish this task in such a robust and rapid manner, and testing the precise contributions of these transformations to behavior, will be critical in understanding the neural basis of odor-guided behaviors.

The prefrontal cortex is substantially innervated by serotonergic fibers from the dorsal raphe nucleus in both primates and rodents (Porrino and Goldman-Rakic, 1982; Morrison et al., 1982; Takeuchi and Sano, 1983; Smiley and Goldman-Rakic, 1996) . Of all the 5-HT receptor subtypes found in cortex, the G-protein-coupled 5-HT 2A receptor has received extensive attention in both physiological and pharmacological experiments. Immunocytochemistry has revealed abundant 5-HT 2A receptors on the dendrites of prefrontal pyramidal cells as well as in large and medium-sized calbindin-and parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998, 2000) . These receptors have been shown to have a facilitatory action on cortical pyramidal cells (Araneda and Andrade, 1991; Tanaka and North, 1993) , which includes a presynaptic action on glutamate release (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997) . In primate prefrontal cortex, serotonergic fibers terminate mainly in association with the smooth dendrites of putative interneurons (Smiley and Goldman-Rakic, 1996) . Accordingly, 5-HT 2A facilitation of this cell type (Gellman and Aghajanian, 1993, 1994) has been shown to produce considerable IPSCs in neighboring pyramidal cells (Zhou and Hablitz, 1999) . Therefore, the 5-HT 2A -mediated influence of serotonin on cortical function would be expected to involve an interaction of facilitatory and feedforward inhibitory components of intrinsic circuitry. Despite these insights into the physiology of cortical 5-HT 2A receptors, the consequences of serotonergic stimulation or depletion for cognitive function remains unclear. Although the study of Luciana et al. (1998) suggests that supranormal levels of serotonin may be deleterious for spatial working memory, others have demonstrated that depletion of serotonin leads to deficits in the cognitive process of decision-making, similar to that seen after damage to orbitofrontal cortex in humans (Rogers et al., 1999) . The 5-HT 2A receptor has also been shown to be particularly involved in the action of hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the cortex (Marek and Aghajanian, 1996) as well as in the therapeutic efficacy of antipsychotic medications (Meltzer, 1989 (Meltzer, , 1999)) . The circuitry of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has an established role in the working memory processes essential to human cognition (Goldman-Rakic, 1987; McCarthy et al., 1994 McCarthy et al., , 1996)) . Deficiency in these processes has been associated not only with the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits that are prominent in schizophrenia (Weinberger et al., 1986; Goldman-Rakic, 1991 , 1994; Liddle, 1987; Liddle and Morris, 1991; Park and Holzman, 1992) , but also with the positive symptoms of the disorder (Andreasen et al., 1997; Sabri et al., 1998; Lennox et al., 2000) . Single cell recordings of dorsolateral prefrontal neurons in nonhuman primates have revealed profiles of neuronal activation correlated with sensory, mnemonic, and response processes in both manual (Fuster, 1973) and oculomotor delayed-response tasks (ODRs) (Funahashi et al., 1989) . The delay activity observed in many prefrontal neurons has been shown to be spatially dependent, giving rise to "memory fields" with excitatory responses to targets in preferred directions and null or inhibitory responses to other targets in nonpreferred directions. A recent study of regular-spiking (RS) and fast-spiking (FS) neurons in prefrontal cortex has indicated that putative interneurons can also exhibit memory fields, which have similar tuning properties to those of neighboring pyramidal cells (Rao et al., 1999) . This cellular basis of working memory in prefrontal cortex provides an ideal model for testing the influence of different neurotransmitters on cognitive function at the cortical level. A previous study, using iontophoresis of selective dopamine D1 receptor agonists and antagonists, revealed an important relationship between the level of D1 receptor occupancy and the strength of pyramidal cell memory fields (Williams and Goldman-Rakic, 1995) . Here, we used a similar approach to investigate 5-HT 2A receptor modulation of delay activity of both RS and FS units in the ODR task, to determine the contribution of this particular receptor subtype to the influence of prefrontal serotonergic input on cognitive function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Use of animals. Studies were performed on two adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), which were cared for under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and Yale Animal C are Committee. They were prepared for chronic daily recording as previously described (Funahashi et al., 1989) . The recording cylinders were centered over the caudal principal sulcus using x-ray imaging and stereotaxic coordinates (Fig. 1 A) (Rao et al., 1999) . Magnetic resonance imaging in a number of recent monkeys has shown a high level of concordance in the coordinates used. Single-unit recordings at this site (Fig. 1 B, central position) frequently reveal spatially tuned delay activity: the hallmark of response properties in caudal area 46 and rostral area 8a of Walker (1940) . ODR task . The animals were trained in a spatial ODR task shown in Figure 1C (Funahashi et al., 1989) . In this task the monkey commences each trial by fixating a central stimulus (small square on monitor, or a light-emitting diode) within 2°for 0.5 sec and must continue to fixate while one of 8 peripheral stimuli (45°separation in circumference, 13°e ccentricity) is illuminated for 0.5 sec (cue period). There then follows a delay period of 2.5 or 3.0 sec during which the monkey must maintain fixation. At the end of this time the central stimulus is extinguished, and the monkey must make a saccade, within 0.5 sec (response period), to the position of the peripheral stimulus shown earlier (again within 2°) to be rewarded with fruit juice. The peripheral cues were presented in a semirandom order across trials such that, during the delay period, the monkey had to remember the cue location shown within the present trial to make the correct response. Note that the response period can be divided into a presaccadic epoch (lasting 250 msec from the end of the delay) because this incorporates the typical time required to initiate a saccade in this task (Funahashi et al., 1991) , and a postsaccadic epoch (lasting 500 msec) starting 500 msec after the end of the delay and therefore, by definition, after the performance of a successf ul saccade. Electrode design and construction. Electrodes were constructed either from 33 m carbon fiber (AVC O, L owell M A) inside quad-barreled glass (C lark Electromedical Instruments, Reading, UK) or, more commonly, from 20 m pitch carbon fiber (EL SI, San Diego, CA) inserted into the center of seven barrel nonfilamented capillary glass (Friedrich and Dimmock, Millville, NJ). The assembly was pulled through a heating coil element (nichrome wire; Narashige, Tokyo, Japan) using a proprietary, computer-controlled electrode puller. The latter allowed for the precise control of the heating-coil temperature, the time and velocity required to pull the shaft of the electrode (60 -62 mm in length), and the timing of the solenoid used to pull the tip of the electrode. The tip was f urther fashioned by a combination of spark etching and beveling on diamond (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) and stone (polishing) wheels. This helped to produce sharp tips, 20 -40 m, in length with impedances ranging from 250 k⍀ to 1.2 M⍀ (at 1 kHz) and a noise level of Ͻ15 V peak to peak. E xtracellular voltage was recorded with a custom (SK Y-L AB) low-noise preamplifier and was bandpass filtered between 180 Hz and 8 kHz (four pole Butterworth; Krohn-Hite, Avon, M A). At the beginning of each track, the dura was punctured with a 25 gauge hypodermic stainless steel guide tube (projecting from a 21 gauge guide tube), within which the electrode was lowered slowly into the brain using a MD-2 motorized hydraulic drive mounted on an MO-95 micromanipulator (Narishige). Pharmacolog ical agents and iontophoresis. In these and previous studies, we have focused on the effects of ligands that act as antagonists at particular receptors rather than agonist drugs. This is because the phys- iological activation by neurotransmitters at their designated receptors at particular locations on different neurons, and with a particular time course, can be best studied by examining the consequences of removing that action. Iontophoresis of an agonist may level the normal spatial and temporal profile of receptor action and, consequently, could obscure its f unctional significance. The drugs used in this study have well documented affinities at 5-HT 2A receptors. MDL 100,907 (Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) has high affinity (Ͻ1 nM) at 5-HT 2A receptors (Johnson et al., 1996) , whereas ritanserin (Janssen Pharmaceutical, Titusville, NJ) and LY53857 (Sigma / RBI, Natick, M A) have an order of magnitude higher affinity at 5-HT 2A receptors (Ͻ10 nM) than at 5-HT 2C receptors (Schreiber et al., 1995; Mazzola-Pomietto et al., 1996) . The partial agonist ␣-methyl-5-HT (Sigma / RBI), which has high affinity at 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity at 5-HT2C receptors (Garnovskaya et al., 1995) , was used to compare with, or reverse, the action of the antagonists. Serotonin (HC l salt; Sigma / RBI) was also used in some experiments to compare the actions of endogenous and exogenous agonists. The drugs were dissolved in 1 ml of triple distilled water (adjusted with HC l to pH 3.5-4.0) at a concentration of ϳ 0.01 M and stored in aliquots of 50 l at Ϫ70°C. Immediately before use, the drugs were sonicated briefly and drawn up into fine, f used-silica glass pipette fillers (W PI, Sarasota, FL), each instilled into one barrel of quad electrodes or two adjacent barrels of seven barrel electrodes, and forced to the tip by compressed air. Thus, three drugs could be tested with one electrode, typically one agonist and two antagonists. Teflon-coated platinum -iridium wires (Medwire, Mt. Vernon, N Y) were then fitted inside each drug barrel and connected to a Neurophore BH2 iontophoretic system (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, N Y) such that one channel (I P-2) of the device controlled the delivery of one drug. The results presented here are taken from findings with ejection currents ranging from 5 to 100 nA. Retaining currents of Ϫ3 to Ϫ5 nA were used in a cycled manner (1 sec on, 1 sec off) when not applying drugs, and current balancing was not required because of the low impedance of the electrode. Drug ejection did not create noise in the recording, and there was no systematic change in either spike amplitude or time course at any ejection current. Iontophoresis was started after a sufficient number of trials (Ն8) had been collected for each target position in the task under the control condition. Data acquisition and anal ysis. Eye movements were monitored with a magnetic search coil system (C NC Engineering, Seattle, WA) or by infrared pupil tracking (ISCAN, Burlington, M A). These data were incorporated into task control, performed by a PDP-11 running MON K software or by a personal computer running TEM PO (Reflective Computing, St. L ouis, MO). Spike waveform-sorting and data acquisition was run on a micro1401 using Spike2 software (C ambridge Electronic Design, C ambridge, UK). Waveform sorting (template matching algorithm) made it possible to isolate up more than one unit at the same recording site. The waveform templates constructed in the sorting were of sufficient range in amplitude that they could incorporate any moment by moment change in the magnitude of the spikes or slow drift in spike amplitude over time. The data collected from each unit was time-stamped (and the spike waveform stored) to precisely determine when each spike occurred relative to task events, and output via a text file for subsequent analysis. Unit activity was measured in spikes per second during each epoch of the trial (Fig. 1C ). Data were first collected from the cell under a control condition, followed by a drug condition in which one of the 5-HT 2A ligands was applied, and then typically a recovery condition after drug application had been terminated. Because the synthetic, high-affinity drugs used in these experiments take many seconds to act, they can also take a long time to wear off. Thus, although the general activity level of the cell may f ully return to normal by the end of the recovery condition, the value obtained for spatial tuning over the entire condition can only approach that in control (because multiple trials for each target direction are required in the analysis). However, in some recordings we used a post-drug condition immediately after drug application to ensure an optimal recovery condition afterwards. Occasionally dose-dependent effects of the drug were tested in two or more consecutive conditions, or an agonist was applied in the condition immediately after application of an antagonist (and vice versa) to detect reversal or opposing effects. Data were obtained from at least five trials (typically 10 or more) at each cue location for each condition. The first 30 -90 sec of data (or originally data from the first trial at each cue location) from noncontrol conditions was omitted from the text file to allow for the time taken for drug action. The text file data were processed by a proprietary Cϩϩ program for statistical analysis using the Student's two-tailed t test with unequal variance and an ␣ of 5%. In this way, data with a statistical probability level of Ͻ 0.05 were obtained for neuronal activity within each epoch of the task in comparison to baseline activity, and the effects of drug application on unit activity within each period of the task in comparison with the previous control condition. Population analysis was performed on normalized data, derived by first aligning the preferred directions of the population of tuned cells to 0°. The mean firing rate for each target location for each unit was then taken as a ratio to the mean activity over all target locations and plotted relative to the preferred direction. A similar analysis was performed for the percentage change in activity between drug and control conditions for each target location. One-way and two-way ANOVAs were performed on this normalized data, and the results were analyzed with post hoc Scheffe tests. Identification of single units. As previously reported (Mountcastle et al., 1969; Wilson et al., 1994; Rao et al., 1999 Rao et al., , 2000)) , it was possible to identif y two distinct putative cell types in vivo by measuring the time course of their spike waveforms. Fast-spiking (FS) neurons had relatively low-amplitude spikes (typically Ͻ50 V), biphasic action potentials, relatively high firing rates, and short spike durations of Ͻ 0.9 msec. Regular-spiking (RS) neurons typically had more complex triphasic waveforms with a larger initial negative deflection, relatively low basal firing rates, and long durations of typically Ͼ1 msec. FS units could only be tracked for typically Ͻ20 m, whereas RS units could often be tracked for Ͼ100 m, a distinction that probably arises from the larger dendritic field of pyramidal cells. Using a cutoff point of 0.9 msec spike-based width (the extracellular impulse being a close corollary to the first order differential of the action potential recorded intracellularly) (McCormick et al., 1985; Kawaguchi, 1993 Kawaguchi, , 1995)) , the two cell types could be readily segregated, in accordance with their other spike properties. A recent report by Gur et al. (1999) , recording from macaque V1 neurons, provides support for the assumption that units with different spike properties are likely to originate from cells of different types, which also show different physiological properties, as recognized in many previous in vivo rodent studies (Simons, 1978; Swadlow et al., 1998; Shimegi et al., 1999; Dantzker and C allaway, 2000; Morris and Henderson, 2000; Baeg et al., 2001; Timofeev et al., 2001) . For f urther details on the unit isolation and spike segregation used, see Rao et al. (1999) . Assessment of spatial tuning. Spatial signal strength and direction in neuronal response was analyzed by a vector algorithm (Rao et al., 1999) . Briefly, vectors were computed for loops constructed from firing rates for each target direction in order of occurrence (for five or more trials), and their dot-products were determined, relative to the resultant vector. A statistical comparison (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p Ͻ 0.05; Conover, 1971) of these scalar values was then made with arbitrary thresholds to yield an integer tuning factor (TF) ranging from 0 (untuned) to 10. The effect of a drug on this tuning was assessed by a statistical comparison (Wilcoxon sum-rank test, p Ͻ 0.05) of the final scalar values between the drug and control conditions. The angle of tuning, , varying continuously The cells were categorized according to whether they were tuned or untuned in the control condition, and the results are given separately for each drug tested as well as for the combined effects of the agonists and antagonists. All three antagonists showed a high propensity (90%) to attenuate the memory fields of the 31 tuned RS neurons and, only in rare cases, created tuning in the 44 RS cells that were untuned in the control condition. Conversely, the agonists showed a high proclivity both to enhance existing tuning and to create tuning in RS neurons. between 0°and 360°,was determined by taking the median angle of the individual loop vectors (Fisher, 1993) . RESULTS Effects of 5-HT 2A receptor blockade on the memory fields of RS units Of 75 RS units tested with 5-HT 2A antagonists, 31 (41%) displayed spatially tuned delay activity, firing maximally for one or two preferred directions and minimally for nonpreferred targets in the opposite region of space. When examined for their effects on the spatial-tuning of delay activity in RS units, iontophoresis of 5-HT 2A antagonists, ritanserin, LY53857, and MDL100,907, at 15-50 nA ejection currents, attenuated tuning in nearly all (28 of 31; 90%) cells that were tuned under the control condition (Table 1 ). Attenuation of tuning between the drug and control conditions was detected by a significant reduction ( p Ͻ 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum Test) in the vectors derived from the delay activity of the cell over all eight target directions (see Materials and Methods). Data are presented for one cell in Figure 2 A as rastergrams (top) and sum-histograms (below) for the preferred (315°) and nonpreferred (135°) target locations. In the control condition, it can be seen that the cell fired consistently for trials at 315°t hroughout the delay and the presaccadic epochs and showed a concomitant reduction in activity for trials at 135°. Iontophoresis of MDL100,907 at 25 nA produced a steady decline in the response of the cell for its preferred direction, which returned slowly during the recovery period after drug application. Note that the antagonist also reduced presaccadic activity (early response period) for the preferred direction and postsaccadic activity (late response period) for the nonpreferred direction of the cell (Fig. 2 A, right panel ). The polar plots of mean and SE of delay activity for all target locations in Figure 2 B shows the full extent of the memory field (TF ϭ 5; ϭ 319°; see arrow) in the control condition, its destruction by the 5-HT 2A antagonist, and its partial re-emergence (TF ϭ 6) in recovery at a similar angle of tuning ( ϭ 327°). The attenuation of spatial tuning in delay activity could also be seen at the population level by normalizing both the preferred direction of each cell to 0°and the activity for each target location relative to the mean activity over all target locations. The results are illustrated for 28 RS neurons in Figure 2C , which show that, in the control condition, there is a distinct elevation of activity for the preferred target location above the mean (scaled to unity), less elevation for the adjacent directions (Ϯ45°), and a clear depression below the mean for targets separated by 135-180°from the preferred location. ANOVA revealed a highly significant effect of location (F ϭ 21.87; p Ͻ 0.0001) with significant differences between activity for the preferred direction and all locations separated by Ն90°( p Ͻ 0.0001; Scheffe post hoc test). A highly significant drug condition by direction interaction (F ϭ 4.17; p ϭ 0.0002) was found between the control and drug conditions. The effect of direction still remained ( p Ͻ 0.0001), but its magnitude (F ϭ 4.63) and the post hoc differences between preferred and nonpreferred directions were much reduced in the presence of 5-HT 2A blockade ( p Ͻ 0.05 at Ϫ135 and 180°; p Ͻ 0.01 at ϩ135°). In rare instances (6 of 44 U), 5-HT 2A antagonists induced tuning in RS cells that were not previously tuned in the control condition. However, these drugs never improved tuning in those neurons that were already tuned in the control condition. To analyze further how delay activity was changed by 5-HT 2A blockade, we examined the percentage change in activity from control for each target direction for the same population of tuned RS units tested with 5-HT 2A antagonists. From the results presented in Figure 2 D it can be seen that the deleterious effect of 5-HT 2A blockade was produced by an overall selective reduction in activity within the memory field of the cell with a greater attenuation for the preferred target location (again normalized for each cell to 0°) than the two adjacent targets (ϩ45°, p Ͻ 0.0001; Ϫ45°, p Ͻ 0.0001). This effect would be expected to produce a profound attenuation of spatial tuning in RS cells. Effects of 5-HT 2A receptor stimulation on the memory fields of RS units If the effect observed on the spatially tuned delay activity of RS cells was, indeed, a direct effect of 5-HT 2A blockade, then we would expect that the agonist would produce an enhancement of the memory fields of these neurons. However, it should be recognized that iontophoretic application of the agonist onto a neuron under its natural conditions with an operational level of endogenous serotonin will not always produce a functionally significant influence (as discussed in Materials and Methods). In contrast to the effect of the 5-HT 2A antagonists, we saw no effect on most of the 21 RS cells tested with application of ␣-methyl-5-HT at 20-50 nA (Table 1 ). Nevertheless, 12 RS cells (57% of those tested) showed an elevated spatial tuning in the delay period with iontophoresis of the drug. Attenuation of the memory field was never found in RS units that previously showed any tuning in the control condition (n ϭ 6; 29%). The enhancement of spatial tuning in delay activity by the agonist is illustrated for one RS cell in Figure 3A . Here it can be seen that there is a modest differentiation of delay period activity between the preferred target location at 135°and the nonpreferred location at 315°. The relationship of this activity to the memory field of the cell is apparent from the adjacent polar plot in Figure 3B . This neuron had a TF ϭ 2 and a ϭ 124°(see arrow) in the control condition. Iontophoresis of ␣-methyl-5-HT at 40 nA increased delay activity in trials with the target at 135°but actually reduced it for those at 315°, increasing TF to 3, with remaining at 127°. When MDL100,907 was coapplied at 25 nA subsequently, the previous agonist-induced enhancement was reversed and the TF was reduced to 1, with at 130°(data not shown). Finally, when agonist application was terminated, continued iontophoresis of the antagonist destroyed the memory field completely, without any overall decrease in activity of the cell (bottom panel). Reversal of the deleterious effect of MDL100,907 on the memory field by the agonist was also observed in three additional RS cells. Population analysis of the agonist effect on 11 RS neurons that were tuned in the control condition, or became tuned in the drug 4 (Figure legend continues) mean for the delay activity of the cell across all target directions (shown by line). The histogram therefore depicts the dispersion of delay activity between preferred and nonpreferred target locations. A clear spatial profile can be seen in the control condition, which is highly diminished under 5-HT 2A blockade (asterisks denote significant differences from the preferred direction). D, Histogram showing the percentage change in delay activity produced by 5-HT 2A blockade (for the same neuronal population), relative to the activity in the control condition for each target location (preferred direction again normalized to 0°). A reduction in activity can be seen for the preferred direction, greater than that for the two adjacentlocations, and a small increase in activity is evident for opposite locations in space. A, Neuronal activity of an RS neuron showing a small response during the delay period for targets at 135°but not at 315°in the control condition. Iontophoresis of ␣-methyl-5-HT boosts the delay activity for the preferred direction while, at the same time, it depresses activity for the opposite location. The same cell tested with MDL100,907 (bottom panel ) shows a complete abolition of its previous response. B, The memory field of this cell exhibits modest tuning during the control condition (top), which is sharpened by application of the agonist (middle), but delay activity loses spatial specificity altogether after application of MDL100,907. C, Population analysis for 11 RS cells tested with the agonist reveals signs of a spatial profile in response in control (left) that is dramatically augmented by the agonist (right). Note that one cell was excluded from this analysis because it showed changes in activity for opposite directions in space between the first and second half of the delay period. D, Overall, the agonist produces a larger reduction in the delay activity for nonpreferred target locations than that for the preferred location in this population of cells. Conventions as in previous figure . condition, revealed a highly significant effect of the drug on the differentiation between activity for the preferred and nonpreferred target locations (Fig. 3C ). The preferred target location (again normalized to 0°) shows a small elevation of activity above mean, whereas the activity of nonpreferred target locations is moderately submerged. Even so, ANOVA revealed a distinct effect of direction (F ϭ 7.09; p Ͻ 0.0001) with significant post hoc differences at Ϫ90°, Ϫ135°, and 180°. Application of the agonist dramatically increased the effect of direction (F ϭ 29.32; p Ͻ 0.0001) with a significant drug by direction interaction (F ϭ 4.72; p Ͻ 0.0001). This effect was particularly prominent for the preferred target location of the cell, which created large post hoc differences not only with target locations 135°and 180°distant but also with the adjacent target locations (Ϯ45°). In this way, the spatial tuning of this population was considerably sharpened. Note that the distribution of activity about the mean for the agonist condition (Fig. 3C ) is even more polarized between preferred and nonpreferred directions than the population of tuned cells in the control condition that were tested with the antagonist (Fig. 2C ). Thus, not only is it possible for a population of cells with moderate or no tuning to become considerably tuned because of increased 5-HT 2A stimulation (above the endogenous level), but these cells appear to be more tuned than a separate sample of neurons recorded in the control condition. To investigate further the mechanism by which the agonist may exert its beneficial effects, we analyzed the percentage change in activity from the control condition at each target location for the same population of RS units tested with the agonist. As shown in Figure 3D , the agonist produced an overall decrease in delay activity which was significant for nonpreferred target locations ( p Ͻ 0.001; two-tailed t test) and significantly less for the preferred target location (0°) than the adjacent (Ϯ45°) locations ( p ϭ 0.003, p Ͻ 0.001; two-tailed paired t test). Thus, it appears that increasing 5-HT 2A receptor stimulation can enhance tuning in RS cells, primarily by producing a net reduction in their activity, both for the opponent, nonpreferred target locations and the two locations adjacent to the preferred target. Given the above results for the effect of an agonist with some selectivity for the 5-HT 2A receptor, we were interested to see whether elevation of serotonergic stimulation, by iontophoresis of 5-HT itself, could also have advantageous effects on the memory fields of putative pyramidal cells. Serotonin at 4 -10 nA improved tuning in five of nine (56%) RS cells, in three cases by significantly increasing the delay activity of the cell (Table 1 ). As illustrated in Figure 4 , 5-HT, at just 10 nA, produced a dramatic, spatially dependent increase in the delay activity of an RS cell exhibiting no apparent tuning in control. However, the modest increase in activity for the nonpreferred target locations partially offset this effect, such that the cell becomes only weakly tuned (TF ϭ 1; ϭ 11°). Although coapplication of MDL100,907 clearly reverses this increase in delay activity, its combined effect is distributed over all target locations such as to improve the signal to noise in the spatially-dependent firing of the cell and significantly enhance tuning (TF ϭ 2; ϭ 14°). Thus, 5-HT is A, In the control condition the cell shows barely any distinction in its response for the 0°and 180°t argets. However, on application of 5-HT at just 10 nA there is a marked enhancement of the firing of the cell that particularly accentuates the delay activity on 0°t rials. Subsequent coapplication of MDL100,907 (bottom panel ) dramatically reduces the firing rate and attenuates the previous selective response in the delay period. B, The delay activity of this RS cell does not show any spatial specificity in control but it develops into a significant memory field (TF ϭ 1) when 5-HT is applied (middle panel ). Coapplication of MDL100,907 produces a substantial reduction in the delay activity but sharply limits firing to a small region of space and, as a consequence, improves spatial tuning (TF ϭ 2). Conventions as in previous figures. capable of facilitating the spatially tuned excitatory input to the cell but, in the absence of producing any substantial inhibition, may not be so effective as ␣-methyl-5-HT in enhancing memory fields of RS neurons. In keeping with this supposition, it was observed that iontophoresis of ␣-methyl-5-HT at levels of Ͼ50 nA could produce a profound depression in the delay activity of RS neurons, as can be seen in the dose-dependent response of one RS neuron in Figure 5 . Thus, "excessive" stimulation of 5-HT 2A receptors by an exogenous agonist can result in attenuation of the memory fields of putative pyramidal cells. Effects of 5-HT 2A receptor blockade on the memory fields of FS units The above findings raised the possibility that ␣-methyl-5-HT raised the level of feedforward inhibition onto the RS cell being recorded from by activating surrounding inhibitory interneurons that also posses 5-HT 2A receptors. To more directly examine whether feedforward inhibition could be recruited by serotonergic transmission in the regulation of spatial tuning in pyramidal cells, we next investigated 5-HT 2A receptor modulation of mnemonic responses in FS neurons. Like RS units, most FS cells that were tuned in the control condition showed an attenuation of their memory fields (13 of 16; 81%) during application of a 5-HT 2A antagonist at 15-50 nA. As illustrated for one FS cell in Figure 6 , a clear directional specificity can be seen in the control condition with a maximal response for the 45°target location (TF ϭ 10; ϭ 65°), but this is lost after 5-HT 2A blockade (ritanserin, 25 nA) because of reduction in delay activity for the preferred direction of the cell. Note that the postsaccadic response for the nonpreferred target (225°) withstood 5-HT 2A blockade much more robustly. Population analysis of delay tuning in 13 of these cells (Fig. 6C ) showed a similar flattening of spatial profile (two-way ANOVA; drug-target location: p ϭ 0.0308) such that there were no significant post hoc differences between target locations in the drug condition. The percentage change in activity produced by 5-HT 2A blockade in this population of FS neurons did show an important difference to that found for RS neurons, such that, overall, activity increased for all target locations other than the preferred target direction (Fig. 6 D ). The possibility that endogenous 5-HT 2A stimulation might help to sculpt tuning in FS neurons by exerting a "surrounding" inhibition on their activity, was supported by two further observations. First, ␣-methyl-5-HT (25-50 nA) produced only attenuation in tuning of FS units (6 of 13), reducing their response for preferred target locations. Second, delay tuning could be induced by 5-HT 2A blockade in a number of previously untuned neurons in this spike class (7 of 31) by the "unmasking" of responses for preferred target locations. Thus, the effect of blocking 5-HT 2A receptor stimulation by the endogenous ligand on spatial tuning appears to be very similar between both major classes of cortical neurons that are positive for this particular serotonin receptor subtype and that already posses spatial tuning, but the effect on their actual firing rates was quite different. DISCUSSION Neuromodulation of the mnemonic process Previous studies in vitro on the actions of 5-HT 2A receptors have sought to determine their excitatory and inhibitory actions on different cell types in systems in which many of the normal functional inputs to these cells are absent. In the present study, we used iontophoresis to examine the function of the 5-HT 2A receptor on-line during behavior and, therefore, during the actual cognitive process in which these neurons operate. The major finding of this work is the demonstration that 5-HT 2A receptor stimulation leads to an augmentation of spatial tuning in putative prefrontal pyramidal cells while blockade of this receptor consistently attenuates existent tuning of this cell type. Consequently, it can be concluded that 5-HT 2A receptor stimulation is facilitatory for the mnemonic process occurring in prefrontal pyramidal cells participating in spatial working memory. The 5-HT 2A receptor has been shown in numerous studies to have direct facilitatory actions on both pyramidal cells and interneurons. Sheldon and Aghajanian (1991) and Marek and Aghajanian (1996) have shown that these receptors can powerfully activate interneurons in the piriform cortex, which in turn produce a profound inhibition of neighboring pyramidal cells. Likewise, Araneda and Andrade (1991) as well as Tanaka and North (1993) have shown that pyramidal cells and interneurons in the neocortex are facilitated in their excitatory responses by 5-HT 2A receptors. The significance of 5-HT 2A recruitment of cortical inhibitory interneurons has been demonstrated by Zhou and Hablitz, (1999) , who observed a dramatic induction of IPSCs in cortical pyramidal cells by ␣-methyl-5-HT which was reversible by This RS cell possessed a rather broad memory field in the control condition (top), which is clearly sharpened by iontophoresis of ␣-methyl-5-HT at 50 nA, despite some reduction in the overall level of delay activity. When agonist application was increase to 75 nA (bottom), the delay was further reduced to the extent that the memory field was dramatically attenuated. coapplication of the 5-HT 2A antagonist ketanserin. Finally, Aghajanian and Marek (1997) have recently shown that 5-HT 2A receptors directly facilitate pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex by a powerful effect at the "trigger zone" on their primary apical dendrites, which has now been shown to contain intense immunoreactivity for 5-HT 2A receptors (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998, 2000) . These findings, from work in vitro, point to direct facilitation and indirect feedforward inhibition of pyramidal cells by 5-HT 2A receptor activation. Our present work demonstrates that these mechanisms of facilitation and feedforward inhibition are operative in vivo, where they are integral to the construction of spatially tuned memory fields in putative pyramidal cells. Mechanisms of drug action Three distinctly different antagonists were used to demonstrate that 5-HT 2A blockade attenuated memory fields in prefrontal cortex. However, despite their differences in chemical structure and receptor affinity, all three compounds produced the same overall effect on putative pyramidal neurons with spatially tuned delay activity, as evidenced by the data from both RS and FS population analysis. Not only did the agonist produce the opposite effects on the spatial tuning of delay activity to the antagonists at the population level, but it was possible to see the competitive action of both drug classes on the memory fields of individual cells. As expected, the antagonist effects, when looked at in terms of actual changes in activity for preferred and nonpreferred target locations, are primarily consistent with an attenuation of response of the neuron to its spatially tuned excitatory inputs as well as some minor reduction in inhibition for nonpreferred target locations. The effects of the agonist are not so directly interpretable, as the primary effect appears to be an overall reduction in activity Figure 6 . Effects of 5-HT 2A blockade on FS neurons. A, An FS neuron which, in the control condition (top panel ), fired during the delay period on trials in which the target was at 45°, and in the postsaccadic epoch for the opponent target location (225°). Application of ritanserin gradually abolished the delay activity for the preferred target location but cue and presaccadic activity for this location, as well as the postsaccadic activity for the opposite target location, persisted longer during drug application. B, The memory field of this FS cell included responses to two adjacent targets at 45°and 90°that were both diminished after the application of ritanserin. C, A population of 13 FS cells that were tuned in the control condition showed a clear spatial profile in their delay activity that was practically abolished by 5-HT 2A blockade. D, Rather than generally reducing the activity of this cell type, the 5-HT 2A antagonists produced an overall increase in delay activity for all targets other than the preferred location in this cell population. Conventions as in previous figures. of RS neurons, primarily for their nonpreferred target locations. This reduction in activity is reasonably explained by the findings of Zhou and Hablitz (1999) that ␣-methyl-5-HT drives substantial feedforward inhibition in neocortex, just as 5-HT 2A stimulation does in piriform cortex (Gellman and Aghajanian, 1994) . Thus, the agonist may facilitate excitatory spatially tuned inputs to pyramidal cells while at the same time activating inhibitory mechanisms that preserve the spatial resolution of their mnemonic response. Moreover, we now show that the memory fields of these putative parvalbumin-containing interneurons are also 5-HT 2A -dependent. We therefore postulate that ␣-methyl-5-HT diffuses a sufficient distance to facilitate multiple surrounding interneurons with similar spatial tuning, which feedforward onto the pyramidal cells from which we recorded. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that iontophoresis of 5-HT itself at very low ejection currents boosted the delay activity of the cells without producing pronounced enhancement of spatial tuning. In this case, we would not expect the endogenous ligand to diffuse a significant distance from the recording site (because of selective processes of metabolism and reuptake), so low-level application of serotonin should not evoke considerable feedforward inhibition. Therefore, it can be postulated that the synergistic action of the 5-HT 2A receptor on both pyramidal cells, and the interneurons which innervate them, may be important for the expression of significant spatially tuned delay activity in prefrontal cortex. The outcome of this interaction would obviously depend on the level of serotonin release, reuptake and the sensitivity of the 5-HT 2A receptor on the two cell types. Despite this complexity, it is clear that serotonin recruits inhibitory networks that are integral components of the local circuits involved in modulating the construction of spatial tuning by excitatory afferents in prefrontal pyramidal cells. Comparison of 5-HT 2A and D 1 receptor effects In a previous study, we have shown that D 1 receptor blockade can dramatically enhance the tuning of prefrontal pyramidal cells during the delay period by directly boosting the strength of their memory fields, and in some cases, reducing activity even further in the opponent memory field (Williams and Goldman-Rakic, 1995) . This was suggested to be a direct action at the level of the spines on the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells where the majority of D 1 receptors are located. Thus, there appears to be a critical concentration range of cortical dopamine required for cellular function in working memory (Arnsten et al., 1994; Murphy et al., 1996; Zahrt et al., 1997; Lidow et al., 1998; Castner et al., 2000) . In contrast, the 5-HT 2A receptor appears to operate in a more linear range in the enhancement of prefrontal memory fields than the D 1 receptor. Stimulation of this receptor would be expected to increase the ability of EPSPs arriving at the proximal dendrites to reach sufficient magnitude for action potential generation. As such, it could preferentially increase the response of the cell to weaker excitatory inputs and in theory reduce the spatial tuning of its activity. Why this does not happen in pyramidal cells is most likely attributable to the strength of their excitatory input related to the preferred target direction (Funahashi et al., 1989) and the counteractive effect of increased inhibitory input to the cell for nonpreferred directions. Therefore, serotonin acting at 5-HT 2A receptors might provide a tonic facilitation of cortical pyramidal cells and interneurons that sets their level of responsiveness to their direct excitatory inputs as well as the degree to which they are held under the influence of inhibitory local circuits. Preliminary data indicate that this tonic facilitation appears to be consistent for neuronal responses in all epochs of the task, in contrast to the apparently selective suppression of mnemonic activity ascribed to D1 receptor stimulation in our previous report. Functional and clinical relevance From the evidence above it would be expected that increased serotonin release might unilaterally benefit working memory performance. However there is little or no data to support this case (Jakala et al., 1993; Curran and Travill, 1997; Ruotsalainen et al., 1997) , and the physiological findings from the present study might appear to be inconsistent with those from behavioral studies. One possible explanation for this is that under most normal conditions, the effects of 5-HT 2A receptor activation interact strongly with the effects of dopamine receptor activation, as suggested by a number of clinical and experimental studies (Kuroki et al., 1999; Ichikawa et al., 2001) . We propose an alternative hypothesis that may provide a better insight into the functions of serotonin in prefrontal cortex. In our experiments, only the stimuli relevant to the spatial working memory task are present, and the animal is highly motivated to engage in this task rather than any other behavior. When 5-HT 2A receptor activation results in facilitation of the inputs to the prefrontal cortex, only the relevant inputs are boosted, and therefore the signal-to-noise ratio in the system can only improve. However, in the presence of real world environmental stimuli, when there is motivation to engage in multiple behaviors, 5-HT 2A receptor activation of prefrontal neurons may cause the contents of working memory to become submerged in "noise" related to many alternative interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli. Accordingly, a recent fMRI study has shown that increasing task load on human cognition leads to increasing activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as more and more information is required to be held on-line (Manoach et al., 1997) . Secondly, hallucinogens have high affinities at the 5-HT 2A receptor (Aghajanian and Marek, 1999 ) and, although they may have their major actions in sensory systems, they may also have similar actions on cognitive systems. In a recent positron emission tomography (PET) study the 5-HT 2 /5-HT 1 agonist psilocybin was found to produce marked increases in cerebral metabolism in frontomedial and frontolateral cortex (Vollenweider et al., 1997) , which correlated positively with psychotic symptom formation. These effects could be reversed by the 5-HT 2A antagonist ketanserin, suggesting that sufficient activation of this hallucinoceptor can disrupt prefrontal function. In clinical studies, there is accumulating evidence that 5-HT 2A receptor blockade may help to ameliorate both the positive and negative symptoms, and to some extent, the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (Meltzer, 1999; Meltzer and McGurk, 1999) . Clozapine and other atypical neuroleptics have been shown to occupy 5-HT 2A receptors considerably more than D 2 receptors in PET studies of patients with schizophrenia (Farde et al., 1994 (Farde et al., , 1995;; Lundberg et al., 1996) . Although emphasis has been placed on the ability of 5-HT 2A antagonists to enhance dopamine release in prefrontal cortex as a possible antipsychotic mechanism (Iyer and Bradberry, 1996) , there is obviously a case for the direct involvement of these receptors in the manifestation of cognitive disorder in schizophrenia (Aghajanian and Marek, 2000) . Prefrontal dysfunction is also implicated in depression, in which there is evidence that stimulation of 5-HT receptors may be so low as to result in reduced cerebral blood flow in prefrontal cortex (Bremner et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1997) . Treatment of this insufficiency by serotonin reuptake blockers can reinstate normal blood flow in the frontal lobes, indicating the requirement for serotonergic facilitation of neuronal activity for proper function of this brain region. Therefore, our results support the proposal that 5-HT 2A signaling may also play an important role in the amelioration of cognitive function in this mental disorder (Degl'Innocenti et al., 1999; Hindmarch et al., 2000; Rajkowska, 2000) The present findings point to a beneficial role for 5-HT 2A receptors in the working memory process in primates performing a well learned task, although it remains to be seen whether increased activation of this serotonin receptor subtype could actually lead to disruption of mnemonic processing when task demands increase. Hence, our results support the assertion that alterations in 5-HT 2A receptor signaling may be a contributing factor to the development of cognitive dysfunction in mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression, and thus, may provide an important target for drug therapy.

A memory field can be seen in the control condition (top) that is diminished by the 5-HT 2A antagonist (middle). In recovery (bottom), the memory field returns in a similar shape, although smaller in size. C, Population analysis of the delay activity of 28 tuned RS cells tested with 5-HT 2A antagonists in the control (left) and drug (right) conditions. As described in Materials and Methods, the cells are first normalized for their preferred target location which is set to 0°and then the activity for each target location, relative to the preferred location is taken as a ratio to the (Figure legend continues) Figure 3 . 3 Figure3. Effects of 5-HT 2A stimulation on RS neurons. A, Neuronal activity of an RS neuron showing a small response during the delay period for targets at 135°but not at 315°in the control condition. Iontophoresis of ␣-methyl-5-HT boosts the delay activity for the preferred direction while, at the same time, it depresses activity for the opposite location. The same cell tested with MDL100,907 (bottom panel ) shows a complete abolition of its previous response. B, The memory field of this cell exhibits modest tuning during the control condition (top), which is sharpened by application of the agonist (middle), but delay activity loses spatial specificity altogether after application of MDL100,907. C, Population analysis for 11 RS cells tested with the agonist reveals signs of a spatial profile in response in control (left) that is dramatically augmented by the agonist (right). Note that one cell was excluded from this analysis because it showed changes in activity for opposite directions in space between the first and second half of the delay period. D, Overall, the agonist produces a larger reduction in the delay activity for nonpreferred target locations than that for the preferred location in this population of cells. Conventions as in previous figure. Figure 4 . 4 Figure4. Effect of serotonin on delay activity in an RS cell. A, In the control condition the cell shows barely any distinction in its response for the 0°and 180°t argets. However, on application of 5-HT at just 10 nA there is a marked enhancement of the firing of the cell that particularly accentuates the delay activity on 0°t rials. Subsequent coapplication of MDL100,907 (bottom panel ) dramatically reduces the firing rate and attenuates the previous selective response in the delay period. B, The delay activity of this RS cell does not show any spatial specificity in control but it develops into a significant memory field (TF ϭ 1) when 5-HT is applied (middle panel ). Coapplication of MDL100,907 produces a substantial reduction in the delay activity but sharply limits firing to a small region of space and, as a consequence, improves spatial tuning (TF ϭ 2). Conventions as in previous figures. Figure 5 . 5 Figure5. Dose-dependent effects of ␣-methyl-5-HT. This RS cell possessed a rather broad memory field in the control condition (top), which is clearly sharpened by iontophoresis of ␣-methyl-5-HT at 50 nA, despite some reduction in the overall level of delay activity. When agonist application was increase to 75 nA (bottom), the delay was further reduced to the extent that the memory field was dramatically attenuated. Table 1 .

The limited capacity of the visual system does not permit simultaneous processing of all information from our cluttered environment in detail. Selective attention helps overcome this limitation by preferentially routing behaviorally relevant information across the visual system. Simultaneous neural recordings from two cortical areas suggest that this selective routing depends on the degree of synchrony between neuronal groups in each cortical area (1) (2) (3) (4) . However, it is unclear how different cortical areas synchronize their activity. While direct interaction between two cortical areas may give rise to their synchrony, an alternative possibility is that a third area, connected to both of them, mediates cortical synchronization. Higher-order thalamic nuclei, like the pulvinar, predominantly receive input from the cortex rather than the periphery and their output strongly influences cortical activity in in vitro experiments (5) . Because directly-connected cortical areas are also indirectly connected via the pulvinar (Fig. S1 ), the pulvinar is ideally positioned to synchronize activity across visual cortex (6) (7) (8) . However, little is known about the functional role of these cortico-pulvinocortical loops. Selective attention modulates the response magnitude of macaque pulvinar neurons (9, 10) , and both humans and macaques with pulvinar lesions commonly present with attentional deficits (11, 12) . We therefore hypothesized that the pulvinar increases synchrony between sequential processing stages across visual cortex during selective attention. Information transmitted along the ventral visual cortical pathway is sequentially processed in interconnected areas V4 and TEO. We simultaneously recorded neural activity in the pulvinar, V4 and TEO during 51 recording sessions (13) . Spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded in each area from neurons with overlapping receptive fields (RFs). Monkeys performed a variant of the Eriksen flanker task, in which a spatial cue signals the location of a subsequent target flanked by distracter stimuli (> 80% accuracy overall; Fig. 1A ). Because directly-connected cortical areas like V4 and TEO only connect with restricted, but overlapping zones in the pulvinar (8, 14) , we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to ensure electrodes targeted interconnected pulvino-cortical sites. We performed probabilistic tractography on DTI data for each monkey, to map probable connections between the pulvinar, V4 and TEO. We identified pulvinar zones connected with V4 (yellow) and TEO (red), and delineated the region of overlap (green) through which the V4-pulvinar-TEO pathway likely traverses (Fig. 1, B and C ). V4 and TEO predominantly connected to ventral pulvinar, and there was substantial overlap between V4 and TEO projection zones in the pulvinar, with the TEO projection zone extending more caudally, consistent with previous anatomical tracer work (8, 14) . However, probabilistic tractography data had the advantage of delineating projection zones specific to individual monkeys, which cannot be precisely ascribed based on published tracer data. Guided by our structural connectivity maps, we positioned electrodes in the appropriate projection zones, and verified their location therein by taking structural scans of each electrode track (Fig. S7 ). We performed additional tractography analyses between voxels containing electrode tips, to show probable paths running directly between recording sites (Fig. 1, D-F ). If the pulvinar plays an important role in selective attention, then pulvinar neurons should signal where the monkey attends in our flanker task. Figure 2, A and B , show the population activity of pulvinar neurons aligned to the cue and target onsets, respectively. Pulvinar neurons responded robustly to the cue in their RF. While the monkey maintained attention at the RF location, there remained a small, but significant increase in pulvinar activity across the delay period (t test, p < 0.05). When a stimulus later appeared in the RF, pulvinar neurons showed a significantly greater response when the monkey attended to the RF location rather than outside the RF (in opposite visual hemifield; t test, p < 0.05). These results are consistent with previously reported attention-enhanced pulvinar responses to visual stimuli (10) and additionally show that the attentional locus is represented by pulvinar spike rate throughout the delay period when no stimuli are present. We further tested whether attention influenced pulvinar spike timing, specifically the synchrony between pulvinar neurons, by calculating the degree of synchrony between spike times and the LFP, or spike-field coherence. For spectral analyses, we largely focused on the delay period after the cue-evoked response until the array onset, because not only did the monkey maintain spatial attention during this interval, but the data in each session generally satisfied methodological assumptions of stationarity as well. Figure S2, A and B , show a typical session in which pulvinar spike-field coherence increased immediately after the cue appeared in the RF, predominantly in the alpha-frequency range. While the monkey attended to the RF location, the spike-field coherence remained significantly elevated throughout the delay period until target presentation (t test, p < 0.05). When the cue appeared outside the RF (Fig. S2, C and D ), drawing the monkey's attention away from the RF, there was much weaker spike-field coherence. At the population level, there was significantly greater spikefield coherence in the 8-15 Hz range (alpha band) during the delay period until target presentation when the monkey attended to the RF location rather than outside the RF (Holm's controlled t tests, p < 0.05; Fig. 2C ). Because synchronized thalamic output provides increased drive to the cortex in anesthetized animals (15, 16) , increased synchrony of pulvinar neurons may be an effective means to influence visual cortex during selective attention. We next aimed to establish that selective attention increased synchrony between cortical areas (1-3). We calculated the coherence between V4 and TEO LFPs, which measures the synchrony between oscillatory processes in the two areas, as a function of oscillation frequency. Attention generally increased coherence between V4 and TEO LFPs in two frequency bands. There was significantly increased mean coherence in the 8-15 Hz range as well as a smaller, but significant increase in the 30-60 Hz range (gamma band) across the population (Holm's controlled t tests, p < 0.05) during the delay period until target presentation (Fig. 3A ). Because low frequency oscillations modulate higher frequency oscillations (18) (19) (20) , we tested whether attention increased cross-frequency coupling between alpha and gamma oscillations within V4 and TEO. To measure cross-frequency coupling, we calculated the synchronization index between cortical alpha oscillations and the gamma power envelope. Across the population, there was a significantly greater synchronization index for V4 and TEO during the delay period when attention was directed to the RF location rather than outside the RF (sign tests, p < 0.05; Fig. S3, A and B ), suggesting that alpha oscillations contributed to the attention effect on gamma frequencies. If the pulvinar interacts with the cortex during attentional processing, then attention should also modulate pulvino-cortical synchrony. Across the population, there was significantly greater alpha-band coherence between the pulvinar LFP and V4 LFP (Fig. 3B ) as well as between the pulvinar LFP and TEO LFP (Fig. 3C ) during the delay period until target presentation, when the monkey attended to the RF location rather than outside the RF (Holm's controlled t tests, p < 0.05). This result is consistent with previous reports of synchrony between the cat lateral posterior-pulvinar complex and visual cortex (21, 22) . Pulvinar spike trains also synchronized with cortical LFPs. Figure 3, D and E , respectively show attention effects aligned to cue and target onsets for a typical session. Attention significantly increased coherence between pulvinar spikes and V4 LFP after the cue appeared in the RF until target presentation, predominantly in the 8-15 Hz range (t test, p < 0.05). There was much weaker coherence after the cue had drawn attention away from the RF (Fig. 3, F and G ). We obtained similar attention effects on the coherence between pulvinar spikes and TEO LFP (Fig. S4 ). Across the population, spatial attention significantly increased the coherence between pulvinar spikes and V4 LFP (Fig. 3H ) as well as between pulvinar spikes and TEO LFP (Fig. 3I ) predominantly in the 8-15 Hz range, throughout the delay period until target presentation (Holm's controlled t tests, p < 0.05). These findings support the idea that the pulvinar is part of the brain's attention network (9, 12, (23) (24) (25) and that it uses the alpha band as a fundamental operating mode. To determine the direction of pulvino-cortical interactions, we calculated the conditional Granger causality in the frequency domain, for the connections between the pulvinar, V4 and TEO. Conditional Granger causality measures the influence that one area (e.g., pulvinar) has on a second area (e.g., TEO) accounting for the influence of other areas (e.g., V4). This allowed us to dissect contributions from each connection, and thus test our overall hypothesis that the pulvinar modulates cortical synchrony according to attentional demands. The pulvinar influenced oscillatory activity in both V4 and TEO when the monkey attended to the RF location. Figure 4, A and B , show pulvinar influence on alpha activity in V4 significantly increased (p < 0.05) after the cue and continued until target presentation. There was much weaker pulvinar influence on V4 when the cue had drawn attention away from the RF (Fig. 4, C and D ). Across the population, pulvinar influence on V4 (Fig. 4E ; Holm's controlled t tests, p < 0.05) and on TEO (Fig. 4F ; Holm's controlled t tests, p < 0.05) in the alpha-frequency range during the delay period was significantly greater with attention at the RF location versus outside the RF. Importantly, pulvinar influence on alpha activity in both V4 and TEO correlated with the attentional modulation of synchrony between V4 and TEO in the same frequency range (Fig. 3A ), suggesting that the pulvinar regulated alpha synchrony between cortical areas according to attention allocation. In contrast to pulvino-cortical influences, direct cortico-cortical influences during the delay period were weak. Figure 4, G and H , show the population conditional Granger causality spectra for V4′s influence on TEO and TEO's influence on V4, respectively. Spatial attention did not significantly change the weak influence of V4 on TEO, nor the weak influence of TEO on V4, during the delay period (t tests, p > 0.05). However, there was evidence consistent with strong cortico-cortical influences during visual stimulation (Fig. S5 ). These results suggest that maintenance of attention in the absence of visual stimulation depended on pulvino-cortical interactions (supplementary online text) rather than direct cortico-cortical interactions. Our results show that the pulvinar modulates the synchrony between cortical areas according to the locus of attention. The pulvinar predominantly influenced cortical alpha oscillations, consistent with another thalamic nucleus, the lateral geniculate nucleus, driving occipital alpha rhythms (26) . Evidence suggests that the rhythmic excitability of alpha oscillations gates visual events, with the phase of alpha oscillations critical for transmission of visual information (17, 27, 28) . Thus, the pulvinar, by synchronizing distributed patches of cortical alpha activity, can selectively facilitate transmission of information about attentional priorities across cortex. Because pulvinar-controlled alpha activity modulated gamma activity in cortex through cross-frequency coupling, pulvinar influence on cortical synchrony extends to frequencies higher than alpha. Pulvinar control of cortical processing challenges the common conceptualizing of cognitive functions as being restricted to cortex. Pulvino-cortical influences dominated during the delay period, suggesting that internal processes such as maintenance of attention in expectation of visual stimuli and short-term memory rely heavily on pulvino-cortical interactions. Pulvinar regulation of alpha activity is consistent with the important role ascribed to alpha oscillations in these internal processes (17, 29) . The prevailing view that information about our visual environment is transmitted through a network of cortical areas for detailed processing needs to be revised by considering extensive pulvino-cortical loops that regulate the information transmitted between each cortical stage of visual processing. Because of common cellular mechanisms and thalamocortical connectivity principles across sensorimotor domains, a general function of higherorder thalamic nuclei may be regulation of cortical synchrony to selectively route information across cortex.

Monkeys maintained fixation throughout trials, while we manipulated their locus of attention. The monkeys' attention was drawn to the location of a cue, which randomly appeared at one of six locations. The cue signaled the location of the target in the subsequent array of six stimuli. To receive juice reward, monkeys immediately released the lever after onset of a barrel-shaped target or after disappearance of the stimulus array for a bowtieshaped target.

Introduction There has been a great deal of interest in frequency-specific oscillatory activity in relation to cognitive functions (Kahana et al., 2001; Herrmann et al., 2004; Kahana, 2006) . For example, the suppression of scalp-recorded alpha has been associated with general alerting when people are given a cue as to when a target will occur (Babiloni et al., 2004) and with changed activity within the visual cortex when attending to a target (Yamagishi et al., 2005) . During attention to a visual target, increases in alpha activity at unattended locations have been related to the success of distracter suppression (Worden et al., 2000) . Increased gammaband activity has been associated with visual attention in scalp recordings (Keil et al., 2001) and in studies of neural activity within the visual system (Fries et al., 2001; Womelsdorf et al., 2006) . Gamma-band activity has also been associated with awareness of stimuli, another important aspect of attention (Crick and Koch, 1990) . Theta activity has been associated with aspects of task monitoring, including error detection, that are often associated with executive attention (Luu et al., 2004) . Beta-band activity has been found to synchronize between two remote electrode sites at the time information is being passed from one brain area to another (Nikolaev et al., 2001) . This transfer of information between remote locations could be considered another function of attention. Because attention is not a unitary function, it is important to relate these oscillations to different attentional networks. Human attentional processes can be conceptualized as a system of anatomical areas consisting of three specialized networks (Posner and Petersen, 1990) . These networks carry out the functions of alerting to achieve and maintain an alert state, orienting to turn attention toward a sensory signal, and executive control to monitor and resolve conflict in the presence of competing information. We developed the attention network test (ANT), which provides measures of the function of these three attentional networks. We have shown that these networks are roughly independent in a behavioral study (Fan et al., 2002) and that they involve different anatomical areas as revealed by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (Fan et al., 2005) . The alerting network showed strong thalamic activation and activation of anterior and posterior cortical sites, the orienting network showed activation of expected frontal and parietal sites, and the executive control network showed activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) along with several other brain areas, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex. In this study, we investigated whether these three networks are related to the same or different oscillatory neuronal dynamics. To achieve this, we conducted a high-density event-related potential (ERP) study using the ANT on participants, some of whom previously participated in the fMRI study (Fan et al., 2005) . Dipole source modeling was performed using spatial constraints pro-vided by the activation from the fMRI study and power spectrum analysis was conducted to examine synchronous activity change associated with the processes of these attentional networks. Materials and Methods Participants. Thirty-six right-handed neurologically normal adults (mean age, 27.2 years; SD, 5.2, range, 19 -36 years; 18 male), 12 of whom participated in the event-related fMRI study (Fan et al., 2005) , participated this study. Participants had normal or corrected to normal vision. A signed informed consent was obtained from each participant before the experiment. Attention network test. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the ANT. Stimuli consisted of a row of five horizontal black lines, with arrowheads pointing left or right, against a gray background (Fig. 1 , two target conditions). A single arrow subtended 0.58°of visual angle and the contours of adjacent arrows or lines were separated by 0.06°of visual angle. The target was a leftward or rightward arrow at the center, flanked on either side by two arrows in the same direction (congruent condition), or in the opposite direction (incongruent condition). The stimuli (one center arrow and four flanker arrows) subtended a total 3.27°of visual angle. The participants' task was to identify the direction of the target by pressing one key for the left direction and a second key for the right direction. The row of five arrows was presented in one of two locations, either 1.06°above or below the fixation cross. Thus, participants had to shift attention from the fixation point to the target location on each trial to determine the proper response. To measure the alerting and orienting benefits, a cue (an asterisk sign) was presented before the appearance of target. There were three cue conditions: no cue (baseline), center cue (at the fixation for alerting), and spatial cue (at the target location for alerting plus orienting). The operational definitions of the effects of the three attentional networks based on reaction time (RT) were as follows: alerting effect ϭ RT no cue Ϫ RT center cue , orienting effect ϭ RT center cue Ϫ RT spatial cue , and conflict effect ϭ RT incongruent Ϫ RT congruent . The same contrasts were used for the calculation of these three effects based on accuracy. The contrasts for the alerting and orienting effects were flipped for the fMRI and ERP data analysis (i.e., alerting effect ϭ center cue Ϫ no cue, orienting effect ϭ spatial cue Ϫ center cue). For the interpretations of the attentional network scores, see our previous publication (Fan and Posner, 2004) . Procedures. In each trial, depending on the condition, a cue was (center cue or spatial cue condition) or was not (no cue condition) presented for 200 ms. After a variable duration (300 -1450 ms with an average of 550 ms), the target (with flankers) was presented until a response was made. The time window for participants' response was 2000 ms after target onset. The duration between the onset of the target and the start of the next trial was also variable (3000 -4200 ms with a mean of 3300 ms). Each trial persisted 4050 ms on average. A fixation cross appeared in the center throughout the whole experiment. Participants performed a total of six blocks of trials, each block lasting ϳ8 min. Each block consisted of 108 trials plus six buffer trials at beginning of each block. Trial order was counterbalanced as in the fMRI study (Fan et al., 2005) . Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible with the left mouse button if the central arrow pointed left and the right mouse button if the central arrow pointed right using their left and right thumbs, respectively. The stimuli were the same as those used in the fMRI study except that the intervals between cue and target and between target and next trial were shorter. Stimulus presentation and behavioral response collection were performed using E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) on the experimental control personal computer, which was synchronized and communicated with the ERP data recording system. The trial events, including the cue and target type, and onset/offset time were sent to the ERP data recording system via a standard serial port. ERP acquisition. Electrical data were recorded from 128 scalp sites using the Geodesic EEG Net Station (EGI, Eugene, OR) and the 128channel Geodesic Sensor Net (Tucker, 1993) . The impedance of all electrodes except bad electrodes (no more than two per session) was Ͻ40 k⍀ at the beginning of the experiment. EEG was recorded using a 0.1-100 Hz bandpass filter. The signals were sampled at 250 samples/s and were digitized with a 12 bit analog-to-digital converter. All recordings were referenced to Cz, then average-referenced off-line. Behavioral data analysis. Trials with incorrect responses or with RTs longer than 1000 ms or shorter than 200 ms were excluded. The averaged RTs for each of the six combinations (three cue conditions by two target conditions) were calculated. The network scores were then calculated based on the operational definitions of the effects of the three attentional networks. The mean RTs from the two target conditions under each of the three cue conditions were averaged for the alerting and orienting calculation, and the mean RTs from the three cue conditions were averaged for the two target conditions separately for the calculation of the conflict effect. Grand averages of RT and accuracy, and the correlations among network scores were also calculated. ERP data analysis. Initial off-line processing of the data was performed using Net Station software (version 2.0; EGI). ERPs were filtered using a 60 Hz notch filter before segmentation. ERPs for correct trials were segmented into epochs that were time-locked according to cue onset, target onset, or response. For the no cue trials, the waveforms during the no cue period were also segmented as if real cue events occurred. The average of these no cue segments, which represents the average overlap of adjacent events/trials, served as the baseline. The overlapping activity can be subtracted out using this baseline as demonstrated by other studies (Busse and Woldorff, 2003; Talsma and Woldorff, 2005) . The time window was from 200 ms prestimulus to 800 ms poststimulus for both cue and target onset locked segments, and 400 ms before and 400 ms after response for response locked segments. Trials containing eye-blink, eye-movements, or an excessive number of bad channels (Ͼ10) were identified using Net Station's moving window algorithm and excluded from additional analysis. Trials with incorrect responses were also excluded from additional analysis. In remaining trials, data for bad channels were replaced using spherical spline interpolation (Perrin et al., 1987) . Segmented ERP data were then analyzed using Brain Electrical Source Analysis (BESA) 5.1 software (MEGIS Software, Grafelfing, Germany). First, epochs for analysis were defined both for the cue period (50 ms before cue onset to 450 ms after cue onset), the target period (100 ms before target onset to 700 ms after target onset), and the response-locked period (300 ms before response to 300 ms after response). Because EGI exports both "bad" and "good" segments, a second round of artifact rejection was performed using BESA. ERP data from one subject were excluded from the ERP and the subsequent analysis because artifacts during data recording. Power spectrum analysis based on dipole modeling. The goal of the In each trial, depending on the cue condition (no cue, center cue, or spatial cue), a cue may appear for 200 ms. After a variable duration (300 -1450 ms), the target (the center arrow) and flankers of two left and two right arrows (congruent or incongruent flankers) are presented. The participant makes a response to the target's direction within a time window of 2000 ms. The target and flankers disappear after the response is made. The target and post-target fixation period lasts for a variable duration (3000 -4200 ms). present analysis was to characterize the power changes associated with each attentional function across a wide range of frequencies. We first considered performing this analysis by analyzing power changes at the scalp level. However, the sensitivity of this method is decreased relative to analysis of power changes at the dipole level because all cortical sources contribute to the signal observed at any given electrode. We instead chose to model power changes at the dipole level for this and the following reasons. First, dipole-level analysis would allow us to characterize power changes associated with individual structures and, thus, makes it possible to associate power changes with the physical networks supporting each attentional function. Second, drawbacks associated with dipole modeling would be minimized because we were able to minimize experimenter bias and partially avoid the inverse problem by constraining dipole locations based on clusters of activation found in our previous fMRI study of the ANT (Fan et al., 2005) . This was especially advantageous for the purposes of the current study because high-frequency components, such as those in the gamma band, may not be systematically colocalized with average evoked potentials (Tallon-Baudry et al., 2005) ; use of average evoked potentials to estimate dipole locations would present a challenge for the interpretation of changes in power of high-frequency components. Although average evoked potentials were used to estimate the direction of dipoles once they were placed, this method may still confer significant advantage over power-change analyses performed at the scalp level. Dipole locations were based on clusters of activation identified in our previous fMRI study of the ANT (Fan et al., 2005) . Table 1 shows the coordinates of the dipoles used in each analysis. For each condition, separate dipoles were located at the geometric center of mass of each cortically located region of activation as identified in the fMRI data. The relative level of activation for each voxel was not considered when calculating the center of mass. We followed the method described by (Crottaz-Herbette and Menon, 2006) to exclude brain regions such as the thalamus from dipole modeling that were activated in the fMRI data but that do not exhibit the columnar organization necessary to generate a field that can be recorded on the scalp. We also excluded the cerebellum from dipole modeling because the cerebellum generates its own independent electric activity that does not contribute to the scalp recording of the ERP (Tyner and Knott, 1989) . Dipoles were positioned at the center of mass of all clusters identified in the fMRI study whose anatomical locations met the above criteria. Therefore, the alerting network had five dipole sources (the superior colliculus cluster, which had peaks in the left and right thalamus, and the cerebellar vermis cluster were excluded from the original seven clusters), the orienting network had eight dipole sources, and the executive control network had seven dipole sources (the thalamus and cerebellar vermis clusters were excluded from the original nine clusters). The dipole positions were fixed and the orientations were allowed to vary. Given that the ERP sample was a superset of the fMRI sample, the locations used were an approximation. We did not attempt to improve the fit by loosening the location constraint because this would introduce uncertainty. Empirical testing has shown that a small degree of deviation of a dipole's location does not significantly affect the model fitting. The grand-averaged difference waveforms of the alerting, orienting, and conflict effects calculated from the cue-, target-, and response-locked ERPs of all participants were used for dipole direction estimation. The fitting periods for the cue-locked ERP were 0 -450 ms after cue onset for alerting and orienting effects, 0 -700 ms after target onset for conflict effect, and 300 ms preresponse to 300 ms postresponse for the responselocked analysis. To avoid fitting with bias, all dipoles were fitted simultaneously without any additional selection to link an ERP component to a specific dipole during a certain time period. Average surface points of the Geodesic Sensor Net provided by BESA were used. The BESA source model solutions for each network generated from the grand averaged ERPs were applied as montages to the individual participants' cue-, target-, or response-locked epochs of each trial, and power spectrum analyses were performed in BESA separately for each cue and target condition. This method can be defined as analysis of induced activity of frequency bands (Senkowski et al., 2005) . For the spectra, time-frequency sampling was 2 Hz/25 ms. BESA uses a complex demodulation to transform time-domain data into the timefrequency domain (Papp and Ktonas, 1977) . This complex demodulation consists of a multiplication of the time-domain signal with a complex periodic exponential function, with a frequency equal to the frequency under analysis, and a subsequent low-pass filter. This low-pass filter is a finite impulse response filter of Gaussian shape in the timedomain, which is related to the envelope of the moving window in wavelet analysis. For our setting of a 2 Hz/25 ms time-frequency sampling, this filter has a width in the frequency domain of 5.7 Hz and in the timedomain of 79 ms full width at half maximum. For more details about the BESA power spectrum analysis, see a previous publication (Hoechstetter et al., 2004) . For sources of each attentional network, power spectra were computed for each trial and then were averaged for each participant under corresponding cue or target conditions. Power changes compared with the average of prestimulus or postresponse baseline period were plotted. In the cue conditions (no cue, center cue, spatial cue), the time axis was from 50 ms precue to 450 ms postcue, the frequency axis was from 4 to 100 Hz, and power change was defined as percentage of baseline (the average power of the 50 ms before stimulus onset). For the alerting montage, spectra were generated for all five sources in the no cue and center cue conditions, and the alerting effect was shown as the contrast of center cue minus no cue. For the orienting montage, spectra were generated for all eight sources in the center cue and spatial cue conditions, and the orienting effect was shown as the contrast of spatial cue minus center cue. In the target conditions (congruent and incongruent), the time axis was from 100 ms pretarget to 700 ms post-target, the frequency axis was from 4 to 100 Hz, and power change was defined as percentage of baseline (the average power of the 100 ms before stimulus onset). For the response locked analysis, the time axis was from 300 ms preresponse to 300 ms postresponse, and the baseline was 200 -300 ms postresponse. For both target-locked and responselocked executive control montages, spectra were generated for all seven dipole sources in the three cue (no cue, center cue, and spatial cue) by two target (incongruent and congruent) conditions, and the conflict effect was shown as the main effect of the difference between the power spectral changes under incongruent and congruent conditions. The modulation of the alerting (center) cue and the orienting (spatial) cue on target response was also examined. Averaged power-change plots of each participant corresponding to each condition were filtered separately using a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel with an SD of 6 Hz/75 ms before group analysis. This extra step, in addition to using the moving window in the power spectrum analysis, increased the statistical power of group data analysis to detect differences between conditions at the cost of time and frequency resolution. This is similar to the use of spatial filers on raw or normalized blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal images to increase the power of statistical analysis for random effects in fMRI analysis. To determine the significance of an attentional effect, a paired t test was performed on each data point in the two corresponding filtered power-change spectra. A final time-frequency plot was then generated with the color map representing the t value of the power change difference between two conditions at each data point. This analysis was performed using Matlab 6.5 software (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Assuming an individual voxel type I error of p Ͻ 0.01, a Monte Carlo simulation of the current study revealed that, to correct for multiple comparisons, the finding of significance could only be claimed if 20 contiguous original pixels, regardless of cluster shape, reached significance. For example, the finding of ͉t(34)͉ Ͼ 2.73 for each pixel in a cluster of 5 ϫ 4 pixels (10 Hz ϫ 100 ms) was needed for that cluster to reach significance. Frequency bands were defined as theta ϭ 4 -8 Hz, alpha ϭ 8 -14 Hz, beta ϭ 14 -30 Hz, and gamma 30 -100 Hz, with no overlap at the edge. The beta band includes the lower range beta (14 -18 Hz) and the upper range beta (18 -30 Hz) (Foffani et al., 2005; Merica and Fortune, 2005) . The gamma-band (30 -100 Hz) includes the low-gamma (30 -80 Hz) and part of the high-gamma (80 -160 Hz) range (Canolty et al., 2006) . The ERP waveform for each dipole source was also averaged across all participants and plotted beside the power spectrum change map for comparison purposes. Results Behavioral results Figure 2 A shows the RT results. The overall RT for all conditions was 580 ms (SD, 63 ms). The RTs for each condition were 569 ms for no cue-congruent, 660 ms for no cue-incongruent, 538 ms for center cue-congruent, 650 ms for center cue-incongruent, 500 ms for spatial cue-congruent, and 568 ms for the spatial cueincongruent condition. The alerting, orienting, and conflict effects were 20 ms (SD, 16 ms), 60 ms (SD, 25 ms), and 90 ms (SD, 28 ms), respectively. ANOVA showed that the factor of cue level was significant (F (2,70) ϭ 216.98; p Ͻ 0.01), the factor of target condition (conflict effect, 536 ms for congruent vs 626 ms for incongruent) was significant (F (1,35) ϭ 370.78; p Ͻ 0.01), and the interaction between cue and target was significant, F (2,70) ϭ 44.20; p Ͻ 0.01). The alerting by conflict and the orienting by conflict interactions were significant (F (1,35) ϭ 23.49 and F (1,35) ϭ 88.60; p values Ͻ 0.01), indicating that the conflict was significantly greater in the center cue condition than in the other two conditions. Simple comparisons showed that the alerting and orienting effects were significant (F (1,35) ϭ 52.53 and F (1,35) ϭ 208.46; p values Ͻ 0.01). The correlations between the alerting and orienting scores (r ϭ Ϫ0.08), between alerting and conflict (r ϭ Ϫ0.15), and between orienting and conflict (r ϭ 0.12) were not significant ( p values Ͼ 0.05). The correlation between conflict and mean RT was significant (r ϭ 0.49; p Ͻ 0.01). Figure 2 B shows the accuracy results. The overall accuracy was 90% (SD, 9%). The accuracy for each condition was 96% for no cue-congruent, 79% for no cue-incongruent, 96% for center cuecongruent, 81% for center cue-incongruent, 97% for spatial cuecongruent, and 89% for spatial cue-incongruent. The alerting, orienting, and conflict effects were Ϫ1% (SD, 4%), Ϫ4% (SD, 4%), and 13% (SD, 7%), respectively. ANOVA showed that the factor of cue level was significant (F (2,70) ϭ 37.18; p Ͻ 0.01), the factor of target condition (conflict effect) was significant (F (1,35) ϭ 117.09; p Ͻ 0.01), and the interaction between cue and target was significant (F (2,70) ϭ 29.82; p Ͻ 0.01). The alerting by conflict interaction was not significant (F (1,35) ϭ 1.84; p Ͼ 0.05); however, the orienting by conflict interaction was significant (F (1,35) ϭ 35.04; p Ͻ 0.01), indicating that the conflict was significantly less in the spatial cue than in the center cue condition. Simple comparisons showed that the alerting effect was not significant (F (1,35) ϭ 3.36; p ϭ 0.08), but orienting and conflict effects were significant (F (1,35) ϭ 36.24 and F (1,35) ϭ 119.07; p values Ͻ 0.01). The correlation between the alerting and orienting scores (r ϭ Ϫ0.47) was significant ( p Ͻ 0.01), possibly because the center cue condition was used in the calculation of both alerting and orienting scores. The correlation between alerting and conflict (r ϭ Ϫ0.13) was not significant ( p Ͼ 0.05), although the correlation between the orienting and conflict (r ϭ 0.69) was significant ( p Ͻ 0.01). Topographical maps and ERP waveforms Figure 3 shows the topographical map of the voltage distribution at 350, 225, 450, and 100 ms for alerting, orienting, and both target-and response-locked executive control effects, respectively, as difference waveforms. These time points were selected based on the latencies of the ERP peaks and maxima of power change for each network. To enhance the statistical power, the average waveforms of the E68 and surrounding electrodes (E60, E61, E62, E67, E73, E78, E79, E86) for alerting, E59 and surrounding electrodes (E51, E52, E58, E60, E65) for orienting, and E6 and surrounding electrodes (E5, E7, E12, E13, E107, E113) for target-locked and response-locked ERPs were averaged and compared between contrasting conditions in the averaged data of individual participants. The E68 and E59 electrodes were at the maxima of the topographical maps for alerting and orienting effects, respectively. The E6 and surrounding electrodes are from the medial-frontal channels, which have been shown to relate to error-related negativity (ERN) and theta-band ERP (Luu et al., 2004) . The p values for the t tests of the difference between two conditions were also shown for the periods of 300 -400 ms for alerting, 175-275 ms for orienting, 500 -600 ms for targetlocked, and 0 -200 for response-locked ERPs of executive control. The N2 component can be seen from the cue-and targetlocked, but not the response-locked responses. Time-frequency properties of attentional networks The dipole sources for alerting, orienting, and executive control target-and response-locked effects explained 86, 91, 92, and 83% variance, respectively, for the modeled periods of the grand average differential ERPs. Alerting network Figure 4 shows that alerting evoked changes in rhythmic power of the alerting network. The most noticeable finding is the decrease in theta-, alpha-, and beta-band (4 -30 Hz, centered at alphaband) power during 200 -450 ms after cue, which is seen throughout the entire alerting network except in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Fig. 4 , center cue column). There was an increase in theta activity in the right superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus (Fig. 4 , alerting effect column). The decrease of gamma-band activity found in the right superior temporal gyrus and other dipole sources comparing the center cue with no cue condition (Fig. 4 , alerting effect column) may be caused by both a significant gamma-band activity decrease under the center cue condition (as we can see from the center cue column of Fig. 4 , there is no significant gamma band activity decrease) and a gamma-band activity increase under the no cue condition related to overlap effects generated by other events. Grand-averaged source waveforms of the alerting network are provided for comparison; notice that each source has a unique waveform profile. Importantly, if one were to examine the ERPs exclusively, the cohesive nature of the theta-, alpha-, and beta-band power decrease within the alerting network would be obscured. Orienting network Figure 5 shows the time-frequency pattern of the orienting network. There was a specific increase in gamma-band power (30 -80 Hz) with some beta-band components ϳ200 ms after spatial cue onset (Fig. 5 , spatial cue column). This specific increase in gamma-band power was not elicited by the center cue condition (Fig. 5 , center cue column). For the spatial cue minus center cue contrast, the gamma-band power increase effect was most pronounced in the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, the right superior parietal lobule near the anterior intraparietal sulcus, the right postcentral gyrus, and the second region of the left precentral gyrus (BA4) (Fig. 5 , orienting effect column). The left superior frontal gyrus dipole source showed a different pattern with more 60 -80 Hz of gamma-band and low-frequency power (Ͻ30 Hz) activity increase. The second left precentral gyrus source (BA4) also showed a low-frequency power (Ͻ30 Hz) increase. The left precentral gyrus and left superior parietal lobule did not show significant gamma-band power change. Again, source waveforms from each source are presented for comparison. Although each source has a unique source waveform profile, all of them appeared to be very similar between the two cue types. Executive control network Examination of the time-frequency pattern of the executive control network in Figure 6 yielded several interesting findings. First, onset of targets with either incongruent or congruent flankers under no cue or center cue conditions evoked a strong increase in gamma-band (30 -90 Hz) power together with some frequency components of beta-band during the 100 -300 ms period after target onset, similar to the power change related to spatial cue in Figure 5 . This effect was most pronounced in the frontal dipole sources of the left superior frontal gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the left inferior frontal gyrus, and was also seen clearly in the left fusiform gyrus (Fig. 6 , no cue and center cue columns). When the participant was oriented by the spatial cue before the  onset of the target, the gamma-band activity was highly attenuated (Fig. 6 , spatial cue columns). This may indicate that the gammaband power increase found in these dipole sources during the target response in the executive control network is related to the orienting processing needed under no cue and center cue conditions after the target and flanker appears and is not specifically related to executive control. Second, for both target types there was a long-latency decrease in the power of frequencies Ͻ30 Hz centered at alphaband throughout most sources of the network. This is very similar to that as seen after presentation of center and spatial cues (Figs. 4, 5 ). The attenuated theta-, alpha-, and beta-band (Ͻ30 Hz) power change for the target response under center cue and spatial cue conditions compared with the no cue condition may indicate that the decrease in power of these bands found in Figure 6 is attributable mainly to the alerting function recruited for the target response when no cue proceeded the target. Finally, and most importantly, the main effect of conflict (incongruent minus congruent, the conflict effect column) showed a complex pattern. There were source-specific increases in gamma-band activity seen at early latency in some frontal dipole sources (right inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and right ACC; Ͻ400 ms), beta-and low gammaband (30 -60 Hz) power decreases during 400 -600 ms (which were close to the average RT of 580 ms and were most significant in right the inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus), decreases in beta-band power at late latency in the right middle frontal gyrus, and even lower bands of theta and alpha in other regions such as the left fusiform gyrus during 500 -700 ms. For the right inferior frontal gyrus, there was also an increase in theta-and alpha-band power before the response. The left inferior frontal gyrus source showed a more complex pattern with an increase in late-latency low (Ͻ20 Hz) and high (Ͼ80 Hz) band power. To the right of Figure 6 , source waveforms from each source are presented for comparison. There were small (the N2 component for the early latency) and nonsignificant differences (the P300 for the later 400 -600 ms component) between congruent and incongruent target conditions. We also found theta-and alpha-band power bursts after the button response in the right fusiform gyrus for the spatial cuecongruent target condition, which had an average RT of 500 ms. The complex patterns of the executive control effect from the dipole sources of the executive control network may also relate to the shifting of frequency components along the time axis under the incongruent condition for conflict processing. Based on these findings, we decided to investigate further by analyzing the response-locked power spectral changes. Figure 7 shows the complex pattern of results obtained from the response-locked analysis for the executive control network. Similar to the late power decreases found for the target-locked analysis (Fig. 6 ), there were broad-band power decreases before the responses made to targets accompanied by incongruent flankers compared with those with congruent flankers (Fig. 7 , conflict resolution column). There was also a gamma-band power increase in almost all sources typically after response. Consistent with the target-locked analysis, the theta burst after target response can be seen clearly from the right fusiform gyrus dipole source. The ACC and left superior frontal gyrus dipole sources showed the beta-band burst and increased gamma power after response. In summary, alerting was most accompanied by a decrease in theta-, alpha-, and beta-band activity after a warning signal (200 -450 ms). Orienting was associated with an increase in gammaband activity either after a cue (ϳ200 ms) indicating the target location or when a target requires a shift of attention to the target location. For the target-locked analysis, the conflict processing in the executive network involved an early (Ͻ400 ms) increase of a broad-band activity including gamma-band and a late (Ͼ 400 ms) decrease of a broad-band activity including theta-, alpha-, and low gamma-bands. For the response-locked analysis of conflict resolution, the decrease of broad-band activity, including theta-, alpha-, and low gamma-before response and theta-, beta-, and gammaband bursts near or after response, were also observed. Discussion Each of the three attentional networks appears to have a distinct pattern of synchronized frequency change. In the alerting network, the decrease in theta-, alpha-, and beta-band power corresponds to the usual desynchronization of electrical activity after a warning. One interpretation of this finding could be that the desynchronization occurs in response to any visual stimulus, and is not specific to alerting. However, the abrupt onset of any visual stimulus is known to attract attention (Yantis and Jonides, 1984) , therefore we may also interpret the standard alpha suppression effect to be related to attention. In this study, the reduction of activity was not just in the alpha band, but was much more broadly distributed in the frequency domain. The fact that cued target responses showed attenuated theta-, alpha-, and beta-band power reduction may provide support for the relationship between these frequency domains and the alerting function. The across-dipole desynchronization of theta-, alpha-, and beta-bands found in this study may indicate the involvement of thalamocortical circuits, including norepinephrine systems involved in alerting (Marrocco and Davidson, 1998 ). The norepinephrine system has been shown to be involved in general preparatory states. In our study, the decrease in theta-, alpha-, and beta-band power occurs ϳ200 ms after the warning in all of the cued conditions. This result indicates a mechanism such as alerting resulting from information that a target will occur, and suggests a relationship between these frequency bands and the alerting function. In addition, it may be useful to consider the distinction between sources and sites of the alerting network. The fusiform activity may be the site of origin and not part of the alerting network per se, and may be related to the fact that we just presented a stimulus in the visual modality or modulated by the sources of the alerting network (e.g., the thalamus). Evidence from cellular studies in monkeys indicates that attended targets induce changes in gamma-band activity in the visual cortex (Fries et al., 2001; Womelsdorf et al., 2006) . Previous ERP studies have shown enhancement of the P1 and N1 components of the ERP in areas of extrastriate visual cortex (Hillyard et al., 2004) . It has been argued that these visual effects involve orienting of attention and are orchestrated from the parietal and frontal cortices (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Hillyard et al., 2004) . Our study clearly shows gamma activity ϳ200 ms after a visual cue that indicated the presentation of a target, even before the target was actually presented. However, if no cue was present, gamma-band enhancement occurred ϳ200 ms after the target. The relative enhanced gamma oscillation in the fusiform gyrus, right superior parietal lobule, and some other regions related to orienting found in the present study is consistent with the study of attentional modulation of gamma-band oscillation found previously in the fusiform gyrus (Tallon-Baudry et al., 2005) and for attention to a moving stimulus (Gruber et al., 1999) . Together, these results and the present study suggest that gamma frequency enhancement arises as a result of the function of the orienting network. The executive control network showed an early increase in power in a broad range of frequencies, including gamma-band, after the presentation of targets with incongruent flankers compared with the presentation of targets with congruent flankers. This is consistent with previous studies on the time course of the electrical activity of the ACC (Snyder et al., 1995; Abdullaev and Posner, 1997) . The early latency gamma-band power increase in medial-frontal channels has been found to be related to the effect of attention on the integrative process (Herrmann et al., 1999; Senkowski et al., 2005) . The same phenomena observed in the ACC in the present study suggests that the ACC is involved in such an integrative process. The ACC and lateral prefrontal cortex are integral parts of the executive attention network. Many studies indicate that the ACC plays a major role involving response selection and monitoring (Botvinick et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2003) . In a study investigating the involvement of the ACC in action monitoring, the N2 component and ERN were modeled with a dipole located in the caudal ACC, with two additional dipoles in the left prefrontal region and the left superior parietal lobule to explain the later error positivity P E (Van Veen and Carter, 2002) . An EEG-fMRI combined study showed that ERN to false alarms relates to fMRI activation of caudal and rostral ACC, whereas N2 to correct rejections (conflict monitoring) correlated with fMRI activation of caudal ACC and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (Mathalon et al., 2003) . The time course of the preresponse theta-, beta-, and low gamma-band activity decrease and the postresponse theta-, beta-, and gamma-band bursts is also consistent with the time course of frontal midline theta bursts after correct speeded response (Makeig et al., 2004) , and after the ERN (Luu and Tucker, 2001; Luu et al., 2004) . It has been suggested that postresponse coherent theta activity is associated with cognitive function (Caplan et al., 2003) and might enhance the speed, salience, and reliability of spike-based communication between brain regions for context updating (Makeig et al., 2004) . Microelectrode recording has provided direct evidence for the task-related theta generation (Wang et al., 2005) . It has also been suggested that changes in alpha-and lower beta-band activity (8 -20 Hz) reflect specific attentional demands (Ray and Cole, 1985) . The increase in thetaband power after the response may also reflect the potential contribution of theta oscillations to long-range communications for cognitive processing by phase-locking to high gamma power (Canolty et al., 2006) . In this context, the increase in theta oscillations may be critical for postresponse cognitive processing and context updating between brain regions. Although the three attentional networks are separable, they do interact to optimize attentional performance. First, alerting improves the speed of target response (Fan et al., 2007) . It has been reported that there is a P300 amplitude enhancement if the cue predicts the cue-target interval (Miniussi et al., 1999) . Alerting involves enhancement of the N2 component followed by overlapping modulation of the P300 and contingent negative variation components (Nobre, 2001; Griffin et al., 2002) . The enhanced N2 component for 100% predictive novel stimulus facilitates target detection, whereas a novel stimuli with no predictive value generates increased novelty P3a and target P3b responses (Suwazono et al., 2000) . The gamma-band power increase and theta-, alpha-, and beta-band power decreases have a similar time course to the N2 and the P300 components. Second, the orienting function can reduce the conflict effect by focusing attention on the target to minimize the conflict generated by flankers or by reducing the resource requirement for orienting during the target response after the orienting cue. The gammaband activity for the target response after a spatial cue was dramatically attenuated. Therefore, the more efficient conflict processing for the spatial cue condition may relate to the reduction in need for gamma activity to perform orienting for the target response and conflict processing after a spatial cue. In a magnetoencephalography study of effects of spatialselective attention on oscillatory neuronal dynamics, the suppression of alpha, reduction of beta, and enhanced gamma-band oscillations were mapped onto the parieto-occipital, sensorimotor, and somatosensory cortices (Bauer et al., 2006) . The relationship between fMRI BOLD signal and frequency components supports the use of frequency analysis of ERP and EEG data to examine the temporal mechanisms of neural networks. A study of the relationship between the BOLD signal and underlying neuronal activity in the human auditory cortex showed a negative correlation between the BOLD signal and local field potentials in the low-frequency band (Ͻ30 Hz), but a positive correlation with the high-frequency band (Ͼ30 Hz) activity (Mukamel et al., 2005) . If these finding are applied to our current data, they suggest that the altered frequency operations that accompany orienting, alerting, and conflict processing would all be expected to produce increases in the BOLD signal. This expectation fits well with the results of alerting and orienting network, except that conflict processing involves a more complex pattern. The present study demonstrates the importance of examining power spectra in addition to ERPs to better understand the temporal characteristics of each attentional network. In some cases, the frequency band changes offer information that is not available from ERP components alone. For example, it has been shown that high-frequency components (e.g., gamma oscillation) do not contribute to the averaged evoked potentials (Liang et al., 2005) and that gamma oscillation and evoked potentials are not systematically colocalized (Tallon-Baudry et al., 2005) . We have circumvented this issue by using fMRI results to constrain dipole locations and by calculating average power changes from individual trials, rather than calculating power changes from averaged ERPs. Finally, the finding of characteristic time-frequency patterns for each attentional function along with evidence of a distinct anatomy (Fan et al., 2005) supports the separation of attentional functions into distinct networks and the association of specific attentional networks with specific oscillation patterns, although the networks clearly interact in the performance of many acts of attention. Figure 1 . 1 Figure1. Schematic of the ANT. A fixation cross appears in the center of the screen all of the time. In each trial, depending on the cue condition (no cue, center cue, or spatial cue), a cue may appear for 200 ms. After a variable duration (300 -1450 ms), the target (the center arrow) and flankers of two left and two right arrows (congruent or incongruent flankers) are presented. The participant makes a response to the target's direction within a time window of 2000 ms. The target and flankers disappear after the response is made. The target and post-target fixation period lasts for a variable duration (3000 -4200 ms). Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2.

INTRODUCTION Acetylcholine is a crucial neuromodulator of brain function. It originates predominantly from cholinergic neurons located in the basal forebrain, which also contains GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons (Gritti et al., 2006; Do et al., 2016) . As one of the most important and widely projecting neuromodulatory centers in the mammalian brain, the basal forebrain has been implicated in sensory perception, attention, arousal, and learning and memory (Herrero et al., 2008; Conner et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2011; Chubykin et al., 2013; Froemke et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014) . The olfactory system is an important sensory system for mammals, and olfactory centers such as the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex receive dense innervation from the basal forebrain (Luskin and Price, 1982; De Saint Jan, 2022) . Both cholinergic and GABAergic afferent fibers from the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB), a sub-region of the basal forebrain, form dense innervations with olfactory centers (Zaborszky et al., 1986; Villar et al., 2021; De Saint Jan, 2022) . For example, cholinergic axons innervate multiple layers of the olfactory bulb and acetylcholine receptors are widely expressed in the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex (Mechawar et al., 2004; Gomez et al., 2005; Saar et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2015; Case et al., 2017) . Similarly, HDB GABAergic inputs form functional connections with neurons in the olfactory bulb (Nunez-Parra et al., 2013; Sanz Diez et al., 2019) . Therefore, it is not unexpected that the cholinergic/GABAergic projections from the HDB to olfactory centers modulate olfactory processing and olfactory behaviors (Linster et al., 2001; de Almeida et al., 2013; Nunez-Parra et al., 2013; Rothermel et al., 2014; Chan et al., 2017; Cho and Linster, 2020) . Cholinergic modulation within the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex plays crucial roles in odor discrimination. Immunological lesions of HDB cholinergic neurons increase generalization between similar odors (Linster et al., 2001; Linster and Cleland, 2002) . Activation of the cholinergic system is beneficial for olfactory learning (Chaudhury et al., 2009; Chapuis and Wilson, 2013; Takahashi et al., 2021) , whereas pharmacological blockade of acetylcholine receptors in the olfactory bulb or the piriform cortex impairs acquisition of odor discrimination (Chaudhury et al., 2009; Chapuis and Wilson, 2013; Devore et al., 2014) . In addition, the inactivation of HDB GABAergic neurons impairs habituation/dishabituation (Nunez-Parra et al., 2013) . Therefore, both cholinergic and GABAergic projections are crucial for sensory processing and olfactory behaviors. However, how neural activity in HDB correlates with olfactory behaviors, especially whether and how cholinergic and GABAergic neurons are activated during different olfactory tasks remains largely unexplored. Interestingly, previous studies have also shown that basal forebrain neurons receive projections from multiple olfactory regions and can be modulated by electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb and cortex (Linster and Hasselmo, 2000; Zheng et al., 2018) , indicating the existence of both feedforward and feedback connections between the olfactory system and the basal forebrain. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake animals have further demonstrated the dynamic nature of HDB neural activity during associative olfactory discrimination learning: basal forebrain neurons are recruited slightly before trial initiation in successful discrimination trials (Nunez-Parra et al., 2020) and baseline neural activity in the HDB increases during the acquisition phase of an odor-reward association (Devore et al., 2016) . Both results indicate that basal forebrain neurons are involved in odor-associated learning. However, whether and how activity in HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons differs during odor-associated learning is unclear. In addition, although a recent study focusing on acetylcholine release in the HDB suggests that local cholinergic signaling is rapidly modulated during olfactory learning (Hanson et al., 2021) , how cholinergic activity correlates with the stages in an olfactory task remains elusive. In the present study, we addressed these questions by recording neural activity from cholinergic and GABAergic HDB neurons in mice undergoing passive odor exposure and odor-reward associative learning. Our data suggest that cholinergic and GABAergic neurons display distinct response dynamics during passive odor stimulation and olfactory learning, and play different roles in odor discrimination. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Male VGAT-Cre and C57BL/6J mice aged 10-16 weeks old were used. Mice were housed in groups and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum food and water except when mice were trained for the behavioral task, during which they were water restricted and allowed access to water to maintain >80% of their original weight. Mice were individually housed and allowed to recover from surgery for at least 2 weeks. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the Xuzhou Medical University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Virus Injection and Fiber Implant The surgical procedures have been described in our previous studies (Case et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019 Wang et al., , 2020 Wang et al., , 2022)) . For virus injection, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (i.p., 90 mg/kg) and head-fixed in a stereotactic frame (RWD, Shenzhen, China). After exposure, the skull was thinned and removed carefully in the targeted brain area. The AAV virus (BrainVTA, Wuhan, China) was delivered to the HDB (AP: 0.15 mm; lateral: 1.25 mm; DV: 5.58-5.63 mm) with a syringe pump (Stoelting Quintessential Injector) connected to a 10-15 µm diameter glass micropipette, at a rate of 40 nl/min. To record or inactivate cholinergic neurons, a total volume of 300 nl of virus [AAV-ChAT-Cre and either AAV-axon-DIO-GCaMP6s/AAV-DIO-EGFP or AAV-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry/AAV-DIO-mCherry, in a 1:2 mixture] was injected into the HDB of C57BL/6J mice. To record or inactivate GABAergic neurons, 300 nl of AAV-DIO-axon-GCaMP6s/AAV-DIO-EGFP or AAV-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry/AAV-DIO-mCherry was injected into the HDB of VGAT-Cre mice. After viral delivery, the glass pipette was left in place for an additional 10 min before being slowly withdrawn. For the chemogenetic experiments, the incision was sutured after the virus injection. For fiber photometry recordings, an optical fiber [0.37 numerical aperture (NA), 200-µm diameter; Newdoon, Hangzhou, China] was implanted in the HDB after the virus injection at the same coordinates and fixed to the skull with cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic alongside with a custom-made aluminum headplate to allow head-fixation. Mice were then treated with lincomycin hydrochloride and lidocaine hydrochloride gel to alleviate inflammation and pain, housed individually, and allowed to recover and virus expression for at least 2 weeks. After the behavioral tests, mice were sacrificed for standard histology to confirm virus injection and fiber placement. Immunohistochemistry To verify viral expression, frozen brain sections containing the HDB were prepared. The mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (i.p., 90 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 20 ml saline (0.9%), and then with 20 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PB (0.1 M, pH 7.4). After perfusion, brains were harvested, postfixed in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 • C, and then were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PB until the tissue sank. Brain tissue was then embedded in an OCT compound and sectioned into 30 µm slices with a vibratome (Leica Inc). Coronal brain slices containing the HDB were mounted onto microscope slides and incubated with a blocking solution (10% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Next, the sections were incubated with the primary antibody (goat anti-ChAT, 1:300, AB144P, Sigma-Aldrich) which was diluted in a blocking solution for 48 h at 4 • C. After washout of primary antibodies, the sections were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody, 1:500, A-11058, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the sections were incubated with DAPI for nuclear staining, coverslipped with a 50% glycerol mounting medium, and imaged with a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM710). Fiber Photometry The C57L/6J mice (injected with AAV-ChAT-Cre and AAVaxon-DIO-GCaMP6s/AAV-DIO-EGFP) or VGAT-Cre mice (injected with AAV-axon-DIO-GCaMP6s/AAV-DIO-EGFP) implanted with an optical fiber were head-fixed on an air-supported free-floating Styrofoam ball. The GCaMP6s signals during passive odor exposure and the behavioral tasks were monitored with a fiber photometry system (Thinkerbiotech, Nanjing, China) using methods similar to our previous studies (Wang et al., 2019 (Wang et al., , 2022)) . A dichroic mirror (MD498, Thorlabs) reflected a laser beam from a 488-nm laser (OBIS 488LS, Coherent) which focused through an objective lens (10× NA: 0.3; Olympus), and then coupled to an optical commutator (Doric Lenses). An input cable (200-mm o.d., NA:0.37, 1.5-m long) was connected to the implanted optical fiber and the laser power at the tip of the optical fiber was set to 50 µW. GCaMP6s fluorescence emissions were detected by a photomultiplier tube (R3896, Hamamatsu) after being bandpass filtered (MF525-39, Thorlabs). The photomultiplier tube current output was converted to a voltage by an amplifier (C7319, Hamamatsu) and was further filtered through a low-pass filter (35 Hz cutoff; Brownlee, 440). The analog voltage signals were then digitized at 500 Hz and recorded by fiber photometry software. To exclude that the cholinergic and GABAergic signals observed in mice expressing GCaMP6s were not motion artifacts, we also used a fiber photometry system with two excitation wavelengths, the calcium-dependent excitation wavelength (470 nm) and the calcium-independent isosbestic wavelength (580 nm). Odor Delivery An odor delivery system (Thinkerbiotech, Nanjing, China) was used to deliver odors (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, Shanghai, China) which were dissolved in mineral oil at 1% (v/v) dilution. A stream of charcoal-filtered air flowed over the odor which was then diluted to 1/20 by an olfactometer. The duration of odor presentation was 2 s in each trial and the inter-trial interval was 30 s. The odor presentation was synchronously controlled by the data acquisition system via a solenoid valve driven by a digital-to-analog converter and air was delivered to the mouse at a constant rate of 1 l/min to eliminate the effect of airflow. The temporal information of the odor delivery system was tested by a mini photo-ionization detector (PID, Aurora Scientific, Canada). The latency from the odor trigger to 10% PID maximum was around 50 ms, the rise time from 10% to 90% PID maximum was around 130 ms, and the time to return to 10% PID maximum after trigger offset (decline) was around 100 ms. Eight odors were used during passive odor exposure: isoamyl acetate, 2-heptanone, phenyl acetate, benzaldehyde, dimethyl butyric acid, n-heptane acid, n-pentanol, and 2-pentanone. Overview of Training and Behavioral Tasks The animal training and behavioral tasks were carried out using methods similar to our previous studies (Wang et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022) . For fiber photometry recordings, head-fixed mice were trained on an air-supported free-floating Styrofoam ball which allowed the mice to maneuver. Mice were water restricted for 2-3 days before behavioral training (a go/go task and a go/no-go task). The body weight of the training mouse was monitored daily and maintained at 80%-85% of its initial weight. Mice performed daily sessions of the behavioral task, with each session consisting of 120 trials. Two odor pairs (isoamyl acetate vs. 2-heptanone and phenyl acetate vs. benzaldehyde) were used during the behavioral tasks. One of the two odors was pseudorandomly delivered (maximum of two trials in a row with the same odor) on each trial which consisted of a 2-s odorant delivery period, followed by a 1-s answer period, during which the mouse could choose whether or not to lick the lick spout. Mice were first trained to lick the water spout for reward and then were trained to get water reward only during odor presentation (the go/go task). During the go/go task, the mice were rewarded by licking the water spout during the answer period when either of the odors was delivered. The water release was triggered by licking measured by a pair of infrared photobeams 0.5 s before the end of the S+ presentation. The mouse would get the water reward for 1 s and the water release would be turned off by an electromagnetic valve, ensuring that the mouse can only access water for 1 s. Next, the mice were trained to perform a go/nogo task in which they learned to discriminate the reinforced odor (S+) from the unreinforced odor (S-) to receive the water reward. In this task, mice learned to lick the water spout in go trials (S+ trials) and withhold licking in no-go trials (S-trials). Thus, in go trials, mice would get a water reward by licking (Hit), otherwise the trial would be classed as a Miss (no water reward was delivered). In no-go trials, water was never delivered regardless of whether they licked (false alarm, FA) or correctly refrained from licking during the odor (S-) presentation (correct rejection, CR). Hits and CRs were classed as correct responses and Misses and FAs were classed as wrong responses upon which a 10-s timeout punishment was introduced. Behavioral performance was evaluated in blocks of 20 trials (10 S+ and 10 Strials presented at random), and each session included 10 blocks. The percentage correct value for each block was calculated and mice were trained to achieve a performance criterion of ≥80% correct for two consecutive blocks. The GCaMP6s signals were recorded simultaneously throughout the whole behavioral task. For chemogenetic experiments, the behavioral tasks were performed in freely moving mice under the same training protocols. Mice were injected daily with saline or CNO (i.p., 3.3 mg/kg) 40 min before the training started. The trial was initiated by the training mouse entering the odor port and breaking a photodiode beam. Behavioral performance was evaluated in each session (day) which included 140-160 trials. During the easy task, isoamyl acetate (0.01%) and 2-heptanone (0.01%) were used as the S+ and the S-. In the difficult task, a 6:4 combination of isoamyl acetate (0.01%) and 2-heptanone (0.01%) was used as the S+ and a 4:6 combination of isoamyl acetate (0.01%) and 2-heptanone (0.01%) was used as the S-. Electrophysiological Recordings Brain Slice Preparation C57BL/6J and VGAT-Cre mice injected with AAVs in the HDB were used to test the responses of neurons expressing hM4D(Gi) to CNO perfusion. Mice anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (i.p., 90 mg/kg) were subjected to cardiac perfusion with ice-cold dissection buffer saturated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 containing (in mM): 85 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 25 NaHCO 3 , 25 glucose, 75 sucrose, 0.5 CaCl 2 , and 4 MgCl 2 . The brain was subsequently removed and slowly sliced with a vibratome (VT 1200S; Leica Inc.). Coronal brain slices containing the HDB (350 µm) were recovered at 37 • C for 60 min in a chamber filled with oxygenated artificial CSF (ACSF) containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2.5 CaCl 2 , 1.3 MgCl 2 , 1.3 NaHCO 3 , and 10 glucose, equilibrated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . One hour later, the holding chamber with slices was placed at room temperature and the slices were ready for patch-clamp recordings. Patch-Clamp Recordings Electrophysiological experiments were performed using the protocol described in our previous work (Wang et al., 2020 (Wang et al., , 2022)) . In brief, slices were transferred to a recording chamber and carbogen-saturated ACSF was perfused constantly at a flow rate of 2-3 ml/min at room temperature. The HDB in coronal brain slices was identified by visualizing the slices through a 60× waterimmersion objective under near-infrared DIC illumination with an upright microscope (ECLIPSE FN1, Nikon) equipped with wide-field fluorescence to identify fluorescently labeled (Gi-mCherry) neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), a Digidata 1440 A analog-to-digital converter (Molecular Devices), and pClamp 10.4 software (Molecular Devices). Voltage traces were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Recording electrodes had a resistance of 4-6 M when filled with an intrapipette solution containing (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.1 GTP, and 5 EGTA, 300 mOsm, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH. All drugs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices) and the ''event detection feature'' was used to analyze the frequency of action potentials. Statistical Analyses Behavioral Performance For the go/no-go task, the correct value in each block was calculated as: (number of Hit trials + number of CR trials)/total number of trials. The performance on S+ trials was calculated as number of Hit trials/(number of Hit trials + number of Miss trials). The performance on S-trials was calculated as number of CR trials/(number of FA trials + number of CR trials). Analysis of Fiber Photometry Data Data were exported as MATLAB .mat files and segmented according to the onset of odor stimulation on individual trials. We derived the values of fluorescence change (∆F/F) by calculating (F -F 0 )/F 0 , where F 0 is the baseline fluorescence signal averaged over a 5-s-long control time window, which preceded the onset of odor stimulation. ∆F/Fs are presented as heat maps or trial-averaged traces. Averaged ∆F/F value for 4 s from the onset of odor deliverywas quantified as the area under the peak (the area under the curve, AUC). ROC Analysis We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess the classification of the responses evoked by two odors within an odor pair (Gadziola et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019) . ROCs were estimated using the ROC function from the MATLAB exchange. The area under the ROC (auROC) is a nonparametric measure of the discriminability of two distributions. The area under the ROC curve was defined as ranging from 0.5 to 1.0. A value of 0.5 indicates completely overlapping distributions, whereas a value of 1.0 indicates perfect discriminability. Calculation of Differences in ∆F/F We used the difference in ∆F/F to assess the extent of the divergence in the responses during the go/no-go and go/go tasks. In the go/no-go task, the responses in S+ trials and S-trials were defined as Res S+ and Res S-, respectively. The difference in ∆F/F was calculated as follows: ABS (Res S+ -Res S-)/[ABS (Res S+) + ABS (Res S-)], where ABS represents the absolute value. Similarly, in the go/go task, the responses in odor A trials and odor B trials were defined as Res A and Res B, respectively. The difference in ∆F/F was calculated as follows: ABS (Res A -Res B)/[ABS (Res A) + ABS (Res B)]. Statistical Tests All statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the data. We used two-way ANOVA, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and paired t-test; all tests were two-sided. All data in the study are presented as the mean ± SEM. RESULTS Both Cholinergic and GABAergic Responses Decrease Over Time With Repeated Odor Exposure GCaMP6s signals of cholinergic/GABAergic HDB neurons were monitored by fiber photometry in awake, head-fixed mice. GCaMP6s expression was genetically restricted to cholinergic neurons by injecting a composite virus solution (AAV-ChAT-Cre and AAV-DIO-axon-GCaMP6s) into the HDB in C57BL/6J mice (Figures 1A, B ). Similarly, VGAT-Cre mice injected with AAV-DIO-axon-GCaMP6s were used to record Ca 2+ signals in HDB GABAergic neurons (Figures 1C, D ). First, we characterized the population response of cholinergic/GABAergic neurons in awake, head-fixed mice during passive odor exposure. The animals were exposed to a 2-s pulse of odor stimulation for 120 successive trials. Both cholinergic/GABAergic neurons displayed a rapid increase in the Ca 2+ signal upon odor delivery. However, the responses decreased as the trials progressed (Figures 1E, F, I, J ). We compared the averaged ∆F/F for the first three trials with that for the last three and found that the ∆F/F was significantly lower at the end of the experiment (Figures 1G, K ; G: paired t-test, P = 8.9 × 10 -4 ; K: paired ttest, P = 0.001). Decreased responses were also observed for other odors (Figures 1H, L ; H 1 : paired t-test, P = 6.8 × 10 -5 ; H 2 : paired t-test, P = 0.012; H 3 : paired t-test, P = 0.0023; L 1 : Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.0044; L 2 : Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.0033; L 3 : paired t-test, P = 0.0049). Similar results were obtained when we compared the averaged ∆F/F for the first five trials with that for the last five trials (Supplementary Figures 1A, B ; A: Isoamyl acetate, paired ttest, P = 0.0019; 2-Heptanone, paired t-test, P = 7.57 × 10 -5 . B: Isoamyl acetate, paired t-test, P = 0.0010; 2-Heptanone, paired t-test, P = 0.0076). We used mice that expressed EGFP in HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons as a control, which did not show any changes in fluorescence during passive odor exposure (Figures 2A, B ). In addition, we also used a second fluorescent channel (580 nm) as a control. We found that while odor evoked strong responses in the targeted recording channel, almost no responses were found in the control channel (Figures 2C, D ). These results suggest that the cholinergic and GABAergic signals observed in mice expressing GCaMP6s were not motion artifacts. All these results suggest that cholinergic and GABAergic HDB neurons display decreased responses to odors during repeated passive exposure. Responses of Cholinergic Neurons Remain Stable During Olfactory Associative Learning Previous studies have shown that cholinergic neurons are recruited during associative learning (Devore et al., 2016; Nunez-Parra et al., 2020) . Thus, we next examined the response profiles of HDB cholinergic neurons during olfactory associative learning (Figure 3A ). Mice were trained to learn a go/go task in which they could receive the water reward by licking the water spout within a defined time window after odor presentation (Figure 3B ). We recorded Ca 2+ signals from cholinergic/GABAergic neurons during a 120-trial session in animals proficient in the go/go task and compared the average ∆F/F from the first three trials with that from the last three trials (Figures 3C, F ). Interestingly, while GABAergic neurons showed decreased responses in the late stage of the session (Figures 3G, H ; H: paired t-test, P = 0.0042), the responses of cholinergic neurons were relatively stable across the session (Figures 3D, E ; E: paired t-test, P = 0.11). Similar results were obtained when we compared the averaged ∆F/F for the first 10 trials with that for the last 10 trials (Supplementary Figures 1C, D ; C: Isoamyl acetate, paired t-test, P = 0.14; 2-Heptanone, paired t-test, P = 0.51. D: Isoamyl acetate, paired t-test, P = 0.0066; 2-Heptanone, paired t-test, P = 0.012). These results indicate that the responses of HDB cholinergic neurons may reflect attention to rewarded odors during olfactory associative learning. The different odor response properties between cholinergic and GABAergic neurons might be due to the difference in bleaching of the marker protein. To exclude this possibility, we analyzed the baseline Ca 2+ fluorescence change during a session (120 trials). We found that both cholinergic and GABAergic fluorescence decreased slightly, which might be resulted from the bleaching of the marker protein. However, there was no significant difference between the baseline cholinergic and GABAergic fluorescence (Supplementary Figure 2A ). Further analysis indicated that both the cholinergic and GABAergic fluorescence was negatively correlated with the trial numbers, whereas there was no significant difference between the two groups (Supplementary Figure 2B ; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.31). Thus, the different response properties between cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the go/go task were not due to the difference in bleaching. Cholinergic Neurons Develop Separated Responses to the S+ and S-During Odor Discrimination Learning Our data suggest that the responses of cholinergic neurons to odor presentation decrease with repeated passive odor exposure but remain stable when attention is required to obtain a reward, raising the question of whether cholinergic neurons might respond differently to rewarded trials vs. unrewarded trials during an odor-discrimination task. To address this question, we recorded the responses of HDB cholinergic neurons while head-restrained mice learned to respond differently to odors in a go/no-go odor discrimination task (Figure 4A ; see also ''Materials and Methods'' Section). Thirsty mice were trained to lick the water spout for reward upon a rewarded odor (S+) presentation and refrain from licking upon an unrewarded odor presentation (Figure 4B ). The possible behavioral responses were Hit, correct rejection (CR), false alarm (FA), and miss (Figure 4C ). The behavioral performance was assessed by calculating the percentage of correct responses to the S+ and S-odors in blocks of 20 trials in which 10 S+ and 10 Sodors were delivered randomly. The learning curve across all trained mice is shown in Figure 4D . The behavioral performance of mice improved from near chance levels (50% correct) in Block 1 to well above the learning threshold (80% correct) in Block 10. Figure 4E shows the responses of cholinergic neurons for a representative mouse learning to discriminate between the S+ and S-. The traces were sorted into trials where the mouse was beginning to differentiate the odors (left, the first block) and trials where the mouse was proficient in discriminating the odors (right, the block with the highest correct rate, the best block). We found that the neural responses to S+ trials and S-trials were similar during the first block. However, the responses diverged once the mouse had learned the go/no-go task (Figure 4E ). To compare the classification of the responses during S+ trials and S-trials, we performed an ROC analysis. For the example shown in Figure 4E , the auROC, representing the difference in responses to S+ trials and S-trials, was larger in the best block than in the first block (Figure 4F , the first block: 0.56, the best block: 0.88), indicating that discriminability of the responses in S+ trials and S-trials was improved after the mouse learned the go/no-go task. Increased auROCs after mice learned the task were observed across all animals (Figures 4G-I ; I: paired t-test, P = 0.0067, n = 16 animal-odor pairs from eight mice). To quantify the extent of the response difference between S+ trials and S-trials, we calculated the difference in averaged ∆F/F between 0 and 4 s. Consistent with the results from the auROC analysis, the difference in averaged ∆F/F was larger in the best block than in the first block (Figure 4J , paired t-test, P = 0.0095). Both the results of auROC analysis and the difference in averaged ∆F/F demonstrated that the responses in S+ trials and S-trials became separated once mice were proficient in the go/no-go task. We then examined whether there was a correlation between the correct rates (in each block) and auROCs of cholinergic responses during the go/no-go task. The results showed that the auROCs were positively correlated with learning accuracy (Figure 4K ; linear regression, r = 0.35, P = 0.0029), indicating that cholinergic responses in S+ trials and S-trials tend to diverge with higher learning accuracy. The similarity of the cholinergic response in S+ trials and S-trials at the beginning of the go/no-go task may be because the animals pay attention during both types of trials when they have not yet learned to discriminate between the S+ and S-. Once the mice have learned the go/no-go task, they may pay more attention to S+ trials than to S-trials, presenting divergent responses to S+ trials and S-trials. In the go/no-go task, the behavioral responses on most of the trials were Hit, CR, or FA, with very few Miss trials (12/1,394, 0.86%). When we compared cholinergic responses in Hit, CR, and FA trials across the session (Figure 4L ), we found that the responses in Hit and FA trials were significantly larger than the responses in CR trials (Figure 4M ; Hit vs. CR: Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.012; FA vs. CR: paired t-test, P = 0.038). The smaller cholinergic responses in CR trials may be because the animals have learned to ignore the S-(CR trials) and pay attention to the S+ (Hit trials); before the mice have not learned the task, they presumably pay attention to both the S-(FA trials) and the S+ (Hit trials). Therefore, these data suggest that responses in HDB cholinergic neurons tend to be larger in trials during which the animals need to pay attention. In the go/go and go/no-go tasks, odor delivery was usually followed by licking, this raises the possibility that the odor responses may be caused or affected by licking during the odor stimulation. We thus analyzed the lick signals and fluorescence signals in the go/go and go/no-go tasks. In the go/go task, we found that fluorescence signals were always earlier than lick signals (Supplementary Figures 3A-C ), indicating that fluorescence signals can be independent of licking signals. Importantly, in the go/no-go task, there were almost no lick signals in CR trials, and there were very strong fluorescence responses (Supplementary Figure 3D ). Also, for both Hit and FA trials, the fluorescent signals increased before the lick onset, and the latency from odor onset to 50% peak of the ∆F/F in odor-locked was significantly different from that in lick-locked (Supplementary Figures 3B, C, E, F ; B: paired t-test, P = 0.0012; C: Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.0012; E: paired t-test, P = 1.51 × 10 -6 ; F: paired t-test, P = 2.21 × 10 -4 ). All these results suggest that the odor response recorded by fiber photometry in the present study is independent of licking and the separated cholinergic responses to S+ trials and S-trials are not contributed by licking. In the go/no-go task, we compared cholinergic responses in the first block and in the best block; however, the animals were in different behavioral states, e.g., thirst, during these two periods. To exclude the possibility that the responses to S+ trials and S-trials differed between the first block and the best block because of general behavioral state differences, we compared cholinergic responses in the first block and the last block during the go/go task, in which animals also received water and became satiated. The responses in the odor A and odor B trials were similar during both the first block and the last block in a representative mouse (Figures 5A, B ; auROC: the first block, 0.41; the last block, 0.52). Further analysis indicated that neither the auROC values nor the difference in ∆F/F across all animal-odor pairs were significantly different between the first block and the last block during the go/go task (Figures 5C-F ; E: Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.16; F: paired t-test, P = 0.61, n = 16 animal-odor pairs from eight mice), indicating no separated responses were found in the go/go task. Therefore, the divergent responses of S+ and S-trials in HDB cholinergic neurons likely reflect changes in attention across the session, as opposed to changes in behavioral states such as thirst. GABAergic Neurons Have Similar Responses to the S+ and S-During Odor Discrimination Learning Next, we examined the responses of HDB GABAergic neurons during the go/no-go task. Figure 6A shows that all mice learned to discriminate odors successfully. The response of GABAergic neurons in S+ trials and S-trials was similar both during the first block and during the best block in a representative mouse (Figures 6B, C ; auROC: the first block, 0.5; the best block, 0.46). Further analysis indicated that neither the auROC value nor the difference in ∆F/F across all animal-odor pairs was significantly different between the first block and the best block during the go/no-go task (Figures 6D-G ; F: paired ttest, P = 0.13; G: paired t-test, P = 0.91, n = 26 animal-odor pairs from 13 mice), indicating that the separated responses in S+ trials and S-trials were not found in HDB GABAergic neurons. In addition, no correlation between accuracy and auROCs was observed in GABAergic responses (Figure 6H , linear regression, r = 0.13, P = 0.19). We also compared GABAergic responses in Hit, CR, and FA trials across the session (Figure 6I ) and found that the responses in Hit and FA trials were not significantly different from that in CR trials (Figure 6J ; Hit vs. CR: paired t-test, P = 0.44; FA vs. CR: Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.97). Therefore, these data indicate that, unlike the responses of cholinergic neurons, the responses of GABAergic neurons to the S+ and S-do not separate after mice have learned the odor-discrimination task. We also analyzed the lick signals and GABAergic fluorescence signals in the go/go and go/no-go tasks (Supplementary Figure 4 ), and the results indicate that the odor-evoked GABAergic response recorded by fiber photometry is independent of licking. Inactivation of HDB Cholinergic Neurons Impairs Odor Discrimination The above results suggest that HDB cholinergic neurons may play an important role in odor discrimination. This prompted us to explore the influence of cholinergic neuron dysfunction on odor discrimination. We injected a composite virus solution [AAV-ChAT-Cre and AAV2/9-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry/AAV2/9-DIO-mCherry] into the bilateral HDB of C57BL/6J mice (Figure 7A ). Four weeks after virus injection, hM4D(Gi)-mCherry expression was observed in the HDB (Figure 7B ). Then we tested the effect of clozapine N-oxide (CNO) on the activity of cholinergic neurons expressing hM4D(Gi) in vitro (Figure 7C ). Perfusion of CNO (10 µM) significantly decreased the membrane potential and the frequency of action potentials (Figure 7D ; ∆Vm: paired ttest, P = 0.0018; Frequency: paired t-test, P = 0.0077). To explore the influence of cholinergic neurons' inactivation on odor discrimination, we conducted an odor discrimination assay that lasted for 9 days, including the training period (2 days), the easy task (3 days), and the difficult task (4 days) in freely moving mice. As in our previous study (Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022) , mice were first trained to undergo a go/go task, then the mice were trained to perform a go/no-go task, including the easy task (S+: isoamyl acetate; S-: 2-heptanone) and a difficult task (S+: isoamyl acetate: 2-heptanone = 6:4; S-: 2-heptanone: isoamyl acetate = 6:4; Figure 7E ). The percent correct rate during the go/no-go task was compared between experimental (Gi + CNO) and control (Gi + saline, mCherry + CNO) animals. Mice were injected daily with saline or CNO (i.p., 3.3 mg/kg) 40 min before the training started. We found that the experimental mice could not learn to discriminate between the S+ and S-, even in the easy task: the percent correct rate was significantly lower in experimental mice than in control mice both in the easy task and in the difficult task (Figure 7F ; easy task: two-way ANOVA, Gi + saline vs. Gi + CNO, P < 1 × 10 -4 , mCherry + CNO vs. Gi + CNO, P =1 × 10 -4 , Gi + saline vs. mCherry + CNO, P = 0.81; difficult task: two-way ANOVA, Gi + saline vs. Gi + CNO, P < 1 × 10 -4 , mCherry + CNO vs. Gi + CNO, P < 1 × 10 -4 , Gi + saline vs. mCherry + CNO, P = 0.83). Further analysis indicated that while reductions in correct responses in both S+ and S-trials were responsible for the impaired odor discrimination in experimental mice during the easy task, impaired performance during the difficult task was caused by a reduction in correct responses in S-trials only (Figures 7G, H ; G: Easy task: two-way ANOVA, Gi + saline vs. Gi + CNO, P = 4 × 10 -4 , mCherry + CNO vs. Gi + CNO, P = 0.0082, Gi + saline vs. mCherry + CNO, P = 0.99; Difficult task: two-way ANOVA, Gi + saline vs. Gi + CNO, P = 0.65, mCherry + CNO vs. Gi + CNO, P = 0.41, Gi + saline vs. mCherry + CNO, P = 0.83; H: Easy task: two-way ANOVA, Gi + saline vs. Gi + CNO, P = 2 × 10 -4 , mCherry + CNO vs. Gi + CNO, P = 4 × 10 -4 , Gi + saline vs. mCherry + CNO, P = 0.81; Difficult task: two-way ANOVA, Gi + saline vs. Gi + CNO, P < 1 × 10 -4 , mCherry + CNO vs. Gi + CNO, P < 1 × 10 -4 , Gi + saline vs. mCherry + CNO, P = 0.92). The differences in percent correct rates were not due to distinct training intensity because the numbers of training trials between experimental and control mice were not significantly different (Figure 7I , Difficult task: two-way ANOVA, P = 0.40). These results indicate that the inactivation of HDB cholinergic neurons impairs odor discrimination. Inactivation of HDB GABAergic Neurons Has No Effect on Odor Discrimination We next examined whether the inactivation of HDB GABAergic neurons affects odor discrimination behavior. We injected AAV2/9-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry/AAV2/9-DIO-mCherry into the bilateral HDB of VGAT-Cre mice (Figure 8A ). Four weeks after virus injection, hM4D(Gi)-mCherry expression was observed in the HDB (Figure 8B ). Then we tested the effect of CNO on the activity of GABAergic neurons expressing hM4D(Gi) in vitro (Figure 8C ). Perfusion of CNO (10 µM) significantly decreased the membrane potential and the frequency of action-potentials (Figure 8D ; ∆Vm: Wilcoxon's sign rank test, P = 0.018; Frequency: paired t-test, P = 0.003). We trained the mice on the go/no-go task and found that the percent correct rates were not significantly different between the experimental mice and the control mice (Figure 8E ; easy task: two-way ANOVA, P = 0.54; difficult task: two-way ANOVA, P = 0.26). These results indicate that, unlike inactivation of HDB cholinergic neurons, inactivation of HDB GABAergic neurons had no effect on odor discrimination behavior. DISCUSSION Both cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the HDB send long-distance projections to modulate the neural activity and function of other brain areas (Do et al., 2016; Villar et al., 2021; De Saint Jan, 2022) . Although the modulatory effects of these two projections on the olfactory system have been intensively studied (Fletcher and Chen, 2010; Ma and Luo, 2012; Nunez-Parra et al., 2013) , a comparison of the odor responses and function of these two projections during different behavioral states is still lacking. Here we used fiber photometry to demonstrate that HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons display distinct response dynamics during odor discrimination learning. While both cholinergic and GABAergic responses decreased over time upon repeated passive odor exposure, they displayed different patterns during odor-association learning: during a go/go task, responses in cholinergic neurons remained stable whereas responses in GABAergic neurons decreased as the session progressed, as they did during passive exposure. Moreover, during a go/no-go odor discrimination task, the responses of cholinergic neurons to the S+ and S-separated once the mice learned to discriminate the two odors correctly. Chemogenetic inactivation of HDB cholinergic neurons impaired odor discrimination learning but inactivation of HDB GABAergic neurons did not. Together, these results suggest that HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons are activated differently and may play distinct roles in odor-association learning. The increased Ca 2+ signal in HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons upon passive odor exposure likely derives from the feedforward connections between olfactory regions and the basal forebrain. Basal forebrain neurons are innervated by several olfactory regions, and c-fos expression in the basal forebrain increases upon odor exposure (Zheng et al., 2018) . Moreover, electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb and cortex modulates  neural activity in the HDB (Linster and Hasselmo, 2000) . However, whether and how basal forebrain neurons are modulated during passive exposure, especially at the beginning of odor delivery, was previously unknown. Similarly, decreased feedforward input from olfactory regions to the basal forebrain may be responsible for the decreased responses in cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the late trials of experiments with repeated exposure to odors. Odor habituation is observed in the olfactory system, especially in the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex (Wilson, 1998; Twick et al., 2014; Ogg et al., 2015; Mignot et al., 2021) , and the decreased response in HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons after repeated odor exposure may reflect decreased input from these olfactory centers. However, the reverse may also be true. The decreased responses may reflect direct changes in HDB neural activity during passive exposure: HDB neurons may be activated at the beginning of odor exposure as mice pay attention to the novel odor and no longer be activated when the odors become familiar. Via feedback connections, the reduction in HDB neural activity may account for odor habituation in olfactory centers such as the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex. Indeed, it has been reported that basal forebrain neurons can signal novelty (Sun et al., 2019) , dishabituate odor responses, and reinstate odor investigation (Ogg et al., 2018) . Higher c-fos levels are observed in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons after olfactory learning (Zheng et al., 2018) . Importantly, the basal forebrain neurons are recruited and display higher neural activity during reward association (Devore et al., 2016; Nunez-Parra et al., 2020) . Therefore, higher rates of neural activity during odor associative learning may be responsible for the stable responses of HDB cholinergic neurons throughout the go/go task. On the other hand, GABAergic responses decayed rapidly toward the end of the go/go task, indicating that HDB GABAergic neurons may not be activated during reward learning. Thus, the distinct dynamics in cholinergic and GABAergic neurons resulting from different neural activity states may explain why the responses in cholinergic neurons remained stable but the responses in GABAergic neurons decreased over time. Differing levels of activity have been previously reported for basal forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons: whereas cholinergic neurons were consistently excited during reward association in a go/no-go auditory discrimination task, GABAergic neurons exhibited diverse responses (Harrison et al., 2016) . However, further investigation is required to examine how HDB cholinergic neurons respond to odor vs. reward, and during which task period these neurons play an important role. The possibility that the odor response of cholinergic neurons is shaped by attention is further supported by results from the go/no-go experiment, during which these neurons showed divergent responses to the rewarded odor (S+) and the unrewarded odor (S-) after the mice had learned the odor discrimination task. The faster decay of responses during S-trials may reflect reduced attention to the unrewarded cue in proficient mice. Conversely, the cholinergic responses to the S+ and S-were similar during the learning phase, when the mice had not learned to discriminate between the two odors and attention to both stimuli was necessary. Electrophysiology and fiber photometry recordings have shown that odor-evoked responses in the olfactory bulb diverge after learning and that mitral/tufted neurons carry information about odor value (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Wang et al., 2019) . This neural representation strategy is likely shaped by top-down innervations, such as the noradrenergic (Yamada et al., 2017; Ramirez-Gordillo et al., 2018) and serotonergic (unpublished data) inputs to the olfactory bulb. However, since separated responses were also observed in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the present study, it is important to investigate whether and how HDB cholinergic inputs also contribute to odor representation in the olfactory bulb during odor discrimination. Many studies have investigated the function of HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in olfaction. Selective lesion of cholinergic neurons that project to the OB, inactivation of cholinergic neurons, and pharmacological blockade of acetylcholine receptors all decrease performance in some olfactory behaviors, including olfactory habituation, perceptual generalization, and odor discrimination (Linster et al., 2001; Linster and Cleland, 2002; Smith et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2017; Ross et al., 2019) , and activation of the cholinergic system is beneficial for olfactory behaviors (Ma and Luo, 2012; Cho and Linster, 2020; Takahashi et al., 2021) . Compared with cholinergic modulation, GABAergic regulation of olfactory behavior has been less studied. Disruption of GABAergic afferents from the basal forebrain impairs habituation/dishabituation behavior (Nunez-Parra et al., 2013) and several studies have implicated basal forebrain GABAergic projections in neural activity and olfactory processing in the olfactory bulb (Hanson et al., 2020; Villar et al., 2021; Zhou and Puche, 2021; De Saint Jan, 2022) . Together, these studies indicate that both cholinergic and GABAergic projections are crucial for sensory processing and olfactory learning. However, in the present study, although we found that cholinergic neurons play an important role in odor discrimination, GABAergic neurons may not be involved in this type of associative learning. HDB GABAergic responses to the S+ and S-did not separate during either the first block or the best block. Furthermore, whereas inactivation of cholinergic neurons impaired odor discrimination, task performance remained high in mice with inactivation of HDB GABAergic neurons. The apparent conflict between our results and those from previous studies is likely due to the different behavioral tasks used. To test the ability to discriminate odors, Nunez-Parra et al. ( 2013 ) used a habituation/dishabituation test, which is an instinctual response to odors and does not require an active learning process; we used a go/no-go test, which requires active learning to associate specific odors with the reward. Another potential alternative explanation for the discrepancy is that odor experience during associative learning leads to plastic changes that compensate for the effects caused by the GABAergic neurons. Thus, the HDB GABAergic neurons may be involved in discriminating odors instinctually but not when the discrimination requires associative learning. In summary, this study demonstrates the distinct dynamics of HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons during odor-association learning, and the different roles these two subpopulations play in odor discrimination. These findings are important for understanding the top-down regulation of sensory systems by different subpopulations of basal forebrain neurons.

Introduction Pharmacological studies in human subjects conclusively demonstrate that blockade of muscarinic cholinergic receptors by drugs such as scopolamine impairs the encoding of new memories, but not the retrieval of previously stored memories [1, 2] , and impairs working memory for some stimuli [3] . Conversely, drugs which activate nicotinic receptors enhance the encoding of new information [4, 5] . This article will discuss how the specific cellular effects of acetylcholine within cortical structures could underlie the role of acetylcholine in encoding of new memories. Anatomical location of the cholinergic effect Localized infusions of cholinergic antagonists into specific anatomical structures demonstrate the importance of cholinergic receptors for particular aspects of memory tasks. Localized infusions of scopolamine into parahippocampal structures demonstrate a role of cholinergic receptors in these structures for the encoding of information for subsequent recognition in both monkeys [6] and rats [7] . These studies used tasks in which animals are exposed to one or multiple sample stimuli during encoding, and are subsequently tested on their delayed recognition of these sample stimuli and rejection of other stimuli which were not presented during the sample phase. Local infusions into perirhinal cortex in monkeys impair encoding for subsequent recognition, whereas infusions into dentate gyrus or inferotemporal cortex do not [6] . Local infusions into perirhinal cortex in rats impair object recognition, as measured by exploration time, but do not impair spatial alternation, suggesting task specificity [7] . Local application of cholinergic antagonists into other regions also cause selective impairments. Infusions of scopolamine into the hippocampus impair spatial encoding [8] and infusions into the medial septum impair spatial learning and reduce acetylcholine release in the hippocampus [9] . Infusions of carbachol into the medial septum, which increase levels of hippocampal acetylcholine, also impair memory [9, 10] , possibly by interfering with consolidation [10] . Infusions of scopolamine into region CA3 cause selective impairments of encoding but not retrieval in the Hebb-Williams maze [11] . Anatomical localization of cholinergic function can also be studied with localized injections of saporin conjugated with antibodies to cholinergic neurons. Retrograde transport of the saporin results in a selective lesion of cholinergic neurons innervating the structure that was injected. Selective lesions of the entorhinal cortex in rats cause impairments in delayed nonmatch to sample for novel but not familiar odor stimuli [12] . Similarly, cholinergic lesions of the perirhinal cortex in monkeys cause impairments in visual delayed match to sample performance [13] . Selective cholinergic lesions of the medial septum do not cause impairments as strong as complete medial septal lesions, suggesting that the role of this cholinergic innervation in spatial memory encoding can be substituted by GABAergic innervation from the medial septum [14] . The anatomical localization studies allow behavioral effects to be linked to specific cellular effects of acetylcholine described using intracellular recording techniques in slice preparations. Computational models demonstrate how the cellular mechanisms of these effects could enhance encoding of memories. These cellular mechanisms include: 1.) enhancement of the influence of afferent input relative to excitatory feedback; 2.) regulation of inhibition and theta rhythm oscillations, 3.) enhancement of persistent spiking for active maintenance, and 4.) enhancement of synaptic modification. Enhancement of afferent input relative to excitatory feedback As summarized in Figure 1 , acetylcholine may enhance the encoding of memory by enhancing the influence of feedforward afferent input to the cortex, making cortical circuits respond to features of sensory stimuli, while decreasing excitatory feedback activity mediating retrieval. This change in dynamics results from effects including nicotinic enhancement of excitatory afferent input, and muscarinic presynaptic inhibition of excitatory feedback. Nicotinic enhancement of afferent input The behavioral evidence for nicotinic enhancement of memory function may partly result from enhancement of afferent input to cortical structures where memories are encoded. For example, nicotinic enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission has been shown for the afferent input to hippocampal region CA3 from entorhinal cortex [15] and from the dentate gyrus [16] , but not for excitatory feedback within CA3. Similarly, in thalamocortical slice preparations of somatosensory cortex [17] , activation of nicotinic receptors enhances thalamic input but not excitatory feedback synapses. Nicotinic enhancement of glutamatergic transmission has also been shown at the medial dorsal thalamic input to prefrontal cortex [18] . These effects could enhance the influence of sensory input on cortical spiking activity during encoding, particularly since they would be accompanied by enhancement of the spiking response to afferent input due to muscarinic depolarization of pyramidal cells and reductions in spike frequency accommodation [reviewed in [2, 19] ]. Muscarinic presynaptic inhibition Acetylcholine may also enhance encoding via muscarinic presynaptic inhibition of excitatory feedback synapses within cortical circuits [2] . Modeling shows that the reduction of excitatory feedback enhances encoding by reducing interference from previous retrieval [20] . In the piriform cortex, cholinergic modulation causes selective presynaptic inhibition of excitatory feedback potentials, while having a much weaker effect on afferent synaptic potentials [21] . In region CA3 of hippocampus, muscarinic receptors suppress excitatory transmission at recurrent connections in stratum radiatum [22, 23] , but not at afferent synapses in stratum lucidum [22] or stratum lacunosum moleculare (Kremin and Hasselmo, unpublished data). Acetylcholine suppresses excitatory potentials in stratum radiatum of region CA1 [20, 24] , but not as much in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM), where entorhinal cortex layer III input terminates [20] . Presynaptic inhibition appears to be stronger for synapses with AMPA receptors versus silent synapses in hippocampus [25] consistent with physiological evidence that presynaptic inhibition is stronger for recently potentiated synapses in piriform cortex [26] . Modeling demonstrates that this selectivity would enhance self-organization of new representations for afferent input [26] , which has been shown experimentally [27] . Consistent with the models of cholinergic presynaptic inhibition in hippocampus, local infusion of cholinergic antagonists in hippocampus causes an increase in background spiking activity in unit recordings [28] . Presynaptic inhibition also appears in areas such as the subiculum [29] . These effects could alter cortical functional dynamics as acetylcholine levels change during waking and sleep [30] . High cholinergic levels during waking suppress feedback, providing dominant feedforward effects appropriate for encoding, and reducing the influence of hippocampus on entorhinal cortex [31] . In contrast, lower acetylcholine levels during slow wave sleep remove the presynaptic inhibition, resulting in dominant feedback effects appropriate for consolidation, and resulting in greater spiking activity and evoked potentials in deep layers of entorhinal cortex [31] . This predicts that consolidation of memory should be impaired by increases in acetylcholine levels during consolidation. This hypothesis is supported by impairments of consolidation caused by cholinergic infusions into medial septum after training in rats [10] and effects of the acetylcholinesterase blocker physostigmine on consolidation in humans [32] . Effects in neocortical structures are consistent with this functional framework, as cholinergic modulation causes presynaptic inhibition of feedback synapses from higher order somatosensory cortex, while having less effect on synaptic potentials elicited in layer IV [33] . Similarly, acetylcholine suppresses intracortical synaptic potentials but not thalamocortical input in the auditory cortex [34] , and primary visual cortex [35] . Modulation of inhibition and theta rhythm oscillations Acetylcholine may also enhance encoding through its role in increasing theta rhythm oscillations within the hippocampal formation [36, 37] . Encoding is enhanced when stimuli are presented during periods of theta rhythmicity [38] . Modeling demonstrates how performance in memory tasks can be enhanced by changes in encoding and retrieval dynamics within each cycle of the theta rhythm [39] , as shown in Figure 2 . Theta rhythm is blocked by combined lesions of the cholinergic and GABAergic input from the medial septum [40] . Cholinergic neurons show theta rhythmic firing, which could provide rhythmic modulation of neuronal function in the hippocampus [41] . Interneurons play an important role in theta rhythm [42] . Cholinergic modulation directly depolarizes many hippocampal interneurons [43] [44] [45] , which could enhance their activity during theta rhythm. Muscarinic receptors also reduce release of GABA [46] . This effect appears paradoxical, but computational modeling demonstrates that these combined effects reduce background activity, while heightening the response to suprathreshold sensory stimuli [19] . Cholinergic modulation also increases the rhythmicity of some interneurons [43] . This cholinergic regulation of interneuron rhythmicity could contribute to regulating the encoding and retrieval dynamics of the hippocampus, as shown in Figure 2 . In the hippocampus, muscarinic receptors selectively depolarize oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, but not non-OLM cells [47] . This could provide separate rhythmic timing of dendritic and somatic inhibition which could enhance separation of encoding and retrieval dynamics during theta rhythm oscillations [39, 48] . Enhancement of persistent spiking Acetylcholine has been demonstrated to enhance the persistent spiking of individual cortical neurons, which could provide a mechanism for active maintenance of novel information. This effect has been shown in entorhinal cortex [49] , as well as other regions. As illustrated in Figure 3 , in standard control conditions, entorhinal neurons will respond to an intracellular depolarizing current injection by generating spiking activity during the current injection, but will terminate spiking after the end of current injection. In contrast, during perfusion with the cholinergic agonist carbachol, neurons respond to the same magnitude and duration of depolarizing current injection with an increased number of spikes, and when the current injection ends, they persist in spiking activity for an extended period of many seconds or even minutes [49, 50] . This effect has also been described in other areas including perirhinal cortex [Giocomo, Tahvildari and Hasselmo, unpublished data] and prefrontal cortex [51] . This persistent spiking provides an excellent mechanism for active maintenance of novel information both for short-term working memory and for encoding of information into longterm memory. Detailed computational simulations of the entorhinal cortex [52] demonstrate how the cholinergic activation of intrinsic mechanisms for persistent spiking could underlie spiking activity during the delay period of delayed matching tasks in both rats [53] and monkeys [54] , as well as phenomena such as match and non-match enhancement and suppression which occur during these tasks. Modeling demonstrates how cholinergic modulation activates a nonspecific cation current which causes a regenerative cycle in which spiking causes voltagesensitive calcium influx which further activates the non-specific cation current, causing persistent spiking. Modeling also demonstrates cellular mechanisms for the neurons in deep layers of entorhinal cortex which maintain graded firing frequencies for an extended period [50] . Modeling demonstrates how these intrinsic mechanisms for persistent firing could allow working memory for novel stimuli, for which synaptic connectivity has not previously been modified [12] . Consistent with this, scopolamine reduces parahippocampal fMRI activity observed during the delay period of a delayed match to sample task [55] . Loss of this persistent activity could underlie the impairment of delayed matching function in humans caused by scopolamine [3] , as well as the impairments of encoding observed with localized infusions of scopolamine [6] . This hypothesis is also consistent with evidence that medial temporal lesions selectively impair working memory for new conjunctions of stimuli and complex nonverbalizable visual stimuli [56] . Cholinergic enhancement of long-term potentiation Obviously, acetylcholine could also enhance encoding by enhancing long-term potentiation. Acetylcholine enhances LTP in many areas, including the hippocampus [57, 58] , entorhinal cortex [59] and piriform cortex [60] . In region CA1, induction of LTP depends on phase relative to spontaneous oscillatory activity [57] . Stimulation of the medial septum enhances LTP induction in vivo [61] and scopolamine blocks the LTP enhancement associated with medial septal activity [62] . Recent studies also demonstrate nicotinic enhancement of long-term potentiation [4] . Conclusions In summary, there is increasing convergence of research on the role of acetylcholine in learning and memory. Top-down behavioral approaches have become more focused in using anatomically localized manipulations of cholinergic modulation. Bottom up cellular data from brain slice physiology can be linked to behavior by use of detailed computational models. Future work should combine local pharmacological manipulations with physiological recording in structures such as entorhinal cortex, to test whether cholinergic antagonists block persistent spiking activity and enhance feedback effects. In addition, studies should explore the role of cholinergic modulation in regulating the timing of action potentials relative to theta rhythm oscillations. Effect of acetylcholine on cortical dynamics. Left: High acetylcholine (ACh) levels enhance the magnitude of afferent input to cortex through action at nicotinic receptors. High ACh also suppresses the magnitude of feedback excitation in cortex via presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release. Right: Low acetylcholine levels result in a weaker influence of afferent input relative to the strength of excitatory feedback. Schematic of functional dynamics during theta rhythm. Modeling [39] suggests that encoding occurs at the trough and rising slope of theta, when current sinks are strong in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM), where entorhinal input terminates, and currents in layers receiving CA3 input are weak. Retrieval would occur near the peak and falling slope of theta, when current sinks in SLM are weak and sinks in layers receiving CA3 input are strong. Selective cholinergic modulation of SLM interneurons [43] and oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells [47] could selectively regulate inhibition of entorhinal input from weak to strong during different phases of theta.

This working memory may depend on persistent spiking. Ovsepian -*Demonstration that activation of cholinergic receptors in vivo enhances the induction of long-term potentiation.

Top: In control conditions, a neuron responds to depolarizing input representing sample and test by spiking only during the depolarization. Bottom: Muscarinic cholinergic activation (High ACh) of intrinsic mechanisms allows persistent spiking to continue after the sample stimulus, resulting in spiking during the delay period for active maintenance of the stimulus, and causing greater spiking response during the matching test stimulus.

density multi-channel electro-and magneto-encephalographic recordings (EEG and MEG) have allowed for unprecedented advances in our understanding of the physiology of human selective attention. This report specifically addresses evidence for the role of oscillatory brain mechanisms in selective attention (e.g., Vanni et al., 1997; Foxe et al., 1998; Gruber et al., 1999; Shibata et al., 1999; Sokolov et al., 1999; Worden et al., 2000; Sauseng et al., 2005; Yamagishi et al., 2005; Kelly et al., 2006; Thut et al., 2006; Rihs et al., 2007; Snyder and Foxe, 2010) . Two basic varieties of attentionally mediated, selective modulation of the neural circuitry involved in processing a particular stimulus array can be envisioned. The first, and by far the most often reported, involves the selective enhancement of neural responsiveness or efficacy in those cells responsible for processing the particular stimulus upon which a subject's attention is focused, whether that stimulus is already present or merely anticipated (e.g., Moran and Desimone, 1985; Haenny and Schiller, 1988; Corbetta et al., 1993; Luck et al., 1997) . The second variety of attentional modulation involves selective inhibition or disengagement of those neurons responsible for processing stimuli outside of the focus of attention, so that competing or distracting information is not or will not be processed fully (e.g., Moran and Desimone, 1985; Motter, 1993; Foxe et al., 1998; Reynolds et al., 1999; Vanduffel et al., 2000; Worden et al., 2000) . This would involve placing the neural circuitry normally responsible for processing such distracters in some "Sit in reverie, and watch the changing color of the waves that break upon the idle seashore of the mind." -Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The ability to selectively attend to a specific subset of one's sensory realm is at the root of human cognition and negotiation of one's environment. The alternative, whereby all information in one's sensory domain is processed to the level of consciousness, does not allow for normal function and may be partially involved in certain neural disorders such as Autism spectrum disorders (cf. Markram and Markram, 2010) and attention deficit disorder (Armstrong et al., 2001) . By necessity, successful task completion in daily life employs selective attention to one extent or another. By inference, the ability to attend is assumed to be a "capacity-limited" system and to some degree, humans have executive or conscious control over what aspects of their environment are tapping this limited system from moment-to-moment (e.g., Broadbent, 1958; Kahneman, 1973; Neely, 1977; Schneider and Shiffrin, 1977; Shiffrin and Schneider, 1977; Schneider and Fisk, 1982) . This endogenous form of attention is distinct from attention that is captured by salient stimuli in the environment in an involuntary fashion (exogenous attention). How the brain achieves endogenous attentional selectivity has been a matter of vigorous research for some decades now. Advances in neuroimaging technologies such as the hemodynamic functional imaging methodologies (fMRI and PET) and the ability to conduct high-Evidence has amassed from both animal intracranial recordings and human electrophysiology that neural oscillatory mechanisms play a critical role in a number of cognitive functions such as learning, memory, feature binding and sensory gating. The wide availability of high-density electrical and magnetic recordings (64-256 channels) over the past two decades has allowed for renewed efforts in the characterization and localization of these rhythms. A variety of cognitive effects that are associated with specific brain oscillations have been reported, which range in spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics depending on the context. Our laboratory has focused on investigating the role of alpha-band oscillatory activity (8-14 Hz) as a potential attentional suppression mechanism, and this particular oscillatory attention mechanism will be the focus of the current review. We discuss findings in the context of intersensory selective attention as well as intrasensory spatial and feature-based attention in the visual, auditory, and tactile domains. The weight of evidence suggests that alpha-band oscillations can be actively invoked within cortical regions across multiple sensory systems, particularly when these regions are involved in processing irrelevant or distracting information. That is, a central role for alpha seems to be as an attentional suppression mechanism when objects or features need to be specifically ignored or selected against. mechanisms, anticipatory suppression, in a number of contexts: anticipatory suppression of one modality in favor of another (Foxe et al., 1998; Fu et al., 2001) , suppression of portions of space that are likely to contain distractor information (Worden et al., 2000; Kelly et al., 2006) , as well as suppression of visual features such as color or motion (Snyder and Foxe, 2010) . The Cuing Paradigm In order to study the preparatory mechanisms of attentional biasing, we have employed the "cuing paradigm" to invoke endogenous biasing of the attentional system. This is an effective experimental means of ensuring invocation of a high level of endogenous control by the use of symbolic cues that actively instruct the subject in an unpredictable manner to switch attention between tasks. That is, a centrally presented cue such as an arrow, word, or sound is employed (stimulus 1 -S1), which informs of an upcoming task or indicates a specific location, modality, or feature for subsequent analysis (stimulus 2 -S2). This manipulation is a nice experimental version of what is a fairly natural way of apportioning attention in our environment. That is, humans spend a large part of their existence assigning attentive resources to their environment based on both external and internal instructional sets. Such endogenous cuing paradigms can be classified into two basic categories: "probabilistic" and "instructional." In a probabilistic cuing paradigm, participants are instructed to respond to all target S2's, including those that may occur at an uncued location. Critically, the cue indicates the correct location of the target on a high proportion of trials, which encourages the participants to utilize the information provided by the cue. The uncued location in this case cannot be considered a source of distracters, however, since participants still need to respond to targets there. In contrast, an instructional cuing paradigm requires the participants to respond to targets occurring at the cued location only, and to ignore the uncued location completely. In this way, the uncued location becomes simply a source of potentially distracting information, since stimuli occurring there will never warrant a response. On the other hand, since no response is ever made to such distracters, a physiological measure is needed to evaluate the processing thereof. alPha-band effeCTs in inTersensory aTTenTion Using an instructional endogenous cueing paradigm, we originally found differential modulation of parieto-occipital alphaband (8-14 Hz) oscillatory activity in the period preceding an imperative stimulus (S2) when visually presented word-cues (S1) instructed subjects in an intersensory attention paradigm (Foxe et al., 1998 ; Figure 1 ). In that experiment, subjects were cued to attend either the visual or auditory portion of a subsequent compound audio-visual stimulus, which occurred predictably 1.1 s after the cue. We showed that the cue instruction to attend the auditory modality (the word "BEEP") resulted in significantly larger 8-14 Hz activity over parieto-occipital cortex in the anticipatory period preceding the S2 than when subjects were cued to attend the visual modality (the word "FLASH"). This effect was not due to eye closing or gaze issues as eye movements were carefully monitored and subjects were instructed to maintain fixation during both attend-auditory and attend-visual anticipatory periods. We hypothesized that this oscillatory enhancement in the case of form of inhibited or decreased receptivity state. Evidence from behavioral studies supports such a mechanism, as reaction times to stimuli presented at non-attended locations are slower relative to those at attended locations (e.g., Posner et al., 1980) , and precuing visual targets when they are presented with accompanying distracters improves performance to levels seen when no distracters were presented (Morgan et al., 1998) . Some evidence suggests that one correlate of the first variety of attention, enhancement of neural processing for stimuli at the focus of attention, is the selective modulation of evoked gamma-band oscillatory activity (e.g., Gruber et al., 1999; Shibata et al., 1999; Sokolov et al., 1999; Fries et al., 2001) . The evoked gamma-band response has been implicated as a neural mechanism for feature binding (e.g., Singer, 1993 Singer, , 1999)) , and these studies have suggested that this binding function can be selectively invoked during attention tasks. Attention effects in the gamma-band have typically been observed subsequent to stimulus onset. A key aspect of endogenous attention, however, is the ability to prepare attentional resources in preparation for an expected stimulus prior to its onset. One mechanism that has been suggested for the complementary, suppressive form of attention in the visual domain is the selective invocation of cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic oscillations (Lopes da Silva, 1991) . Since alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz) are known to be related to general alerting and ongoing visual processing (Adrian and Matthews, 1934; Klimesch et al., 1998) and are seen in the EEG, even when subjects are involved in highly demanding tasks, we proposed that such oscillations may also be involved in selective attention mechanisms (Foxe et al., 1998) . In support, the amplitudes of both the auditory and visual N1-P2 ERP components are modulated based on stimulus-preceding alpha amplitude (e.g., Brandt and Jansen, 1991; Brandt et al., 1991; Rahn and Bas¸ar, 1993a,b; Brandt, 1997) with the caveat that in these studies, the reported effects could be mainly due to arousal issues. More compellingly, Vanni et al. (1997) demonstrated a parieto-occipital alpha effect such that alpha level became higher in the period following presentation of a "non-object" stimulus as opposed to meaningful objects. They suggested that this represented a disengagement of attention by parietal attention gating structures in the inferior parietal region. We predicted that such attentional disengagement might also be a facet of anticipatory attentional biasing mechanisms. Our results regarding this prediction from a series of studies are discussed below. alPha and anTiCiPaTory gaTing of aTTenTion anTiCiPaTory biasing In our laboratory, we have been particularly interested in detailing the top-down mechanisms by which the brain establishes biased attentional states -that is, anticipatory sets. Until the past decade or so the vast majority of attention research had concentrated on the effects of attention on the processing of attended versus unattended stimuli that occurs subsequently, as a result of attentional biasing (see Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Hillyard and Anllo-Vento, 1998) . When the brain is involved in attentionally demanding tasks, it is advantageous to direct attention to the relevant stimulus, location, or action that is to be engaged in, prior to the arrival of the stimulus or execution of the action. We have reported a neural correlate of the second form of biasing (1997) . In such models, the posterior parietal areas of the fast dorsal visual stream mediate the extent of processing of a particular stimulus through parietal inputs to the thalamic relay nuclei, nucleus reticularis, and the putamen, and also through modulatory inputs to the ventral visual stream, which is specialized for the high level extraction of featural information from stimuli. That is, the spatially specialized dorsal stream areas control the gateways to ventral visual processing. How exactly this is achieved is currently a matter of debate. We suggested that the enhanced parieto-occipital alphaband activity seen in our intersensory selective attention paradigm the attend-auditory instruction might reflect anticipatory gating of visual processing by parieto-occipital structures, which are known to be involved in attentional switching and disengagement within the visual modality (e.g., Posner et al., 1984; Farah et al., 1989; Posner and Petersen, 1990) . alPha-band effeCTs in Visual sPaTial aTTenTion We interpreted the results of Foxe et al. (1998) in terms of visual spatial attention theories that posit parietal control of visual selective attention such as those of Van der Heijden (1991) , LaBerge The cue indicated whether audition (BEEP) or vision (FLASH) was relevant for the trial. After a 1085-ms cue-target interval of no stimulation, the participants were presented with a pair of red disks on the screen and a concurrent pair of tones via headphones. For the visual target, one of the red disks was displaced slightly with respect to the reflection of the other disk across the vertical meridian (on standard trials, the two disks were symmetric about the vertical meridian). For the auditory target, the two tones had slightly different pitches (the two tones had the same pitch on standard trials). Participants were instructed to press a button upon detection of a target in the cued sensory modality should be selectively deployed to regions of space that need to be ignored. That is, alpha-gating should occur in cortices that are likely to receive distracter information. We then examined this prediction in a visuo-spatial cueing study (Worden et al., 2000 ; Figure 2 ). represented a selective inhibition of "all" of visual space and was one mechanism by which visual space could be selectively inhibited. The prediction from these results would be that during visual spatial selective attention paradigms, such alpha-gating mechanisms Visual feaTure-based aTTenTion We also asked if this gating function of alpha-band activity was specific to spatial and intersensory attention, or rather if alpha could play a role in the biasing of attention between other stimulus parameters within a given modality, such as visual features (Snyder and Foxe, 2010 ; Figure 3 ). It was well established from prior research that attention can be deployed to non-spatial visual features, such as color or motion parameters, facilitating the processing of subsequent stimuli incorporating the attended feature, independently of spatial location (e.g., Corbetta et al., 1991; Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004; Wylie et al., 2004 Wylie et al., , 2006;; Most and Astur, 2007; Egner et al., 2008) . We again utilized an instructional cuing paradigm, although in this case the cues directed participants to attend to either the color or motion of an upcoming stimulus consisting of many small moving and colored dots. Participants were tasked with making a difficult discrimination with respect to the cued feature. We chose the features of color and motion because they have well-described, spatially separated cortical processing centers in the dorsal and ventral visual streams, respectively (Ungerleider and Mishkin, 1982) . Using independent components analysis (ICA), we were able to isolate cortical sources that were highly dynamic in the alpha band during the preparatory cue-S2 interval, and some of these sources differentiated between attention to color and attention to motion. Such sources located in putative dorsal stream regions showed increased power in the alpha band when motion was irrelevant, whereas sources located in ventral regions showed increased alpha power when color was irrelevant. This pattern of results is analogous to the suppression effect observed with spatial attention, in which cortical areas responsible for processing irrelevant or distracting information show anticipatory increases in alpha band power. audiTory and somaTosensory sPaTial aTTenTion Alpha-mediated suppression has thus been shown to be robustly involved in anticipatory attention in the visual domain. It is natural to ask if alpha-band activity also plays a role in the anticipatory suppression of information in other sensory domains. Several studies have investigated this possibility. A role for alpha-mediated biasing of spatial attention has been reported when attention is directed to S2's presented in the auditory domain (Kerlin et al., 2010; Banerjee et al., in press ). Kerlin et al. (2010) directed participants to selectively attend to one of two competing speech streams in an auditory spatial attention task while the researchers recorded EEG. They found alpha-band increases over parietal cortex ipsilateral to the cued direction, consistent with the findings of Worden et al. (2000) . It should be mentioned, however, that the researchers examined only the interval during which the stimulus was actually presented, rather than the preparatory interval. Additionally, a visual arrow cue was used, which has been shown to have strong exogenous effects on the allocation of visual attention (e.g., Ivanoff and Saoud, 2009) , admitting a potentially confounding factor. In Banerjee et al. (in press) , we used centrally presented symbolic auditory cues to direct attention to auditory S2's appearing to the left and right of the participant. Participants' only visual concern was to maintain fixation on a small dot on a computer screen. No visual information was available concerning the In this visuo-spatial experiment, centrally presented arrow cues were used to direct attention to the left or right visual fields and alternately to the upper and lower quadrants within the visual hemifields. Subjects were required to make orientation and motiondirection judgments upon the subsequent S2 stimuli. It should be emphasized that only stimuli occurring at the cued location were relevant to the task, such that stimuli occurring opposite to the cued location could be deemed distracters. Compellingly, we found that deployment of visual attention to one hemifield resulted in anticipatory sustained focal increases in alpha-band activity over occipital cortex ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention. Further, these foci also moved retinotopically depending on whether attention was deployed to the upper or lower quadrants. Thus, in a spatial selective attention condition, enhanced alpha-band activity was seen over the retinotopic area that was likely to contain distracter stimuli, consistent with a role for these oscillatory processes in inhibition of non-cued spatial locations and consistent with the predictions of Foxe et al. (1998) . This basic finding of retinotopically specific alpha-band mediated suppression of potentially distracting locations has subsequently been replicated and expanded several times (Sauseng et al., 2005; Yamagishi et al., 2005; Kelly et al., 2006; Thut et al., 2006; Rihs et al., 2009; Cosmelli et al., 2011) . Cross-sensory Cuing of aTTenTion In Foxe et al. (1998) , we used visually presented word-cues to direct the deployment of attention to either the visual (FLASH) or auditory (BEEP) modalities. A central question in intersensory attention and more particularly in multisensory integration is the extent to which there are cross-sensory links in attention mechanisms. A number of papers have addressed this issue (Perrott et al., 1990 (Perrott et al., , 1996;; Spence and Driver, 1996, 1997a,b; Eimer and Schröger, 1998; Dufour, 1999; Eimer, 1999) . One question is whether cues presented in a modality other than vision could invoke the alpha-gating mechanism reported by Foxe et al. (1998) and Worden et al. (2000) . We investigated crosssensory cuing effects upon the alpha-gating effect (Fu et al., 2001 ) by using auditory cues to inform subjects in an intersensory attention experiment similar to the one used in Foxe et al. (1998) . We found that the use of auditory cues can indeed invoke the alpha-gating mechanism. In this experiment, subjects received an auditory cue (1 click = attend-auditory; 2 clicks = attend-visual) which was followed 1.2 s later by a compound auditory/visual imperative stimulus. As with our previous study, subjects were required to perform a difficult sensory discrimination task within the cued modality and to ignore the uncued/distracter modality, while maintaining fixation nonetheless. We inspected the alpha-band activity in the period following the cue-stimulus but preceding arrival of the tobe-attended imperative stimulus. The fundamental finding of Foxe et al. (1998) -increases in parieto-occipital alpha power in preparation for the auditory task -was replicated. This result indicates that alpha-mediated visual gating can be cross-sensorily cued. Similarly, Jones et al. (2010) used a visual cue to direct spatial attention in anticipation of a tactile S2 and observed spatially specific shifts in alpha band power over somatosensory cortices. Successful crosssensory cuing of alpha-mediated gating mechanisms is significant because it underscores the endogenous origin of the effects. That is, mere low-level processing of the sensory aspects of the cue cannot account for the attentional effects. Can alPha be Considered an aCTiVe meChanism for aTTenTional suPPression? One alternative interpretation of alpha-band modulations in selective attention paradigms could be that alpha-band power is not increased in areas processing distracter information, but rather that such "increases" in fact reflect a return to baseline levels for areas processing distracters, whereas maintenance of relative desynchronization in the alpha band in areas processing potential target information reflects preparatory enhancement and leads to the observed topographical asymmetries. This argument has its historical roots in the notion that alpha activity represents a cortical "idling" state, whereas the relative absence of alpha reflects cortical activity (e.g., Pfurtscheller, 1992) , and is of particular relevance when visual cues are used, as visual stimulus onset itself leads to substantial decreases in the amplitude of ongoing alpha oscillations (e.g., Mulholland, 1965; Pfurtscheller and Aranibar, 1977) , complicating the picture of spectro-temporal dynamics. We investigated this possibility in an experiment that used rapid serial visual presentation to maintain a consistent level of stimulusrelated desynchronization in the alpha band (Kelly et al., 2006 ; Figure 4 ). In this experiment, participants were presented with potential location of the S2's, which were obscured behind curtains in the dimly lit recording chamber. It was observed that parietooccipital alpha power increased ipsilateral to the cued direction during the cue-target interval. This suggests that alpha-mediated biasing operates within sensory modalities other than vision, since the participants in this case never had a need to bias visual processing to perform the task. Similar biasing effects in the alpha band have been observed for spatial attention in anticipation of a tactile event (e.g., Jones et al., 2010; Van Ede et al., 2011) . In these tactile attention experiments, alpha band increases are typically observed over somatosensory cortex ipsilateral to the cued direction, suggesting some degree of sensory specificity to the mechanism. Such diverse observations of alpha-mediated suppression suggest that it might be a general mechanism for the suppression of parts of sensory space. Alpha-mediated attentional gating has thus been robustly observed across a variety of attention tasks, in multiple sensory modalities and with respect to several different stimulus parameters. This prevalence of alpha-mediated gating suggests that it may be a general mechanism for attentional gating of cortical processing. Following a 1.7 to 2.3-s cue-target interval, a random dot stimulus (S2) was presented for 200 ms. Dots comprising the S2 were all colored and moving. For color targets, two different colors of dots were present in the stimulus (on standard trials, all dots were uniformly colored). For motion trials, some dots moved in a different direction from the rest (on standard trials, all dots moved in the same direction). Participants were instructed to respond with a button press if they detected a target in the cued feature, and to withhold response otherwise. (B) Examples of "feature-sensitive, alpha-reactive" components for two representative subjects. Scalp-recorded data were first separated into independent components using ICA. TSE waveforms were derived for each component by Hilbert-transforming band-pass filtered (8-15 Hz) single-trials and averaging the instantaneous amplitudes across trials. For each participant, a few components were highly dynamic in the alpha range during the preparatory period ("alpha-reactive" components), and some of these alpha-reactive components moreover showed power differences based on which feature was cued ("feature-sensitive"). TSE waveforms illustrating this effect are depicted in violet for two representative subjects. The solid lines represent attention to motion and the dashed/dotted lines represent attention to color. Below the TSE waveforms, running p-values for the alpha power difference between the two attention conditions is plotted in orange. To the right of the TSE waveforms, point-equivalent dipole source estimates for the corresponding components are depicted in a standard MNI brain volume. (C) Localization of all feature-sensitive alpha-reactive components across participants. Components are color-coded according to the direction of feature-sensitivity: components with greater alpha power for attention to color than for attention to motion are plotted in red, and components with greater alpha power for attention to motion than for attention to color are plotted in blue. The distributions of the estimated sources for two types of components are significantly different. Components with higher alpha power for attention to color are generally localized to putative dorsal visual stream regions, whereas components with higher alpha power for attention to motion are generally localized to putative ventral visual stream regions. This pattern of results is consistent with a suppressive role of anticipatory alpha-band power increases. cues were used and so stimulus-related alpha desynchronization was not observed, we also found that anticipatory alpha was statistically greater than pre-cue baseline levels. Alpha-band measures of selective attention have also now been shown to predict task performance. For example, detection (Mathewson et al., 2009) and discrimination (Hanslmayr, et al., 2007; Van Dijk et al., 2008) of centrally presented near-threshold visual stimuli have been shown to be inversely related to the amplitude of alpha preceding stimulus onset. In other words, processing is less effective when alpha amplitude is greater. Mathewson et al. (2009) moreover reported that phase of ongoing alpha predicted detection ability, a very interesting finding in need of further investigation in our view. a stream of letter stimuli to both visual hemifields. Presentation rates varied from 9.45 to 17.01 Hz, and each stimulus had an 11-ms duration. A centrally presented arrow cue instructed participants to attend to one of the two streams, and the participants were instructed to count the occurrences of a target letter in the attended stream. The key result was that, following the cue, alpha power ipsilateral to the cued direction increased above pre-cue baseline levels, and no decreases in alpha power contralateral to the cued direction were observed. Because bilateral stimulation continued throughout each trial, we concluded that such increases in alpha power reflect active suppression of the to-be-ignored stimulus stream, rather than a mere return to baseline "idling." It should also be noted that in our earlier study (Fu et al., 2001) where auditory In the most direct test of the potentially causal role of alpha band activity in attentional suppression, Romei et al. (2010) again used TMS, although in this case they sought to externally drive rhythmic neural activity and observe the effects that such externally driven oscillations would have on perception. Rhythmic TMS pulses were applied either within the alpha range (10 Hz), or at a frequency above (20 Hz), or below (5 Hz) this range. The participants were asked to report when they perceived a near-threshold visual stimulus that was presented occasionally following the TMS stimulation. TMS was applied to occipital and parietal regions, and to left and right hemispheres. Additionally, so-called "sham" TMS conditions were included, which mimic the sound of true TMS without the stimulatory effects. The researchers found that TMS at 10 Hz impaired visual detection contralateral to the site of stimulation for both occipital and parietal stimulation sites, consistent with a spatially specific suppressive role of alpha-band activity with a cortical origin. Furthermore, visual detection was improved ipsilateral to the site of 10 Hz stimulation, suggesting a freeing of cognitive resources à la biased competition models. These effects had a short duration; subsiding within 3 s of TMS. Critically, no effects on visual detection were seen for stimulation at either 5 or 20 Hz. The situation may be more complex than simple gating of lowlevel stimulus processing, however. Another study by our group (O'Connell et al., 2009) used a visual sustained attention task to examine the EEG correlates of attentional lapses, as indexed by performance errors. The imperative stimulus in this experiment constantly flickered at 25 Hz, leading to a steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP) that served as the measure of low-level visual processing. We found that power in the alpha band was much higher preceding errors, and that such alpha increases could predict errors up to 20 s before they occurred. However, no differences in SSVEP amplitude were observed between periods preceding erroneous performance and those preceding correct performance. Thus, while we concluded that alpha-band power was a reliable index of attentional lapses, the results also suggested that its effect was not to diminish the efficacy of basic visual processing. neural basis of The alPha rhyThm Given the compelling accumulation of evidence across multiple laboratories pointing to an active role for alpha-band oscillations in selective attentional suppression, it is of extreme interest to examine the putative underlying neural mechanisms that give rise to this brain rhythm. The earliest description of the alpha brain rhythm is generally credited to Hans Berger from his groundbreaking 1929 paper, "On the electroencephalogram in man": The electroencephalogram represents a continuous curve with continuous oscillations in which… one can distinguish larger first order waves with an average duration of 90 milliseconds [Alpha waves] and smaller second order waves of an average duration of 35 milliseconds [Beta waves]. (Berger, 1929) Despite the fact that alpha was one of the first signatures of the EEG noted and is perhaps the best known brain rhythm outside of the neurosciences, and given that no specialized training whatsoever would be necessary to pick out this most prominent of brain rhythms from an ongoing EEG signal, it is perhaps rather surprising One study from our group examined the relationship between inter-individual differences in resting alpha band power and performance on a sustained attention to response task (SART; Dockree et al., 2007) . In this paradigm, participants viewed the digits "1" through "9" presented sequentially on a computer screen. The participants were instructed to press a button to the onset of each digit, except for digit "3," to which response was to be withheld. Prior work had established a component of the ERP in response to the preceding digit (i.e., "2") that predicted whether participants would commit an error of commission when the digit "3" was presented. This so-called "late positive 1" (LP1) component was lower-amplitude before errors of commission than before correctly withheld responses. For this study, we compared the tonic levels of alpha in each participant to the amplitude of that participant's LP1 component and task performance. It was found that participants with greater tonic alpha levels had larger LP1 components, and that this relationship predicted performance on the sustained attention task. With respect to spatial selective attention, the strength of attentional biasing as reflected by the degree of asymmetry of alpha power over visual areas has been shown to be an effective predictor of task performance (Thut et al., 2006; Kelly, et al., 2009) . Furthermore, the degree of such alpha asymmetry has been shown to scale with the probability of a valid cue in a probabilistically cued visual spatial attention paradigm (Gould et al., 2011) , suggesting implicit optimization of the mechanism. does alPha shaPe PerCePTion? Toward sTudying iTs Causal role A series of powerful experiments by Romei et al. (2008a Romei et al. ( ,b, 2010) ) used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to demonstrate strong associations between ongoing alpha-band power over visual cortex and perceptual experience. In the first such study (Romei et al., 2008a) , the researchers applied magnetic pulses to visual cortex of human participants, which resulted in some of the participants experiencing visual percepts (phosphenes). For each participant, the researchers determined the minimum strength of the magnetic pulse required to elicit phosphenes (the "phosphene threshold"). Additionally, the researchers recorded resting EEG from each participant. They found that phosphene threshold was positively correlated with resting power in the alpha band across individuals. That is, more intense stimulation was required to evoke visual percepts in individuals with greater alpha levels, consistent with a role for alpha activity as an active gating mechanism. Those individuals with the very greatest levels of resting alpha did not perceive phosphenes with even the highest-intensity TMS tested. It is worth noting that no relationship was found between phosphene threshold and activity in other canonical frequency bands tested (i.e., delta, theta, beta, or gamma). A follow-up study using concurrent TMS and EEG revealed that spontaneous fluctuations of alpha-band power reflect the excitability of cortex on a single-trial basis within single subjects and in a spatially specific manner (Romei et al., 2008b) , providing another compelling demonstration of the intimate links between moment-to-moment alpha-band fluctuations within visual cortex and the ongoing susceptibility of those regions to be activated. It should be mentioned, however, that a failure to observe effects of attention in the initial sensory response to the S2 might reflect type II error. The ability to detect effects at the scalp using EEG is intimately tied to the position and orientation of the cortical areas involved. When such areas are small and discrete, as in early stages of sensory processing, the likelihood of stimulating an appropriately oriented patch of cortex is relatively small when compared to the larger areas of coordinated activity characteristic of higher-order processes. In one experiment (Kelly et al., 2008) , we presented visual stimuli systematically across different locations in the visual field for each participant and determined which stimulus position resulted in the largest C1 component (the first cortically evoked component of the visual-evoked potential, which reflects early V1 activation) separately for each individual. This "ideal" stimulus location was then used for a spatial selective attention task, highly similar to that used by Worden et al. (2000) . Thus, each participant received a "customized" stimulus set designed to maximize the ability to detect effects in the initial afferent activity in V1. Using this design, which takes into account individual anatomical differences, we were able to detect modulation of the initial C1 component by spatial attention, consistent with modulation of the initial afferent volley in V1. Thus, absence of an observed effect during the initial sensory response cannot rule out a gating effect at the level of the thalamus. It has been shown, but again in anesthetized animals, that the receptive field properties of V1 vary significantly in conjunction with changes in the level of synchronous activity in the corticothalamic visual system (Wörgötter et al., 1998 ; see also Li et al., 1999) . These authors proposed that the high level of inhibition of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells by cells of the PGN that occurs during synchronous EEG states leads to bursting activity in LGN which results in larger and less specific V1 receptive fields. Alternately, when inhibition is relieved during asynchronous EEG activity, the LGN neurons are placed in a "tonic transmission mode" which sharpens the receptive fields. The authors go on to suggest behavioral significance for this process in that the animal's behavioral state could result in an adaptation of the spatial resolution of primary sensory transmission by means of such oscillatory mechanisms. This speculation is in keeping with the models proposed by Foxe et al. (1998) and Worden et al. (2000) with the renewed caveat that the alpha modulations that we have reported and the oscillations that Wörgötter records in a sleeping animal may not rely on the same inhibitory mechanisms. Another possibility raised by this finding is that the alpha effects reported in the Foxe and Worden studies did indeed have an effect at the level of the thalamus, causing a change in the receptive field characteristics in a similar fashion to those reported by Wörgötter. This might explain why it is notoriously difficult to establish effects upon the initial processing of the S2's in such designs using ERPs, since it would be unlikely that surface ERPs would be sensitive to changes in the size of receptive fields. Capotosto et al. (2009) used concurrent EEG and TMS to demonstrate the involvement of frontal eye field (FEF) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) structures in the attentional effects of alpha-band activity. Human participants performed a demanding visuo-spatial cued attention task similar to that of Worden et al. (2000) , with how incomplete our knowledge of the neural basis of the alpha remains. In what follows, we will attempt to synthesize some of the basic knowledge that does exist across species and methodologies, with the caveat that this will be a necessarily incomplete survey. CorTiCo-CorTiCal ConTribuTions Thalamo-CorTiCal ConTribuTions A key combined PET and EEG study in humans showed an inverse correlation between thalamic metabolism and alpha power in the EEG during a relaxed state (Lindgren et al., 1999) . That is, increased thalamic activity was correlated with less alpha EEG power while less thalamic metabolic activity was correlated with higher alpha power, supporting the notion that at least the non-specific alpha seen in the ongoing EEG of humans has a thalamic component. These findings are consistent with attention models such as those of LaBerge (1997) in that activity in the relay nuclei of thalamus might be suppressed by increased alpha oscillatory power in parietal cortex. Nevertheless, there may also be an important distinction between the alpha that is seen in the generally unaroused or eyesclosed state, as in the Lindgren study, and the alpha seen when subjects are involved in selective attention tasks such as those reviewed above, for which arousal is specifically controlled (see below for further discussion of variants of alpha waves). Additional evidence for a thalamic contribution to alpha-band oscillations comes from investigations of ∼10 Hz sleep-spindles. As Steriade et al. (1990) point out; there has been an "unwritten consensus that alpha waves are congeners or embryos of spindle waves," although this assumption has been becoming increasingly doubtful, as will be discussed below. Contreras et al. (1996) have shown that spindle oscillations are largely under the control of cortico-thalamic feedback. That is, by removing one cortical hemisphere in anesthetized cats, they showed that spindle sequences in thalamus did not retain their normal synchrony but became desynchronous. In addition, disrupting intracortical connectivity by making deep coronal cuts through the suprasylvian gyrus did not affect the synchronization of unaffected cortex. Destexhe et al. (1998) proposed a model based on these results and the extensive experimental findings at the Steriade laboratory whereby cortico-thalamic projections operate on the thalamus through excitatory inputs to GABAergic neurons in the nucleus reticularis, recruiting relay cells through a process of inhibition and rebound (Steriade et al., 1985; Destexhe et al., 1998) . Importantly, reticular neurons of the visual perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) are known to inhibit thalamic relay neurons (Ahlsén et al., 1985) . Their model predicts the occurrence of the experimentally observed oscillatory activity and also predicts a relative refractoriness for the network involved in such oscillations. This would appear to be consistent with the prediction of an inhibitory role for similar oscillations in our attention paradigms. However, if the alpha mechanisms that we reported in Foxe et al. (1998) were having their effect at the level of the thalamus, one would expect that such effects would be evident in the initial sensory response to the S2 stimulus. This was not the case though, suggesting that at least in that paradigm, putative oscillatory-inhibitory mechanisms may have been operating at the cortico-cortical level. The level of the hierarchy at which putative alpha inhibitory mechanisms will have their effect is likely to be task specific. This contention is supported by our findings of retinotopically specific alpha modulations in a visuo-spatial paradigm (Worden et al., 2000) . that this could suggest a differential role of alpha in high-versus low-order processing areas. One thing that seems clear is that alpha activity is far from a unitary phenomenon, and discussions of alpha must take into account the anatomical and behavioral context. VarianTs of alPha waVes As alluded to above, much of what we suppose to know about the cellular physiology and indeed the visual areas that might underlie the alpha rhythm comes from investigations conducted in sleeping and often anesthetized animals on the alpha-like ∼10 Hz sleepspindle (e.g., Jahnsen and Llinás, 1984; Steriade and Deschênes, 1984) . The extent to which sleep-spindles in an animal are generated by the same processes that generate the alpha rhythm in an awake human is really a matter of speculation but many authors have been willing to accept correspondence (e.g., Williamson et al., 1997) . Steriade et al. (1990) go on to point out that although the frequencies are essentially the same, the timecourse of the wave groupings are quite distinct with alpha manifesting in long trains, in contrast to the short bursts that constitute the sleep-spindle. Further, the topographies of each differ extensively. Nonetheless, since some correspondence has been assumed, we will describe below some of the currently available knowledge regarding the neural mechanisms of the sleep-spindle. However, in the absence of any direct evidence for a correspondence between the mechanisms of sleep-spindles ∼10 Hz oscillations and waking human alpha, we believe that we must treat of these putative correspondences with the appropriate level of caution until such time as direct evidence is available. The sleep-spindles themselves have been extensively studied and well characterized. For example, it has been shown that spindle oscillations are strongly controlled by intracortical inhibitory mechanisms and that shifts in this cortical inhibition can shift the oscillations to spike-wave desynchronous patterns (Contreras et al., 1997) . These results were derived from computational modeling procedures, as the alternative of applying anti-inhibitory agents (GABA A -antagonists) to cortex results in epileptiform discharges. The authors stress the large-scale recruitment of inhibitory neurons in cortex by the ascending thalamo-cortical fibers. Thus the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons is dominated by inhibitory inputs and leads to a low-level of pyramidal cell discharge during the oscillatory mode, a putative gating mechanism. Spindle oscillations have also been shown to be governed by inhibitory inputs from nucleus reticularis (Steriade et al., 1985; Destexhe et al., 1998) . Separating thalamic relay nuclei from their reticular inputs caused a loss of the spindle oscillations in these nuclei (Steriade et al., 1985) . In contrast, the separated reticular nucleus maintains its rhythmic activity and is implicated as a pacemaker for oscillatory activity in the thalamic relay nuclei. Some evidence specific to alpha rhythms in awake animals does exist, the earliest of which was seen in the dog. Evidence that cortico-cortical alpha oscillatory activity is at least partially independent of the thalamo-cortical alpha process was shown (Lopes da Silva et al., 1980; Lopes da Silva, 1991) . The statistical technique of partialization was used to estimate the portion of measured intracortical coherence that could be predicted by concurrent thalamo-cortical coherence. Measuring alpha from one thalamic and two cortical sites in a dog, these authors first the notable difference that participants were required to respond to all targets, including the relatively infrequent cases when targets were presented opposite to the cued location (i.e., invalidly cued). That is, all S2's were potentially relevant, and there were no distracters in the paradigm. At the onset of the cue for each trial the researchers applied TMS in one of four ways: (1) to the right IPS, (2) to the right FEF, (3) to the right Pre-central gyrus, and (4) sham TMS near the scalp vertex. It should be emphasized that the researchers did not stimulate visual cortex directly, but rather targeted association areas implicated in theoretical attention networks (e.g., LaBerge 1997; Foxe et al., 2003) . Following sham TMS, a bilateral decrease in alpha power over posterior scalp was typically observed. This decrease was greater contralateral to the cued direction. Anticipatory increases ipsilateral to the cue direction were not observed as in Worden et al. (2000) , which is likely due to the potential relevance of both hemifields and lack of potential distracters as described above. That is, no region of visual space would be deserving of attentional suppression in this context. When TMS was applied to IPS or FEF (but not pre-central gyrus) such anticipatory decreases in alpha activity were reduced. In the case of IPS stimulation, in fact, anticipatory increases were seen. Critically, the researchers found that the degree of disruption by TMS of the typical anticipatory alpha decreases was related to the participants' speed of responding to targets. These results strongly implicate the involvement of a fronto-parietal attention control network in the deployment of alpha-mediated gating mechanisms in visual cortex. Bollimunta et al. (2008) examined the laminar profiles of alpha activity in cortex of alert monkeys performing an auditory discrimination task. By using a linear array of 14 electrodes, the researchers were able to record differential voltages across the approximately 2 mm laminar structure of the cortical mantle. These voltages could then be used to infer the locations of current sources and sinks within a cortical column. Such recordings were made from areas V2, V4, and IT. Supported by Granger causality analysis, the researchers concluded that in areas V2 and V4, infragranular layers serve as the local pacemakers for the alpha rhythm, with a small mediating influence from the granular layer. This laminar pattern suggests a primary influence of cortico-cortical feedback projections in the initiation of the rhythm with a modulatory input from thalamus, as descending cortico-cortical pathways typically terminate in extragranular layers (cf. Felleman and Van Essen, 1991) , whereas thalamic projections to posterior cortex typically terminate in the granular layer (e.g., Jacobson and Trojanowski, 1975; Spatz, 1979) . In contrast, alpha generation in area IT seemed confined to extragranular layers, with supergranular layers serving as the local pacemaker -a pattern that again implicates a primarily corticocortical influence. Bollimunta et al. (2008) also examined the relationship between the amplitude of the alpha-band activity under investigation in each of the observed areas and the animals' performance on the auditory task. Areas V2 and V4 showed strong negative correlations between alpha-band power and task performance, consistent with the hypothesis that alpha reflects suppression of competing visual information in these areas and consistent with the findings of the intersensory attention studies of Foxe et al. (1998) and Fu et al. (2001) . Interestingly, area IT revealed a strong positive correlation between alpha power and task performance. The authors discussed the neural mechanisms of the attention sensitive alpha, it will fall largely to intracranial investigations in the awake behaving monkey to further resolve this puzzle. ConClusion We have described evidence for alpha-band oscillations as a mechanism for attentionally mediated selective suppression of distracting information. Alpha-band power has been shown to increase over cortical areas responsible for processing potentially distracting information. These attention-related sustained focal increases in alpha power occur prior to the arrival of an anticipated stimulus. Such alpha-band effects have been observed across a variety of selective attention tasks, including intersensory attention, spatial attention in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory domains, and visual feature-based attention. Beyond their robust occurrence during attention tasks, the state of alpha-band brain activity has been shown to predict visual cortical excitability and perceptual outcome. Specifically, higher alpha power indicates lower cortical excitability and higher perceptual thresholds. This is true for both naturally occurring and experimentally induced alpha-band activity in visual cortex. We have also discussed the anatomical basis for alpha oscillations. The strongest evidence from human TMS studies and monkey intracranial recordings indicates that attention-related alpha modulations are predominately under the control of a cortico-cortical network involving frontal and parietal regions, with a possible secondary influence from thalamo-cortical connections. This is in contrast to arousal-related alpha, which is more likely thalamusdominated, and is potentially a functionally distinct mechanism from the alpha-band modulations observed in selective attention. computed a cross power spectra between the thalamic recording and each of the two cortical recordings. Linear least-square predictions allowed them to derive a partial coherence measure by eliminating the part of the two cortical signals that could be predicted by the thalamic signal. Unfortunately, the use of a linear model does not in itself determine that cortico-cortical alpha can exist in isolation or that there is, as these authors claim, an independent component as it assumes that there is a linear relationship between the thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical components of alpha. This may not be a reasonable assumption. Nonetheless, it does at least show that the cortico-cortical part of the alpha process has added non-linear dynamics. Of importance was an added finding that pulvinar was a much larger contributor to the cortical alpha coherence than was LGN, since pulvinar has been theorized to play an important role in selective attention (e.g., Petersen et al., 1987; Robinson, 1993) . It seems plausible that while "arousal" alpha might have a large thalamic component, the alpha that is specifically modulated during selective attention tasks might rely more heavily on the corticocortical component of this system. Closing the eyes disengages the visual system in the obvious way, and when straining to hear a faint sound we often close our eyes in order to concentrate effort on the task. However, the alpha modulations reported by Foxe et al. (1998) and Worden et al. (2000) , and by many others since, were recorded during very difficult attentional tasks in which subjects were in a highly aroused state with their eyes open. How the general alpha rhythm, known to all electrophysiologists and normally associated with arousal state of the subject and these very specific modulations of 8-14 Hz oscillatory activity recorded during selective attention paradigms are related will take more studies to elucidate.

INTRODUCTION Attention is an important factor in sensory processing. Directing attention to a particular location in the visual field improves detection and discrimination, and shortens reaction times in that location relative to others (see Pashler 1998) . When behavioural performance is near threshold, attention can reliably make the difference between success and failure. Attention also affects the responses of sensory neurons. Neurons typically respond more strongly when the stimulus that drives them is the focus of attention (see Braun et al. 2001) . Behavioural performance depends on the activity of sensory neurons. Little is known, however, about how the behavioural effects of attention are related to the changes that it produces in sensory representations. This question can be approached experimentally because there appears to be a close relationship between behavioural performance on a particular task and the activity of individual sensory neurons. When the sensitivity of individual neurons is compared with the behavioural capabilities of the organism, the ability of a neuron to report about a stimulus can be about as good as that of the observer, provided the task involves stimuli that are closely matched to the preferences of the neuron in question (reviewed by Parker & Newsome 1998) . This close correspondence between neuronal and behavioural performance indicates that behavioural performance depends on, and closely follows, the selectivity of sensory neurons (Barlow 1985) . Given this correspondence between neuronal and behavioural performance, and the observation that attention changes the responses of sensory neurons, it is natural to ask whether effects of attention on behavioural perform-ance might be fully explained by changes that attention causes in the responses of sensory neurons. To address this issue, it is necessary to consider the magnitude and quality of effects that attention has on neuronal responses. In the sections that follow, we consider attentional effects on neuronal responses in the context of visual cortex, for which the most detailed and extensive data are available. We then describe recent experiments from our laboratory that directly examine how attention can affect the relationship between neuronal and behavioural performance. THE MAGNITUDE OF MODULATION OF NEURONAL RESPONSES BY ATTENTION Spatial attention has been found to affect neuronal responses in every visual cortical area examined. Most neurons respond more strongly when the subject attends to a stimulus within their receptive field, compared with attention to another stimulus far from the receptive field. However, the amount by which attention alters neuronal responses can vary greatly between different visual areas, and between neurons within a given visual area. Task demands can also affect the amount by which attention alters responses. Within any visual area, neurons differ in the degree to which they are influenced by spatial attention. Figure 1 shows a representative distribution of attentional modulations, based on a sample of neurons from area V4 in monkey visual cortex. The average modulation was a 26% increase in response when attention was directed to the receptive field stimulus, but the responses of some neurons were twofold or threefold stronger. The responses of other neurons were not obviously affected by attention, and still others responded more strongly when attention was directed away from the receptive field. A broad range of effects that includes both positive and negative modulations is typical for studies of attention in visual cortex. Why different neurons show different degrees of attentional modulation is not understood, nor has the degree 60 0 0.3 1 3 number of neurons modulation by attention (attended/unattended) Figure 1 . Typical distribution of attentional modulation for visual cortex. Responses were recorded from 197 neurons in area V4 while monkeys performed a task that directed their attention towards or away from a stimulus in the receptive field of the neuron being recorded. Most neurons responded more strongly when the animal paid attention to the stimulus in the receptive field (average increase 26%, indicated by arrow). However, the distribution was broad, and some neurons responded more strongly when the animal directed its attention away from the receptive field. Response changes that were statistically significant are shown in black. (Data from McAdams & Maunsell (1999a).) of attentional modulation been shown to correlate with other properties of the neurons. Attentional modulation also differs between visual areas. Modulation by attention is typically weakest in the earliest stages of visual cortex, and strongest in the latest stages. This increase has not been studied extensively, but it is apparent in comparing results from different reports. The best data come from individual studies that have recorded from different cortical areas in the same animals while they performed a given task. Figure 2 shows the average attentional modulation in different cortical areas that were examined in this way in our laboratory. Average attentional modulation is plotted as a function of the level of cortical processing, as defined by the hierarchy of Felleman & Van Essen (1991) . In each study, areas at later stages had stronger average attentional modulation. These results were based on extracellular recording of individual action potentials, but stronger modulation at later stages of visual cortex has also been seen by using current source density measurements (Mehta et al. 2000) . It is not known why attentional modulations are stronger in later cortical levels. While it is tempting to imagine that neuronal activity related to attention accumulates in successive levels of processing, this seems unlikely given that sensory responses arriving from different sources do not appear to accumulate in this way. Similarly, the notion that neuronal signals related to attention are inserted at the latest stages of processing and diminish as they are fed back to earlier stages seems unlikely. It seems probable that the degree of modulation is optimized for each cortical level. There is little reason to believe that the cerebral cortex would be unable to prevent undesirable accumulation or diminution of signals that altered sensory responses. In addition to the range of attentional modulation seen within and between visual areas, individual neurons can show different degrees of attentional modulation depending on task demands. Task demand can be affected either by the number of relevant items or by the com- (2002) ). (Based on Cook & Maunsell (2002) .) plexity of the processing to be performed on the relevant items (Lavie & Tsal 1994; Urbach & Spitzer 1995; Sade & Spitzer 1998) . Mountcastle et al. (1981 Mountcastle et al. ( , 1987) ) showed that most neurons in area 7a and neighbouring regions were far more responsive when an animal was engaged in a visual task than when the same retinal stimuli were presented during periods of alert wakefulness when no fixation was required. Neuronal responses in inferotemporal cortex have also been found to be progressively stronger as a fixating animal goes from a situation where the stimulus is irrelevant, to monitoring the stimulus to detect its dimming, to discriminating the shape or texture of the stimulus (Spitzer & Richmond 1991) . Similarly, the responses of V4 neurons are stronger when an animal performs a more difficult version of an orientation change detection task (Spitzer et al. 1988) . The effects of task demand may be related to arousal or vigilance, but they can affect spatial attention. In some circumstances, modulation by spatial attention can be more than twice as strong during a difficult task (Boudreau & Maunsell 2001) . The attentional modulation of the responses of individual neurons can vary not only between tasks but also within trials. Motter (1994) provided a clear example of the dynamics of attention. He trained monkeys to do a task in which an instruction redirected their spatial attention in the middle of some trials. Neurons in V4 changed their responses within a few hundred milliseconds of the new instruction. Other studies have shown that attentional modulation can vary systematically during the course of task trials (e.g. McAdams & Maunsell 1999a; Reynolds et al. 2000) . These observations indicate that attentional modulation of individual neurons is dynamic, and varies over a time-course of no more than a few hundred milliseconds. In summary, attentional modulation of neuronal signals varies substantially within and between areas, and the modulation of individual neurons can vary depending on task demands, and probably other factors. This variable aspect of attentional modulations makes comparisons between different experiments problematic. It also means that there is little point in seeking a specific, fundamental value to describe the effect of attention on a neuron or area. Although attention substantially alters sensory responses (e.g. figures 1 and 2), it does not usually eliminate responses to unattended stimuli. Occasional neurons are described that respond only when the animal attends to the stimulus in their receptive field, but no report has described this as typical for neurons in a visual area. While it is likely that more neurons would show this sort of gating by attention in extremely demanding tasks, those tasks are not representative of the effort of most visual tasks. When animals perform tasks that approximate the attentional demands of everyday visual functions, attention substantially emphasizes the cortical representation of behaviourally relevant stimuli relative to others, but does not obliterate most signals about other stimuli. THE QUALITY OF MODULATIONS OF NEURONAL RESPONSES BY ATTENTION In addition to changing the magnitude of neuronal responses, attention might affect the information contained in the neuronal signal. For example, does attention change the preferred orientation or speed, or the sharpness of tuning for different stimulus attributes? The relationship between tuning for stimulus dimensions and the quality of information conveyed by a population of neurons is complex (Zhang & Sejnowski 1999) , and it is difficult to argue that attention should have a particular effect on selectivity to produce better behavioural performance. Nevertheless, it is important to examine whether changes in neuronal stimulus selectivity are associated with attention. Only a handful of studies have addressed this question, but they suggest that attention does not systematically alter the selectivity of neurons. Instead, attention appears to act by increasing the responsiveness of neurons without changing the selectivity or reliability of responses. McAdams & Maunsell (1999a) measured the orientation tuning of V4 neurons when attention was directed towards the orientation of a stimulus in their receptive fields, and when it was directed to the colour of a distant stimulus. Responses were stronger with attention directed to the receptive field, but responses to all orientations were increased by the same proportion. Figure 3 shows average orientation tuning curves for the two conditions in that study. Although responses were on average ca. 30% stronger when attention was directed to the receptive field, there was no systematic change in the sharpness of orientation tuning. Treue & Martı ´nez Trujillo (1999) similarly found that attention increased the strength of responses of neurons in MT but did not change the sharpness of their directional tuning. In V4, the spatial profiles of receptive fields appear to scale proportionally when attention is directed at different locations near the receptive field, without changing the shape of the receptive field profile (Connor et al. 1996 (Connor et al. , 1997)) . Additionally, orientation tuning curves measured in inferotemporal cortex Tuning curves for each cell were normalized to the peak response in the attended condition, and shifted left or right to bring each cell's preferred orientation into alignment. Gaussian functions were then fitted to the averaged data for each behavioural state. Dashed and dotted lines represent the average spontaneous activities in the attended and unattended states respectively. Although the amplitude of the normalized tuning curves changed markedly when the animal attended to the stimulus (amplitude: 0.46-0.60), the width did not ( = 37.8-37.5°. (Data from McAdams & Maunsell (1999a) .) using reward-contingent and non-reward-contingent stimuli differ in response strength but not in the sharpness of tuning (Vogels & Orban 1994) . Similarly, attention does not appear to alter the underlying reliability of cortical responses. When the same stimulus is presented many times, cortical neurons respond with different numbers of spikes for different presentations. This variability is captured by the relationship between the mean strength of a neuron's response and the variance of the response measured over many presentations of the same stimulus. In most cases, the variance of the spike counts is proportional, and generally close to, the mean spike count (e.g. Tolhurst et al. 1981; Geisler & Albrecht 1997) . Attention does not affect the relationship between the mean and variance of responses for neurons in area V4 (McAdams & Maunsell 1999b ). Although attention changes the average responsiveness of neurons, it does not alter the variance associated with a given level of response. While in many situations attention appears to increase the sensitivity of neurons without obviously affecting their underlying stimulus selectivity, there are cases where attention does alter selectivity. For example, Moran & Desimone (1985) described how attention altered the receptive fields of V4 neurons to emphasize the region around the stimulus to which the subject was attending (see also Luck et al. 1997) . A shift in a neuron's receptive field profile is not consistent with a simple change in its sensitivity. Nevertheless, a shift in receptive fields can be explained by simple changes in sensitivity that occur at earlier levels in cortical processing (see Maunsell & McAdams 2001) , and are consistent with a mechanism that increases responses to attended stimuli relative to others in the scene. While more stimulus dimensions and more visual areas must be examined before firm conclusions can be drawn, the results described above indicate that attention selectively enhances responses to attended stimuli, without changing the feature selectivity of the responsive neurons. This enhancement is similar to what occurs when neurons are presented with stimuli that are more intense, or better suited to the stimulus preferences of the neuron, such as better matched to a preferred colour or speed of motion. For example, increasing stimulus contrast typically makes a neuron's response stronger without changing its selectivity for orientation, direction, spatial frequency or stimulus position (Dean 1981; Holub & Morton-Gibson 1981; Sclar & Freeman 1982; Albrecht & Hamilton 1982; Skottun et al. 1987; Geisler & Albrecht 1997) . Similarly, selectivity for one stimulus dimension generally does not differ greatly between measurements made using a stimulus that is optimal or suboptimal for another stimulus dimension (see McAdams & Maunsell 1999a ); e.g. measurements of direction selectivity at an optimal and suboptimal speed, (Rodman & Albright 1987) , although there are exceptions (e.g. Roy & Wurtz 1990) . Attention also mimics the way that stimulus changes alter responses without affecting the relationship between response strength and response variance (Dean 1981; Tolhurst et al. 1983; Snowden et al. 1992) . The notion that attention acts in a manner similar to increasing stimulus intensity is supported by the recent results of Reynolds et al. (2000) . They measured responses of V4 neurons to stimuli of different contrasts, which were or were not attended by the subject. Attention increased neuronal responses in a manner that was similar to the effect of increasing the contrast of each stimulus by a given amount. ATTENTION, NEURONAL RESPONSES AND BEHAVIOURAL PERFORMANCE Attention does not appear to alter the nature or structure of the representations in cortex. Instead it serves to highlight particular stimuli within the existing representational framework. This observation suggests an explanation for the behavioural effects of selective visual attention. Focusing attention on a stimulus influences neuronal responses in a way that is similar to increasing stimulus intensity. Like attention, increased stimulus intensity results in neurons responding more strongly, but does not sharpen their tuning for different stimulus features. If the effect of attention on neurons was functionally equivalent to higher intensity or salience of the attended stimuli, the behavioural advantages associated with selective attention-better detection, discrimination and reaction time-might be explained by changes in the representations in sensory cerebral cortex. Thus, attention may make attended stimuli appear more intense or salient by enhancing their representations in sensory cortex. The possibility that changes in neuronal responses in sensory cortex can fully account for the behavioural advantages associated with attention raises an important question about the relationship between neuronal sensitivity and behavioural capabilities. As mentioned in § 1, studies that have compared neuronal and behavioural performance have often found that under appropriate conditions, the signals of individual neurons can be as reliable as the subject's behaviour in distinguishing between stim-Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2002) uli (see Parker & Newsome 1998) . Does the correspondence between neuronal and behavioural performance remain fixed when attention alters neuronal responses? We examined this question by comparing neuronal and behavioural responses between different attentional states (Cook & Maunsell 2002) . Because many studies of neuronal performance in visual cortex have been done in areas with directionally selective neurons, we trained two monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to do a motion detection task that made it possible to measure neuronal and behavioural responses to stimuli in conditions of high and low attention. The animal viewed a screen on which two patches of dynamic random dots appeared. At the start of each trial, there was no net motion in either patch of dots (0% motion coherence), and the animal's task was to rapidly release a lever when dots of either patch began to move coherently in one direction. The motion signal on each trial was randomly selected from preset levels of coherence. One of the patches filled the receptive field of the neuron being recorded, and coherent motion in either patch matched the preferred direction and speed of the neuron. Motion appeared in only one patch on each trial, and the animal was cued at the start of the trial as to which patch was likely to contain the motion. Critically, the cue was valid on only about 80% of the trials. On the remaining trials motion occurred at an uncued location. These invalidly cued trials made it possible to measure behavioural and neuronal responses to stimuli to which the animal directed relatively little attention (Posner 1980) . The behavioural performance of both animals showed that they used the cue on each trial to direct most of their attention to the patch of dots that was likely to contain the motion. Moderate motion coherence was typically detected on more than 80% of trials when it appeared in the cued location, but on fewer than 40% of trials when it appeared in the uncued location. (These behavioural data cannot distinguish whether the animal simultaneously attended to the cued and uncued locations with different amounts of attention allocated to each, or if instead all of its attention was assigned to one patch at any instant, with the proportion of time spent attending to each patch depending on the cue. However, the neurophysiological recordings indicate that the animal allocated different amounts of attention to the two patches, and that these amounts did not vary during the stimulus presentations (see Cook & Maunsell 2002 , figure 10 ).) We recorded from neurons in MT and VIP. We chose these areas because both contain neurons that respond selectively to motion. Responses from a typical MT neuron are shown in figure 4 . The filled symbols in figure 4a show the average response of the neuron to different levels of motion coherence in the receptive field when the animal had been cued to attend to that location. The dashed line shows the average level of response to the 0% motion stimulus that preceded the motion. As expected, stronger motion produced stronger responses. The open symbol shows the neuron's average response to the medium motion strength (15% coherence) in the receptive field on trials in which the animal had been instructed to attend to the other location. Although the same motion appeared in the receptive field, the response was weaker. While measurements of responses to unattended stimuli of dif-  The data from the cases when the animal attended to the location of the motion define a function, but the open symbol, from trials on which the animal's attention was directed away from the stimulus, does not lie on that function. Thus, directing attention away from the stimulus does not have the same effect as reducing motion coherence while keeping attention fixed. ferent motion coherences would have been valuable, it was not practical to collect those data because invalid cues had to be restricted to a small percentage of the trials. Figure 4b shows the animal's behavioural performance on the same trials on which the neuronal responses were recorded. The filled symbols plot performance when the animal was attending to the receptive field and the motion occurred there. The open symbol is the behavioural performance for detecting the onset of the medium motion coherence in the receptive field when attention had been directed to the other patch of random dots. Giving the animal an invalid cue caused performance to drop from ca. 85% correct to only ca. 25% correct. The question we wanted to address was whether the decreases in neuronal and behavioural performance caused by directing attention were the same as those that might have occurred by keeping attention fixed and reducing the motion strength: is behavioural performance the same for an attended, weak stimulus and an unattended, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2002) strong stimulus if they both produce the same neuronal response? To examine this, we converted the neuronal responses into a measure of performance using ROC analysis (Green & Swets 1966) . This analysis evaluates how well an ideal observer could detect the presence of motion if the only signal available were the spikes of the neuron. For this analysis, we counted spikes in 300 ms windows immediately before and after the onset of the motion, for each of the conditions. The ROC performance based on the neuronal signal is plotted in figure 4c as a function of motion coherence. ROC values run from 1.0, which corresponds to perfect performance, to 0.5, which corresponds to performance that is no better than guessing. The neuronal response to the medium motion coherence could support good performance when the receptive field location had been cued, and the neuronal performance was only slightly reduced when the same stimulus appeared with attention directed elsewhere (open symbol). One way to assess whether shifting attention is equivalent to changing stimulus strength is to plot neuronal and behavioural performance against one another, parameterized by the coherence of the motion. In figure 4d , each point represents the behavioural and neuronal performance for a particular motion coherence, as indicated by the numbers beside each point. If the effect of attention were equivalent to changing stimulus strength, then the point for the invalid cue should lie on the function described by the filled symbols. In this case, it does not: it lies substantially to the right of the function. Shifting attention modulated the neuronal response by less than would be needed to account for the modulation of behavioural performance. This result was typical for neurons in MT. The responses of most MT neurons were weakly affected by attention. The average modulation among 93 neurons was about a 15% change in response. Attention had a more pronounced effect on behavioural performance, and for most neurons the attentional modulation of the neuronal response was too small to account for the attentional modulation of the behavioural response. A different result was found in VIP. VIP receives input from MT (Maunsell & Van Essen 1983; Ungerleider & Desimone 1986) , and like MT, most of its neurons are direction selective (Colby et al. 1993; Cook & Maunsell 2002) . Most neurons in VIP had strong attentional modulation; too strong to match the behavioural modulation by attention. The responses of a representative VIP neuron are shown in figure 5 , which has the same format as figure Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2002) 4. Figure 5a shows that the neuron's responses were profoundly affected by attention. Although the neuron responded strongly to the medium motion coherence when the animal was attending to the receptive field, the same stimulus produced almost no response when the animal was attending elsewhere. The dashed and dotted lines show that attention also affected the response to the 0% motion. The response to unattended moderate motion was less than the response to the 0% coherent motion when it was attended. Although the neuron's responses were devastated when attention was directed elsewhere, in this particular case the animal's behaviour was only slightly reduced (figure 5b ). Plotting neuronal performance against behavioural performance showed that attention did not have the same effect as changes in the motion coherence of attended stimuli (figure 5d ). Unlike MT, however, the point for the unattended stimulus lies to the left of the function defined by the points for the attended stimuli. This means that the attentional modulation of the neuronal response was stronger than what would be expected based on the modulation of the behavioural response. The responses of most neurons in VIP were strongly modulated by attention, and it was common to find that the neuronal modulation was greater than the associated behavioural modulation. The responses of all the neurons recorded in MT and VIP are summarized in figure 6 . Data from each animal and each area are plotted separately. Each plot shows the average neuronal and behavioural performance associated with high, medium and low levels of motion coherence, and for the medium motion coherence when it was in the uncued location. For MT data from both animals, the means for the performance on the uncued condition lie to the right of the function defined by the cued condition, although by different amounts for the two animals. For VIP, the means for the performance on the uncued condition lie to the left of the function, although barely so for animal 1. The differences between the two animals arise in part from greater overall attentional modulation for animal 2. The average neuronal modulation for animal 2 was 28% for MT and 94% for VIP, compared with 12% for MT and 68% for VIP in animal 1. The analyses in figures 4-6 compare neuronal performance measured using ROC against behavioural performance measured as a percentage of stimuli correctly detected. Might different measures reveal a better correspondence between neuronal and behavioural, or better correspondence between the animals? For example, neuronal response might be measured as absolute or relative rate of firing, and behavioural response might be measured as reaction time. We have tested these and other measures of neuronal and behavioural performance. Different analyses change the shapes of the functions and shift the Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2002) unattended points slightly left or right, but none changed the qualitative appearance of the results shown in figure 6 (see Cook & Maunsell 2002) . We do not believe that any analysis could bring all the unattended points onto the functions defined by the attended points. These results show that the relationship between neuronal response and behavioural performance can be changed by attention. Although attention substantially affected behavioural performance, it had relatively little effect on the responsiveness of MT neurons. Thus, similar levels of neuronal performance in MT were associated with different levels of behavioural performance. In VIP, the relationship between neuronal response and performance was also affected by attention, but in this case the attention affected neuronal performance more than behavioural performance. While there are several possible reasons for this outcome, differences in the amount of attentional modulation across visual cortex provide a probable explanation. Attentional modulation of neuronal responses is greater in later stages of cortical processing (figure 2 ). Although the origin of this difference is not known, it should have consequences for the relationship between neuronal and behavioural performance. If stimulus-response functions are VIP; and (d ) animal 2, VIP. ROC analysis was carried out using 300 ms periods immediately before and after the onset of medium motion coherence when it occurred in the cued location. The median values for the MT were 0.80 and 0.82 for animals 1 and 2, and the median values for the VIP were 0.78 and 0.72 respectively. Thus, the performance of MT neurons was slightly superior. The MT performance was also better for low and high motion coherence. similar between areas (as they are for MT and VIP; figures 4a and 5a), then a given change in behavioural performance caused by changes in attention will be matched only by a specific change in neuronal response. Because attentional modulation varies between areas, a match between the change in neuronal response and behaviour can be centred only on a particular level of cortical processing. It is possible that the neurons at some level between MT and VIP had an average attentional modulation that was well matched to the average behavioural modulation. If so, then neurons in this region might have responses that closely matched behavioural performance across manipulations of either stimulus strength or attentional state. The notion that behavioural performance might be most closely associated with neurons that are intermediate in cortical processing raises the question of why behaviours would not be based on the neurons with the greatest attentional modulation. The answer is probably that the neurons with the greatest attentional modulation do not have response properties that are optimal for the task. Neurons with the greatest attentional modulation typically lie at the highest levels of cortical processing, and have complex response properties. For example, although neurons in both MT and VIP are directionally selective, VIP neurons have more elaborate response properties. VIP neurons respond to several types of visual and extraretinal Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2002) signals, including optic flow patterns, tactile stimulation of the face, vestibular stimulation, and the position of the eyes in the orbits (Schaafsma & Duysens 1996; Schaafsma et al. 1997; Colby & Goldberg 1999) . Although these neurons are strongly modulated by attention, their specialization for these more complex response properties is likely to make them less reliable than other neurons for detecting the onset of the motion used in the experiments described here. An analysis of the responses we collected from MT and VIP indicates that neurons in VIP are not better suited than MT neurons for detecting the motion used in our task. Figure 7 shows distributions of neuronal performance for the two areas. A broad range of performance was found in both areas, but in both animals the median performance was slightly better for MT. These distributions are based on responses to the medium motion coherence when it appeared in the cued location, but MT performance was also better for the other levels of motion coherence. Thus, neurons at later levels of cortical processing are not necessarily better suited for all tasks. We know of no data that strongly suggest that behavioural performance should always depend on neurons in the highest levels of visual cortex. Basing performance on those representations would introduce a substantial restriction, because far fewer neurons would be available if only the highest levels are accessed. Rather than depending on those neurons that are most modulated by attention, behavioural performance is likely to be based on those neurons with response properties that provide the most sensitive signals for the current task. This suggestion is consistent with observations on perceptual learning that indicate that earlier or later cortical levels are involved in learning different types of visual discriminations (Ahissar & Hochstein 1997) . In the case of our motion detection task, neurons with the greatest sensitivity might be found at a level intermediate to MT and VIP, and behaviours might be most closely linked to the performance of those neurons. Were that the case, it would be natural for behaviour to be modulated by attention to the same extent that those best-suited neurons were modulated by attention. If, in a different task, behavioural performance was best served by representations in later stages of visual cortex, where attentional modulation is strong, we would expect that behaviour would be more susceptible to attentional modulation. CONCLUSION More data will be needed before we will know whether the relationship between neuronal and behavioural performance persists across attentional states for any region of the visual cortex. Nevertheless, the results described here indicate that a correspondence across attention states will be limited to a restricted level of processing, the location of which will vary depending on the task being performed. Even if neurons at a given level do preserve a fixed relationship between neuronal and behavioural performance across attentional states for a task, it would not necessarily mean that those neurons were more or less important than others for performing the task. Similarly, it would say nothing about how large a pool of neurons contribute to a decision. A cortical region that had a close match would be a good candidate for being the centre of the relevant neurons, but the pool size might be large or small without appreciably affecting the mean neuronal performance. Additionally, a correspondence between average neuronal performance and average behavioural performance would not reveal which cortical region was most involved, because behavioural performance might be based on the best neurons in a population, rather than the average (see Parker & Newsome 1998) . Much remains to be learned about how the activity of individual neurons is translated into behavioural decisions. Nevertheless, progress in this area is essential for understanding how the brain works. Manipulation of attention may prove to be a valuable approach to exploring how neurons contribute to particular behaviours. Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3. Average normalized tuning curves for 262 V4 neurons tested when the stimulus was attended (filled symbols) or ignored (open symbols).Tuning curves for each cell were normalized to the peak response in the attended condition, and shifted left or right to bring each cell's preferred orientation into alignment. Gaussian functions were then fitted to the averaged data for each behavioural state. Dashed and dotted lines represent the average spontaneous activities in the attended and unattended states respectively. Although the amplitude of the normalized tuning curves changed markedly when the animal attended to the stimulus (amplitude: 0.46-0.60), the width did not ( = 37.8-37.5°. (Data fromMcAdams & Maunsell  (1999a).) Figure 4 . 4 Figure 4. Responses of a representative MT neuron. (a) Responses to motion stimuli with different levels of coherence.Motion coherence corresponds to the strength of the motion signal. At 0% coherence, there is no net motion. Each filled circle is the average response during the first 300 ms after the onset of motion with the coherence indicated. The dashed line is the average response to the 0% coherence stimulus that appeared before the onset of coherent motion. The open circle is the response to 15% coherent motion in the receptive field that appeared on trials when the animal's attention had been directed away from the receptive field. The dotted line is the response to 0% coherent motion in those trials. Error bars in all panels are the standard errors of the means, and are sometimes smaller than the symbols. As expected, directing attention away from the receptive field reduced neuronal responses. (b) Behavioural performance for the same trials used to collect the neuronal responses. The open circle shows that the animal's ability to detect the 15% coherent stimulus was greatly reduced when its attention was directed away from the location of the motion. (c) Neuronal performance. Neuronal responses were converted into performance using ROC based on 300 ms immediately before and after the onset of motion. (d ) The data from (b and c) are replotted parameterized by motion coherence. The value by each symbol gives the associated motion coherence. The data from the cases when the animal attended to the location of the motion define a function, but the open symbol, from trials on which the animal's attention was directed away from the stimulus, does not lie on that function. Thus, directing attention away from the stimulus does not have the same effect as reducing motion coherence while keeping attention fixed. Figure 5 . 5 Figure 5.

Each panel is a plot of neuronal versus behavioural performance in the form shown in figures 4d and 5d.

Error bars are the standard errors of the means.Open circles are performance for the medium coherence when the subject's attention was directed away from the stimulus. Although the subjects differed somewhat, the unattended points for the MT are both to the right of the functions for the attended stimuli, and the unattended points for the VIP are both to the left of the functions for the attended stimuli. The effects of attention are not readily equated to changes in motion coherence. Figure 7 . 7 Figure 7. Neuronal performance detecting the onset of stimulus motion.

The median values for the MT were 0.80 and 0.82 for animals 1 and 2, and the median values for the VIP were 0.78 and 0.72 respectively. Thus, the performance of MT neurons was slightly superior. The MT performance was also better for low and high motion coherence. Phil. Trans. R.Soc. Lond.

Introduction The serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT 2A receptor (5-HT 2A R) is a GPCR of the type A family. It was defined as the classical D receptor initially by Gaddum and Picarelli (1957) , and later referred as the 5-HT 2 receptor by Peroutka and Snyder (1979) . The 5-HT 2A R gene is located on human chromosome 13q14-q21. HTR2A gene codes for a 471-amino acid sequence in rat, mouse, and human (Sparkes et al., 1991) . The rat 5-HT 2A R was cloned in 1988 (Pritchett et al., 1988) and the human 5-HT 2A R was reported by Julius et al. (1990) . Central 5-HT 2A Rs exert diverse behavioral, physiological, and psychological influences (Hoyer et al., 2002; Hannon and Hoyer, 2008; Homberg, 2012) . Abnormality in the structure and function of the 5-HT 2A R is associated with a number of disorders, including schizophrenia, depression/anxiety, and drug addiction. Furthermore, many hallucinogenic drugs exert their psychoactive effects by acting as agonists for 5-HT 2A Rs. Preclinical studies show that 5-HT 2A R blockade has antipsychotic (Meltzer, 1999) , antidepressant (Kroeze and Roth, 1998; Roth et al., 1998) and anxiolytic properties (Cohen, 2005) . Pharmacological studies indicate that high-affinity antagonists of 5-HT 2A Rs are effective atypical antipsychotics, due to their demonstrated efficacy to reduce both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Results from recent molecular biological and neuropharmacological studies suggest some exciting potential new avenues by which 5-HT 2A Rs influence CNS function. Here we review progress in understanding the contribution of 5-HT 2A Rs to modulation of learning and memory through an analysis of their (1) anatomy and biology: distribution, signaling, polymerization, and allosteric modulation; and (2) functions: learning and memory, hallucination and spatial cognition, and mental disorders. Based on the recent progress in 5-HT 2A R research, we suggest that selective 5-HT 2A R modulators targeting distinct signaling pathways may hold significant efficacy as new therapeutic approaches for several neurological disorders that present with cognitive impairment. 5-HT 2A R Anatomy and Biology in CNS Cellular and Subcellular Distribution Serotonin 5-HT 2A Rs are widely distributed in the CNS. In the rat brain, immunohistochemical studies show that 5-HT 2A Rs are broadly expressed in the cerebral cortex -especially in layers I and IV-V, the piriform and entorhinal cortex, the claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, and olfactory bulb/anterior olfactory nucleus, brainstem, as well as the limbic system and the basal ganglia; especially in the NAc and caudate nucleus (Xu and Pandey, 2000; Hannon and Hoyer, 2008) . Interestingly, 5-HT 2A R binding appears to be absent from cerebellum (Xu and Pandey, 2000) . In human brain, autoradiographic analysis using [ 3 H] ketanserin indicates a high density of 5-HT 2A R binding in laminae III and V of the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, anterogenual cortexes, and entorhinal area. 5-HT 2A Rs are also visualized in the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus, claustrum, and the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. The hippocampus, caudate, putamen, and accumbens nuclei present an intermediate density of binding. Areas such as the thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord contained only low to very low densities of binding (Pazos et al., 1987) . In situ hybridization studies reveal that 5-HT 2A R mRNA is present in all neocortical areas, especially in layer 5 pyramidal neurons, and in putative interneurons. 5-HT 2A R mRNA was observed at minimal levels in the hippocampus and not in the raphe, cerebellum, substantia nigra or striatum (Burnet et al., 1995) . Morphological and double immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the presence of 5-HT 2A Rs on pyramidal neurons, interneurons, and glial cells in neocortex, amygdala and hippocampus (Willins et al., 1997; Bombardi, 2012 Bombardi, , 2014)) . Thus, predicting the functional influence of activated cortical 5-HT 2A Rs is not straightforward, since these receptors would be capable of direct excitation and modulating feed-forward inhibition. In addition, 5-HT 2A Rs are located on cholinergic (Quirion et al., 1985) and glutamatergic neurons (Hasuo et al., 2002) . 5-HT 2A R immunolabeling was also observed on glial cells in many forebrain regions: astrocytes were identified by double immunolabeling as cells in which 5-HT 2A R and GFAP was colocalized (Xu and Pandey, 2000) ; and on microglia (Glebov et al., 2015) . These findings demonstrate that consideration of the serotonin-mediated signaling at 5-HT 2A Rs must include pathways that involve neurons and glial cells alike. It will be of interest to determine the degree to which functional influences expressed by the activation of 5-HT 2A Rs are dependent upon neurons, astrocytes, and microglial cells, and to determine whether clinically relevant features of 5-HT 2A Rs are related to changes in neurons or astrocytes. At the subcellular level, 5-HT 2A R immunolabeling is found on cell bodies and processes of neurons (Cornea-Hebert et al., 1999; Xu and Pandey, 2000) ; in particular, at both pre-and post-synaptic compartments (Miner et al., 2003) . However, the majority of evidence suggests a predominant expression at postsynaptic dendritic spines and shafts of non-5-HT neurons. Our own immuno-electron microscopy data revealed that 5-HT 2A R is also distributed in the dendritic spines, shafts, and presynaptic terminals of CA1 neurons in the mouse dorsal hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2015) . Consideration should also be given to evidence suggesting that 5-HT 2A R subunits are extensively and dynamically trafficked between the cytoplasm and the neuronal membrane, as much 5-HT 2A R label has been identified at cytoplasmic rather than membrane bound compartments in adult rat neocortex (Cornea-Hebert et al., 1999) . It will be of interest to determine the corresponding function of 5-HT 2A R subunit trafficking between the respective neuronal sub-compartments, and the intracellular signaling that promotes trafficking. Interacting Proteins Multiple interacting proteins regulate the function of 5-HT 2A Rs in the membrane. 5-HT 2A Rs interact with multiple PDZ protein-1 (MUPP1) and PSD-95 PDZ proteins (Jones et al., 2009) . The 5-HT 2A R colocalizes with PSD-95 and with MUPP1 in a subset of dendritic spines of rat cortical pyramidal neurons. PDZ proteins are vital for docking 5-HT 2A R to the dendrites in cortical neurons and preventing the internalization of 5-HT 2A Rs (Xia et al., 2003) . MUPP1 is enriched in dendritic spine PSD domains of pyramidal neurons and enhances the localization of 5-HT 2A R to the cell surface. Within cortical pyramidal neurons, PSD-95 regulates the functional activity of 5-HT 2A R by promoting apical dendritic targeting and stabilizing receptor turnover. The complex of 5-HT 2A R and PSD-95 plays a key role in 5-HT 2A R-mediated head-twitch behavior in mice (Abbas et al., 2009) . Binding of calmodulin to the 5-HT 2A R C-terminus impedes PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the 5-HT 2A R, thus, preventing its desensitization (Turner and Raymond, 2005) . Conversely, association of p90-RSK2 with 5-HT 2A R (intracellular 3 loop) silences the GPCR's signaling (Sheffler et al., 2006) . Caveolin-1 interacts with 5-HT 2A R and profoundly modulates its signaling by facilitating the interaction of 5-HT 2A R with Gαq (Bhatnagar et al., 2004) . 5-HT 2A R and the light chain 2 domain of the microtubule-associated protein MAP1A are co-localized in the intracellular compartment of pyramidal neuronal dendrites of adult rats and may participate in intraneuronal signaling processes involving cytoskeletal elements (Cornea-Hebert et al., 2002) . In consideration of these properties, we suggest that altering 5-HT 2A R-coupled proteins and pathways may enable an alternative method to selectively promote distinct modulatory functions of 5-HT 2A Rs. Signaling Activation of neuronal 5-HT 2A Rs can induce pleiotropic effects via G protein-dependent, ligand-dependent, and ligandindependent signaling pathways, including phospholipase signaling, ERK pathway, and tyrosine kinase pathway in neurons (Millan et al., 2008; Masson et al., 2012) . In most circumstances, activation of 5-HT 2A Rs increases intracellular Ca 2+ levels via G αq -PLC-IP3 signaling (Hagberg et al., 1998) . In PFC, activation of 5-HT 2A Rs suppresses membrane Ca v 1.2 L-type Ca 2+ currents via a G αq -mediated PLCβ/IP 3 /calcineurin signaling pathway (Day et al., 2002) . 5-HT 2A R activation also stimulates the G α12/13 -phospholipase A2 signal transduction pathway, which promotes arachidonic acid release (Kurrasch-Orbaugh et al., 2003a,b) . Besides PLC-mediated Ca 2+ signaling, 5-HT 2A R activation also induces ERK phosphorylation via diverse intracellular signaling mechanisms (Gooz et al., 2006) . Src and calmodulin promote 5-HT2AR-mediated phosphorylation of ERK. In the PC12 cell model system, ERK phosphorylation by 5-HT 2A R may not depend on PLC/PKC signaling, and instead requires an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ , and the activation of CaM and Src (Quinn et al., 2002) . The ERK target RSK2 directly acts on the third intracellular (i3) loop of 5-HT 2A R protein (Sheffler et al., 2006) , leading to direct phosphorylation of the i3 loop at the conserved residue Ser-314 to suppress 5-HT 2A R signaling. In addition, RSK2 is required for tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, both of which have been demonstrated to attenuate 5-HT 2A R functioning in primary cortical neurons (Strachan et al., 2009 (Strachan et al., , 2010)) . Besides the G protein, 5-HT 2A Rs are also coupled to β-arrestin2. 5-HT binds 5-HT 2A R to stimulate Akt phosphorylation via the β-arrestin2/phosphoinositide 3kinase/Src/Akt cascade (Schmid and Bohn, 2010) . Application of the 5-HT 2A R agonist DOI to cultured cortical neurons induced phosphorylation of p21-activated kinase (PAK) via Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RacGEF) kalirin-7 (Jones et al., 2009) . The 5-HT 2A R also regulates the tyrosine kinase pathway activity (Quinn et al., 2002) . Excitation of neuronal 5-HT 2A Rs activates transglutaminase which leads to transamidation of Rac1, a small G protein, resulting in constitutive activation of Rac1 (Dai et al., 2008) . Chronic treatment with olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, causes the desensitization of 5-HT 2A R signaling. In rat frontal cortex, stimulation of the JAK-STAT pathway desensitizes the 5-HT 2A R-mediated PLC activation induced by olanzapine (Singh et al., 2010) . Furthermore, constitutive activation of 5-HT 2A Rs induces G q/11 phosphorylation and desensitization (uncoupling) (Shi et al., 2007) . As indicated above, 5-HT 2A Rs are also expressed in microglia and mediate 5-HT-induced exosome release (Glebov et al., 2015) . Activation of 5-HT 2A R increases intracellular Ca 2+ via PLC signaling in astrocytes (Hagberg et al., 1998) and Glu efflux from C6 glioma cells (Meller et al., 2002) . Considering the diversity of signaling cascades that can be triggered by 5-HT 2A R activation, it is perhaps not surprising that serotonergic activation of 5-HT 2A Rs can have diverse influences on neuronal responses and CNS functions. Oligomerization The GPCRs can form homomers and heteromers, and thereby present distinct signaling and functional activities (Rios et al., 2001) . Consistent with this, 5-HT 2A Rs have been shown to form oligomers (Lukasiewicz et al., 2010) . Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the human 5-HT 2A R homodimerizes in cultured cells (Brea et al., 2009) . For 5-HT 2A R oligomers, the 5-HT 2A R agonist DOI caused an increase in energy transfer efficiency to the level of 12%, and ketanserin caused a decrease of 4.4%. Heterodimers of 5-HT 2A R and dopamine D 2 receptors respond to DOI and quinpirole, a DA D 2 R agonist, with a decrease in FRET efficiency, while ketanserin and butaclamol increase the transfer efficiency value (Lukasiewicz et al., 2010) . Heterodimers of 5-HT 2A R and mGluR2 receptor form via the linking domain in transmembrane-4 and -5 segments, and are present in the human brain. Post-mortem studies indicate a reduced density of these functional complexes in brains of schizophrenics (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2008) . Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound of marijuana, induces memory impairments, anxiety, dependence, and analgesia. Vinals et al. (2015) recently reported that amnesic and anxiolytic effects, but not analgesia, induced by THC were suppressed in 5-HT 2A R knockout mice. Molecular studies revealed that cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1R) and the 5-HT 2A R physically interact with each other to form heteromers, which are distributed extensively in hippocampus, cortex, and dorsal striatum, but not in the NAc. In vivo experiments have revealed that stimulation of CB1R and 5-HT 2A R reduces cell signaling, and the binding of an antagonist to one receptor blocks signaling of the interacting receptor. Heteromer formation leads to a switch in 5-HT 2A Rmediated G-protein coupling from G αq to G i . Synthetic peptides with the sequence of transmembrane helices 5 and 6 of CB1R disrupt CB1R and 5-HT 2A R heteromerization in vivo, leading to a selective abrogation of memory impairments, but not the antinociceptive properties caused by THC exposure (Vinals et al., 2015) . The anatomy, biology and function of 5-HT 2A R homomers and heteromers, including the dynamic formation and dissociation, distribution, signaling and function, remain elusive. Elucidation of 5-HT 2A R oligomers will be interesting for both basic science research and potential clinical applications. Allosteric Modulation Recent years have witnessed a tremendous advance in the research and development of novel compounds for GPCRs that bind allosteric sites to regulate receptor structure and function. These ligands provide high specificity, novel modes of efficacy and may open up a novel avenue for therapeutic agents against multiple mental and neurological disorders. Allosteric modulators bind to a site distinct from that of the orthosteric ligand-binding site. Usually the allosteric modulator induces a structure change within the GPCR to enhance or suppress the orthosteric ligand's functional activity (Conn et al., 2009; Melancon et al., 2012) . Application of the amidated lipid, oleamide significantly potentiated 5-HT-induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositide in pituitary P11 cells expressing endogenously 5-HT 2A Rs (Thomas et al., 1997) . Taken together, these results indicate that there are several binding sites present on 5-HT 2A Rs, and we suggest that it will be of interest to further characterize the functional significance of the distinct ligand-driven actions at the 5-HT 2A R. Constitutive Activity As mentioned above, 5-HT 2A Rs can also be constitutively active (i.e., via activating the receptor in an agonist-independent activity) in vivo (Berg et al., 2008) . The inverse 5-HT 2A R agonists (e.g., risperidone and ketanserin) produce a great suppression of basal IP production, leading to a reduction of basal activity in the C322K mutant 5-HT 2A R (Egan et al., 1998) . The "constitutively active" arrestin mutant (Arr2-R169E) induces agonist-independent 5-HT 2A R internalization, and a constitutive translocation of the Arr2-R169E mutant to the plasma membrane (Gray et al., 2003) . The constitutive activity of 5-HT 2A Rs may represent another mechanism of regulating cellular function. The specific relationships of these constitutively active 5-HT 2A R-mediated properties to distinct behaviors have not been determined. Electrophysiological Characteristics Electrophysiological studies reveal complex effects of 5-HT 2A R activation on cortical neurons; however, mainly these receptors appear to mediate depolarizing effects on excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Slice recordings from prefrontal cortical neurons indicate depolarizing effects following 5-HT 2A R activation (Aghajanian and Marek, 1999; Zhou and Hablitz, 1999; Avesar and Gulledge, 2012) . Local application of DOI, a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor agonist, increases the firing rates of cortical neurons (Stein et al., 2000) and facilitates synaptic plasticity through an NMDAR-dependent mechanism in presumptive pyramidal neurons of the rat BLA (Chen et al., 2003) . Meanwhile, α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (a 5-HT 2 R agonist) and DOI induce activation of GABAergic interneurons of the rat BLA (Stein et al., 2000) . Double immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated that the 5-HT 2A R is primarily localized to parvalbumin-containing BLA interneurons. Accordingly, 5-HT primarily acts on 5-HT 2A Rs to potentiate GABAergic inhibition. 5-HT 2A R activation increases the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs recorded from the pyramidal neurons in BLA of the juvenile rat (Jiang et al., 2009) . DOI potentiates NMDAR-mediated changes in membrane potentials and calcium influx without affecting the neuronal resting membrane potential or input resistance. However, DOI does not affect AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic responses (Chen et al., 2003) . The relationship of 5-HT 2A Rs to NMDARs is consistent with the view that 5-HT 2A Rs may be an effective target for modulating experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in the CNS. Globally, 5-HT 2A Rs have been shown to influence low-frequency field potential oscillations in rat frontal cortex (Celada et al., 2008) . Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the 5-HT 2A R mediates 5-HT-induced excitation of cortical neurons. However, much remains to be determined as to the neurophysiological consequences of 5-HT 2A R activation, in particular as they relate to the regulation of specific behaviors. Recent molecular and pharmacological research has made significant advances in the understanding of the functional selectivity of 5-HT 2A R. The multiple signaling pathways suggests bias agonism and bias signaling of 5-HT 2A Rs, which posit that an agonist can produce a mix of signaling, which is potentially determined by cell type and functional status. 5-HT 2A R Functions in CNS Long-term declarative or episodic memory is supported by a network of brain structures in the medial temporal lobe of the mammalian brain. The medial temporal lobe memory system, which includes the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and surrounding extrahippocampal cortical regions, influence decision-making processes guided by the PFC, and posterior parietal cortex (Squire et al., 2004 (Squire et al., , 2007;; Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013) . Serotonergic fibers originating from the raphe nuclei innervate many of the critical nodes within the medial temporal lobe memory system, including the hippocampus and amygdala, and on to the PFC (Vertes, 1991; Vertes et al., 1999) . The modulatory influence of 5-HT on simple and more complex forms of learning and memory has been extensively examined in both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems (Kandel and Squire, 2000) . The relevance of 5-HT to memory seems to generalize across mammals:, dietary tryptophan increases brain 5-HT levels and improves memory in rodents (Khaliq et al., 2006) , the elderly, AD patients, and schizophrenics (Levkovitz et al., 2003; Porter et al., 2003) . Further, reductions in brain 5-HT concentrations after acute or chronic tryptophan depletion has been demonstrated to impair contextual fear memory in mice (Uchida et al., 2007) , object memory in rats (Jenkins et al., 2009) , and declarative memory in humans (Schmitt et al., 2006) . Below, we describe some evidence suggesting that the 5-HT 2A R may hold special significance as one of the substrates by which 5-HT regulates learning and memory (Meneses, 2007) . Learning and Memory Polymorphisms in the human HTR2A gene are associated with altered memory processes. For example, a HTR2A gene polymorphism inducing the substitution of the His452 on the receptor subunit to a Tyr residue is associated with a significant impairment in memory recall amongst adults (de Quervain et al., 2003; Sigmund et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2013) . Carriers of the His452Tyr (rs6314) exhibited poor verbal delayed recall and recognition, but performed equivalent to controls on tests of immediate recall, attentional, and executive function (Wagner et al., 2008) . Compared to His homozygotes, Tyr carriers exhibited a diminished hippocampal response to novel stimuli and a higher tendency to judge novel stimuli as familiar during delayed recognition (Schott et al., 2011) . Amongst schizophrenics and healthy controls, those carriers of homozygous CC (T102C) and GG (A-1438G), or carriers of the so-called T-allele (rs6314), of the HTR2A gene polymorphisms exhibited significantly impaired short-term verbal memory (Alfimova et al., 2009) , and spatial working memory (Blasi et al., 2013) . Another polymorphism in the HTR2A gene, referred to as rs4941573 was found to be predictive of increased error rate in a spatial working memory task in an adult Chinese subject population (Gong et al., 2011) . These results provide just a brief and incomplete view of a broad literature indicating the impressive degree to which alterations in the HTR2A gene relate to disordered cognitive functions in normal and abnormal human subjects. The regional distribution of 5-HT 2A Rs can be predictive of the memory capacities that are sensitive to serotonin manipulation. The 5-HT 2A Rs are widely expressed in the neocortex and hippocampus of rats (Xu and Pandey, 2000; Hannon and Hoyer, 2008) , rabbits (Aloyo and Harvey, 2000) , primates (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998; Lopez-Gimenez et al., 1998) , and humans (Hoyer et al., 1986; Lopez-Gimenez et al., 1998) . Table 1 summarizes the major findings of studies in which the learning and memory effects were examined after 5-HT 2A R pharmacological manipulations across distinct tasks and different species. The inconsistency of experimental results may be attributed to the species, selectivity and dose of drug, behavioral task and other effectors. Object Memory The spontaneous NOR task, which relies on rodents' inherent preference for exploring novel over familiar stimuli, has become a popular method for examining the neuropharmacological and neurophysiological mechanisms of object memory (Ennaceur, 2010; Cohen and Stackman, 2015) . In the task, rodents are exposed to one or two novel objects in a familiar enclosure during a sample session (i.e., training). The rodent is removed from the enclosure after it has sufficiently explored the objects. After a delay of some length, the rodent is returned to the enclosure for a memory test session, during which the enclosure contains one familiar object and a novel object. If the rodent has successfully encoded and consolidated the memory of the original object from the sample session, then it is expected that the rodent will preferentially explore the novel object during the test session. The NOR task offers advantages for testing rodent memory in that the distinct memory processes of encoding, consolidation and retrieval are operationally defined as events occurring during the sample session, after the sample session, or during the test session, respectively. Another advantage is that the behavioral responses are spontaneous rather than requiring overt motivation such as electrical shock or food restriction. Our recent studies implicate the hippocampus as a key region in the rodent brain for object memory processes (Cohen et al., 2013; Cohen and Stackman, 2015) . In light of the fact that 5-HT 2A Rs are densely expressed in the hippocampus (Luttgen et al., 2004) , we examined the contribution of hippocampal 5-HT 2A Rs in object memory processes in male mice using an NOR task (see Figure 1 ). Systemic activation of 5-HT 2A Rs with the selective agonist, TCB-2 after the sample session significantly enhanced the time mice spent exploring the new object presented during the test session 24 h later (Zhang et al., 2013) . The memoryenhancing effect of TCB-2, was blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT 2A R antagonist, MDL 11,939, which suggests that 5-HT 2A R activation enhances the consolidation of object memory. Interestingly, when TCB-2 was administrated before the sample session, or before the test session, the 5-HT 2A R agonist failed to increase novel object preference relative to the respective control group. Together, these data suggest that 5-HT 2A R activation selectively potentiates memory consolidation. Furthermore, the selective local microinfusion of TCB-2 into the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus recapitulated the memory enhancing effect observed after systemic treatment (Zhang et al., 2015) . The relevance of the 5-HT 2A R for object memory processes was also demonstrated by results of a study showing that the local infusion of the 5-HT 2A R antagonist MDL 11,939 into the mPFC impaired retrieval of object-in-context memory in rats (Bekinschtein et al., 2013) . Interestingly, the 5-HT 2A R agonist DOI was found to impair retrieval of memory for an operant response by adult rats in an autoshaping task (Meneses, 2007) . Thus, it would appear that the influence of the 5-HT 2A R on memory is taskand memory system-dependent, and perhaps by the underlying neural circuitry that supports the respective memory process. The encoding and consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memory appears, in part, to require fast glutamatergic neurotransmission, ensuing phases of synaptic plasticity, and dynamic replay of experience-dependent neurophysiological oscillatory activity within hippocampal cell populations (Eichenbaum, 1999; Karlsson and Frank, 2009) . Our published (Zhang et al., 2013) data show that post-training activation of 5-HT 2A R s enhances object memory, likely by affecting consolidation. Prevailing views state that the hippocampus transfers recent to-be-remembered information to the neocortex during sharp wave ripples of the hippocampal local field potential (i.e., 100-200 Hz ripples; Chrobak and Buzsaki, 1996; Carr et al., 2011) . During sleep, hippocampal neurons 'replay' patterns of spike trains present during a learning episode. As sharp wave ripples and replay may represent systems consolidation of memory, it would be of interest to examine the influence of 5-HT 2A R-sensitive drugs on sharp wave ripples and replay of spiking sequences during sleep episodes after a to-be-remembered experience. Postsynaptic 5-HT 2A Rs may modulate object memory consolidation by also influencing NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity. Consistent with this possibility, hippocampal 5-HT 2A Rs are predominantly expressed at dendritic sites on pyramidal neurons (Cornea-Hebert et al., 1999; Peddie et al., 2008) . 5-HT 2A R-containing dendritic processes also were immunolabeled for the NMDAR subunit NR1 and GluR2 (Peddie et al., 2008) . We have found that 5-HT 2A R activation increased the extracellular efflux of glutamate in the dorsal hippocampus, and increased the basal firing rates of CA1 pyramidal neurons in awake behaving mice (Zhang et al., 2015) . These results suggest that the 5-HT 2A R activation induced facilitation of object memory consolidation, may result from the potentiation of hippocampal glutamate release, and pyramidal neuron temporal dynamics at a critical post-training time period. These data suggest that the 5HT 2A R may serve as a drug target for pharmacological interventions to treat memory impairments. It is conceivable that 5-HT 2A R activation promotes an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ , combined with NMDAR-mediated Ca 2+ influx, which together would facilitate the behavior-initiated synaptic plasticity. Aghajanian and Marek (1999) reported that activation of 5-HT 2A R produces an elevation in the frequency and amplitude of neuronal sEPSP/sEPSC. Consistently, 5-HT 2A R activation has been shown to facilitate NMDAR activity and synaptic plasticity in the cortex (Arvanov et al., 1999) and BLA (Chen et al., 2003) . Furthermore, 5-HT 2A R directly interacts with PSD-95 to regulate receptor trafficking and signaling (Xia et al., 2003) . 5-HT 2A R activation induces a transient increase in dendritic spinogenesis (Yoshida et al., 2011) , phosphorylation of PAK, neuronal Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Jones et al., 2009) , BDNF expression (Vaidya et al., 1997) , and Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (Florian and Watts, 1998; Watts, 1998) . Finally, the 5-HT 2A R inverse agonist pimavanserin was shown to reverse NMDAR antagonism-induced object memory impairments in combination with atypical antipsychotic drugs (Snigdha et al., 2010) . These results support the view of a modulatory influence of 5-HT 2A R on NMDAR-dependent memory mechanisms. Considering the myriad potential influences of 5-HT 2A R on medial temporal lobe memory mechanisms, there would appear to be multiple downstream influences by which 5-HT 2A R activation could enhance memory. Fear Memory While there is a rich literature on the influence of serotonin on anxiety and an established contribution of serotonergic drugs to the remediation of anxiety disorders in humans, the present review will focus on the influence of 5-HT 2A Rs on fear memory encoded during Pavlovian conditioning sessions. Pavlovian fear conditioning has become a popular procedure for examining the neurobiological mechanisms of fear memory. As a Pavlovian conditioning procedure, fear conditioning lends itself well to defining processes of encoding, consolidation and retrieval of fear memory. Fear conditioning taxes a well-defined neural circuit within the amygdala, which in turn interacts with the hippocampus, anterior cingulate, or the PFC, depending on the elements of the conditioning session and the stage of memory processing (Zelikowsky et al., 2014) . In addition, considerable attention has been given to investigations of the underlying biology of extinction of fear memory. During a delay fear conditioning session, an innocuous stimulus (e.g., a neutral tone or light) becomes a CS when it is repeatedly presented in such a way that it co-terminates with the presentation of a sufficiently aversive US (e.g., foot shock) (Zhang et al., 2013) . The unconditioned response to the foot shock US is typically jumping and running, but the conditioned response to the CS is a defensive freezing response, or the cessation of all movement except for respiration. Thus, the freezing behavior provides a reliable post-conditioning measure of fear memory in rodents (Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969) . During fear conditioning, the subject learns to associate the tone CS with the foot shock US, and under certain conditions, learns to associate the foot shock with the environment or context where the conditioning session was presented. Acquisition of both the tone-shock and the context-shock associations requires the amygdala; however, the context-shock associations are also dependent upon the hippocampus (Kim and Fanselow, 1992; Phillips and LeDoux, 1992) . There has been considerable debate regarding the involvement of the hippocampus in contextual fear memory since there have been reports that hippocampal lesions impair contextual fear memory (Kim and Fanselow, 1992; Phillips and LeDoux, 1992; Anagnostaras et al., 1999; Stiedl et al., 2000) , and others reporting that such lesions spare contextual fear memory (Cho et al., 1999; Wiltgen et al., 2006) . Consensus seems to be building for the view that if the rodent is permitted sufficient time to acquire a hippocampal-dependent configural representation of the context (the chamber's geometry, olfactory, visual, tactile, and auditory cues) before the US is presented, then the hippocampus is engaged in associating the contextual memory with the foot shock (Rudy et al., 2002 (Rudy et al., , 2004;; Matus-Amat et al., 2004; Zelikowsky et al., 2014) . In a trace fear conditioning procedure, a temporal gap is imposed between the offset of the tone CS and the onset of the foot shock US. The acquisition of an appropriately timed (i.e., anticipatory) conditioned freezing response occurs progressively over the course of the repeated CS-US pairings; this temporal fear memory is a form of declarative memory dependent on intact hippocampal function in rodents and humans (Clark and Squire, 1998; McEchron et al., 1998; Chowdhury et al., 2005) . It should be clear that in deciphering an influence of 5-HT 2A R-sensitive drugs on the distinct processes of memory for contextual and/or cued fear, one must consider the specifics of the conditioning protocol used. Finally, considerable attention has been directed toward defining the mechanisms of fear memory extinction, in part because of extinction's potential relationship to components of the human disorder post-traumatic stress disorder (Jovanovic and Ressler, 2010) . Repeated presentations of the CS alone to the fear-conditioned rodent, promotes the acquisition of a new inhibitory association, which dampens or completely suppresses the expression of conditioned fear responses. Distinct subregions of the rodent PFC contribute differentially to fear extinction; that is, the prelimbic cortex appears to influence the expression of fear responses, while the infralimbic cortex influences the acquisition of extinction of fear memory (Quirk et al., 2010; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011) . Synaptic plasticity within mPFC-BLA neuronal circuits is induced during fear extinction training, resulting in increased inhibition of CS-elicited activity of BLA extinction neurons (Herry et al., 2008 (Herry et al., , 2010)) . Thus, converging evidence implicates the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices of the rodent brain and their differential projections to the amygdala sub-regions and to the hippocampus as contributing significantly to the synaptic plasticity that develops during the acquisition of fear extinction (see Tovote et al., 2015 for a recent review). We found that systemic administration of the 5-HT 2A R agonist TCB-2 (see Figure 2 ) significantly enhanced the acquisition of fear extinction in mice that had undergone trace fear conditioning or delay fear conditioning (Zhang et al., 2013) . Importantly, the 5-HT 2A R agonist did not affect locomotor responses or baseline freezing in the mice. Therefore, the effect of TCB-2 on fear extinction appeared to be specific to facilitating the acquisition of the new inhibitory memory that suppressed fear expression. It is of interest to determine the site of action in the rodent brain at which TCB-2 works to facilitate fear extinction. In light of the plastic changes in neural circuitry that occur during the acquisition of fear extinction, it is possible that TCB-2 influences either the infralimbic cortical neurons or the "extinction neurons" of the BLA to facilitate fear extinction. Izumi and colleagues reported that an amygdala-selective reduction of 5-HT content via site-specific 5,7-DHT injection reduced the expression of conditioned fear responses in rats (Izumi et al., 2012) . While this finding is difficult to reconcile with our report that 5-HT 2A R activation enhanced fear extinction, it is possible that the 5-HT denervation may have increased postsynaptic expression of 5-HT 2A Rs in the amygdala, which might in turn impair the expression of fear. It is clear that further studies are needed to clarify the neurophysiological influences of 5-HT, and the 5-HT 2A R in particular, on the neural circuitry supporting fear memory encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and extinction. The influence of the 5-HT 2A R on the extinction and reconsolidation of fear memory may have significant impact on the development of therapeutic approaches for subjects with fear memory invasion, such as phobias and post trauma stress disorder (Quirk et al., 2010) . For decades, the pharmacological manipulation of the 5-HT system has been a useful approach to treat emotional and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Recent progress has suggested a promising therapeutic application of hallucinogenic 5-HT 2 agonists to treat depression and anxiety (Grob et al., 2011) . These results suggest that despite the historical stigma associated with 5-HT 2A R activators as potential hallucinogens, such compounds may provide important medical potential for treating affective and cognitive symptoms associated with emotional and mental conditions. Glutamatergic neurons in the amygdala, cortex and hippocampus are essential for memory extinction and reconsolidation. Local infusion of NMDAR antagonists into the BLA or CA1 region of hippocampus before extinction training suppresses fear memory extinction and reconsolidation (Baker and Azorlosa, 1996; Szapiro et al., 2003) . The NMDAR partial agonist D-cycloserine facilitates the extinction of fear memory (Walker et al., 2002; Ledgerwood et al., 2003) . Knockout of NMDAR in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells exclusively impairs the establishment of conditioning between the CS and the US during a trace fear conditioning task. These results suggest that the CS representation and conditioning are entrained within hippocampus cell ensembles, probably via NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity (McHugh et al., 1996; Huerta et al., 2000) . Recall that 5-HT 2A Rs are expressed in the dendrites and dendritic spines of dentate gyrus neurons where NMDARs and AMPARs are assumed to be located (Peddie et al., 2008) . 5-HT 2A R activation produces an elevation in the frequency and amplitude of cortical neuronal sEPSP/sEPSCs (Aghajanian and Marek, 1999) , facilitates NMDAR activity and synaptic plasticity in the cortex (Arvanov et al., 1999) and BLA (Chen et al., 2003) . It is worth while to examine the degree to which NMDARs expressed in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices contribute to the 5HT 2A R-mediated enhancement in fear extinction. Converging evidence demonstrates that activation of 5-HT 2A Rs via systemic injection, or by local microinfusion, appears to enhance two forms of hippocampal-dependent memory in mice: object memory and conditioned fear memory. Administration of a selective 5-HT 2A R antagonist alone was not found to significantly affect object memory or fear memory (Zhang et al., 2013) , suggesting that memory consolidation does not require serotonergic activation of 5-HT 2A Rs and/or the antagonists do not affect the tonic effect the 5-HT 2A R. Activation of 5-HT 2A Rs with TCB-2 was also found to facilitate fear memory extinction in mice. These results offer promising support for the view that the 5-HT 2A R may be an important new target for consideration in the search for mechanisms by which long-term memory can be enhanced in humans. Hallucination vs. Spatial Cognition 5-HT 2A R and Hallucination Recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT 2A Rs may promote experiencing visual hallucinations by increasing neuronal excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses (Kometer et al., 2013) . Hallucination is a type of misperception defined as the perception of an object without there being an object to perceive. Hallucinations are a significant characteristic found in a diversity of psychiatric and neurological states. Hallucinations can be triggered by at least three categories of drugs: psychedelics, (i.e., DOI, TCB-2, LSD, and psilocybin) via activation of 5-HT 2A Rs, psychostimulants (i.e., cocaine or amphetamine) via activation of dopamine D2 receptors and dissociative anesthetics (i.e., phencyclidine or ketamine) via blockade of glutamate NMDARs. The signaling and behavioral responses to each hallucinogen are distinct from each other. Activation of 5-HT 2A R is critical for the psilocybin (found in magic mushroom)-induced α oscillations, N170 visual-evoked potentials, and visual hallucinations (Kometer et al., 2013) . 5-hydroxytryptamine/serotonin is an endogenous neurotransmitter and is not considered hallucinogenic. Interesting, N-methyltryptamines, a metabolite of 5-HT, also presents high affinity for 5-HT 2A R and can induce hallucinations in a manner independent of β-arrestin2/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Src/Akt cascade (Schmid and Bohn, 2010) . Signaling for hallucinogens is distinct. Lisuride (an antiparkinsonian agent) and LSD both bind cortical 5-HT 2A R, and thereby regulate PLC activity. LSD signaling involves pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G i/o proteins and Src (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007) . Non-hallucinogenic agonists, for example lisuride, only stimulate cortical Gq in rats, whereas hallucinogens such as psilocybin (found in magic mushrooms), and LSD stimulate both G q/11 and G i (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007) . The β-arrestin pathway is involved in hallucinogen-mediated head shake responses in rodents (Schmid et al., 2008) , and 5-HT induces a head shake response in mice via a β-arrestin-2-dependent signaling. However, the DOI invoked head shake behavior is not dependent upon β-arrestin-2 signaling. These findings suggest that the 5-HT 2A R-β-arrestin interaction may be exclusively for endogenous 5-HT action. Further examination of hallucinogenmediated signaling may have major implications in drug development for treating emotional and mental disorders such as depression and schizophrenia (Schmid et al., 2008) . More research efforts will need to be focused on the hallucinationinducing aspects of 5-HT 2A R-sensitive drugs and, relevant to their potential therapeutic potential, it may be important to consider designing novel compounds that yield more of the beneficial effects, without activating those problematic sensory and perceptual effects. 5-HT 2A R-mediated Hallucination and Spatial Cognition 5-HT 2A receptors may affect spatial cognition. A human population-based study shows that 5-HT 2A R TT genotype of rs6313 is associated with better spatial cognitive performance (Gong et al., 2011) . Kant et al. (1998) reported that the 5-HT 2A R agonist DOI (0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg, 30 min pretreatment) slowed rat performance as assessed by swim time on both a well-learned water maze as well as learning of a new maze, but DOI did not alter error rate on either task. Kant concluded that DOI impaired performance by suppressing motor activity on a water maze (Kant et al., 1998) , which was in opposition to another report showing that manipulation of 5-HT 2A R did not impair the latency to a visible platform water maze test (Naghdi and Harooni, 2005) . The serotonergic hallucinogens may impair the hippocampal-dependent spatial cognition by acting on 5-HT 2A Rs (Naghdi and Harooni, 2005) . However, the direct evidence of 5-HT 2A R on visuospatial cognition and the central target has not been determined. Serotonergic psychedelics may affect the integrity of visual functioning. Visual-directed spatial cognition and navigation are guided by exteroceptive (e.g., landmarks) and interoceptive (e.g., self-motion information) cues, and their integration. The hippocampus is a pivotal brain region receiving and integrating information for spatial memory and navigation in rodents (Broadbent et al., 2004; Eichenbaum, 2004) . The MWM is a classic behavioral task for testing hippocampal-dependent visuospatial cognition, including place learning and memory, orientation and decision-making (Morris et al., 1982; Morris, 1984) . Further, hippocampal place cells exhibit location-specific firing, and are considered to be fundamental components of network for spatial problem solving in the mammalian brain (for a review see Moser et al., 2008) . The hippocampal neural circuit representing current location, directional heading and its integration is influenced by exteroceptive and interoceptive cues, and is considered to guide spatial cognition and navigation. We recently found that pre-test activation of 5-HT 2A R with TCB-2 significantly delayed the initiation of an accurate search path by well-trained male mice in the hidden platform MWM (Zhang et al., 2015) . Importantly, 5-HT 2A R activation did not affect swim performance or visual cue-triggered approach behavior in the visible platform water maze task. Taken together, our results suggest that the activation of 5-HT 2A R impairs the retrieval of hippocampal spatial memory, but not the accuracy of spatial information retrieval and decision-making. It is conceivable that the delayed initiation of accurate spatial search by TCB-2-treated mice might reflect the possible visual hallucinatory influences of the 5-HT 2A R agonist. For example, perhaps TCB-2-induced a brief aberration of visual input that slowed the perception of current position and local view of the mouse at the start of the water maze probe test. Once, reconciled or reoriented, the mouse was able to swim accurately to the remembered spatial location of the platform. It will be of interest to determine where in the brain TCB-2 is acting to alter spatial memory retrieval. The relatively weak influence of TCB-2-induced visual hallucination on spatial navigation may due to the difference in the visual information passing through the brain and central targets processing the information. Taken together, the results we have reported here of memory effects after activation of the 5-HT 2A R represent a fairly complex picture. The post-training administration of TCB-2 enhanced consolidation of object memory in mice. Pre-test administration of TCB-2 did not affect retrieval of object memory, yet delayed retrieval of spatial memory. Pre-extinction training administration of TCB-2 facilitated the acquisition of extinction of both trace and delay fear memories. The facilitating effect of TCB-2 on fear extinction may have been the result of a combined effect of suppressing fear expression -possibly a consequence of impaired retrieval of fear memory, and enhancing the encoding and consolidation of fear extinction. To characterize the 5-HT 2A R agonist as a cognitive enhancer based solely on our object memory results, would be to ignore the other experimental findings. We are interested in conducting a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of TCB-2 on multiple forms of memory. For example, it will be interesting to examine whether postconditioning TCB-2 might enhance the consolidation of fear memory, in a manner consistent with that observed in the NOR task. Likewise, it will be interesting to test whether postextinction training TCB-2 facilitates the consolidation of fear extinction. Results of these experiments will help in better appreciating the modulatory influence of the 5-HT 2A R on longterm memory processes. This synthesis of recent findings of the influences of 5-HT 2A R activation should provide a credible argument that the 5-HT 2A R participates significantly to the well-documented contribution of 5-HT to memory (Meneses, 2013) . 5-HT 2A R and Mental Disorders A number of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders are associated with the variation of structure, expression, and function of 5-HT 2A Rs. Positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging has the sensitivity to quantify binding of 5-HT 2A Rs in CNS disorders. Medication-free depressed subjects presented greater 5-HT 2A R binding (Bhagwagar et al., 2006) . There was a significant reduction in 5-HT 2A R binding in frontal polar, dorsolateral and medial frontal cortex, and parietal and temporal associative cortex of OCD patients and a significant correlation between 5-HT 2A R availability in orbitofrontal and dorsolateral frontal cortex and clinical severity (Perani et al., 2008) . Schizophrenia patients present with very high 5HT 2A R occupancy in the frontal cortex (Talvik-Lotfi et al., 2000) . These results suggest that the variation in the number, affinity and/or function of 5-HT 2A R participates in the etiology of mental disorders. Alzheimer's Disease It is interesting to note that neocortical 5-HT 2A R binding is significantly decreased in patients with early stage AD, and in those with mild cognitive impairment; especially in temporal lobe regions associated with long-term memory (Meltzer et al., 1998; Hasselbalch et al., 2008; Santhosh et al., 2009; Marner et al., 2011 Marner et al., , 2012)) . Further, the severity of cognitive impairment in AD patients correlates with the decrease in 5-HT 2A R binding (Versijpt et al., 2003) . Given the pattern of 5-HT 2A R distribution in neocortical regions and their expression on principal excitatory neurons, it is possible that the marked reduction in 5-HT 2A R in brains of AD is a direct product of neuron loss in key brain regions. Consistent with evidence from the human studies, the Alzheimer's-like neuropathology and associated memory deficits in rodents, which follow intra-hippocampal injection of ß-amyloid(1-42), are associated with a significant reduction in levels of hippocampal 5-HT 2A R expression (Christensen et al., 2008) . Although we have focused this analysis on the influence of 5-HT 2A Rs on long-term, hippocampal-dependent memory, there is clear and compelling evidence to suggest that the 5-HT 2A R represents a potential new target by which human longterm memory may be modulated. We assert that it will be of interest in further examine the contribution of 5-HT 2A Rs to memory processes, and we are particularly interested in determining neurophysiological influences of 5-HT 2A R agonists which promote the enhancement of memory consolidation which we have reported in mice. Drug Memory Drug dependence, classified as an impulsive, compulsive, and relapsing psychiatric disorder, represents a devastating societal problem worldwide. The profound symptoms of drug abuse, in particular the cue-elicited relapse to drug use after even long periods of abstinence, are a consequence of robust experiencedependent synaptic plasticity within the brain's reward circuit. Like episodic, semantic, and habit memory, drug-associated memories are persistent and hold a strong influence on current and future behaviors. Of particular interest is the consideration of memory extinction as a psychological tool for remediating the problem of relapse in drug addicts. That is, if the problem of drug abuse is approached as a mental disorder of memory, then pharmacological manipulations that facilitate extinction may hold therapeutic utility for treating drug abuse. Drug exposure alters the expression and function of 5-HT 2A R, for example morphine decreases frontocortical 5-HT 2A R binding affinity in dogs (Adriaens et al., 2012) . 5-HT 2 Rs are up-regulated in amygdala, midbrain, pons, and medulla of morphine-tolerant and -dependent rats, but not in morphine-abstinent rats (Gulati and Bhargava, 1989) . There is considerable evidence that 5-HT 2A Rs modulate the behavioral consequences of repeated exposure to addictive psychomotor stimulants. For example, M100907 suppresses hyperactivity elicited by cocaine (Fletcher et al., 2002) , MK-801, amphetamine (O'Neill et al., 1999) , and morphine (Auclair et al., 2004) . DOM, a 5-HT 2A R agonist, attenuates locomotor-stimulating effects of morphine, which could be prevented by M100907 (Li et al., 2013) . Furthermore, M100907 attenuated the ability of experimenter-administered cocaine to reinstate lever pressing (Fletcher et al., 2002) and attenuated the drug associated cue-induced reinstatement of cocaineseeking behavior after extinction (Nic Dhonnchadha et al., 2009) . M100907 also suppressed reinstatement induced by nicotine prime or nicotine-associated cue (Fletcher et al., 2012) and sensitization (Zaniewska et al., 2010) . Intra-NAc infusions of M 100907 blocked the expression of cocaineinduced locomotor sensitization (Zayara et al., 2011) . Intra-PFC M100907 decreased cue-elicited reinstatement of cocaine seeking-behavior (Pockros et al., 2011) . Together, these results suggest that 5-HT 2A Rs modulate drug addiction-dependent behaviors such as craving and drug-seeking and pharmacological blockade of 5-HT 2A Rs may represent a therapeutic advance in suppression of cue-evoked craving and/or relapse in drug addicts. Therapeutic Application of 5-HT 2A R Preclinical and clinical studies have provided support for the use of pharmacological manipulation of 5-HT 2A R to treat the symptoms of mental disorders. Activation of 5-HT 2A R with TCB-2 in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex enhances neuronal activity and working memory in hemiparkinsonian rats (Li et al., 2015) . M100907 had no effect on attentional performance, but abolished the PCPinduced attentional performance deficits in rats (Poyurovsky et al., 2003) . M100907 prevents impairment in attentional performance by NMDAR blockade in the rat PFC (Mirjana et al., 2004) . There are a number of 5-HT 2A R drugs that have been evaluated or are being currently evaluated under clinical trials, for example quetiapine 1 for schizophrenia; M100907 2 for depression; ACP-103 3 for Parkinson's disease; pimavanserin for patients with AD psychosis 4 or with Parkinson's disease psychosis 5 . Conclusion In this review, we have summarized recent progress in the signaling, polymerization and allosteric modulation of 5-HT 2A R; and have discussed the critical role of 5-HT 2A Rs in a number of cognitive processes. Based on the results of studies from our lab and others, it appears that activation of 5-HT 2A Rs may offer a novel approach to treat the impairment of learning and memory associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. Meanwhile, blockade of 5-HT 2A R may offer a feasible way to suppress drug craving and/or relapse. It will be very interesting to identify the corresponding signaling pathways by which 5-HT 2A Rs modulate these behavioral capacities. Of particular note, we reviewed evidence that 5-HT 2A Rs may dimerize with other receptors, and that certain pathways may promote constitutive activation of 5-HT 2A Rs, which likely represent novel receptor signaling influences. Connecting such novel properties of 5-HT 2A Rs to distinct functional consequences of 5-HT-, or agonist-, specific activation of the 5-HT 2A Rs will be important for improving understanding the myriad influences of 5-HT 2A Rs in the CNS. The development of highly selective 5-HT 2A R ligands will be essential for further establishing the critical involvement of the 5-HT 2A R for a number of fundamental cognitive behaviors.

Left, during the sample session, mice were allowed to explore two identical novel objects each for at least 15 s, or either one for 18 s within a 10-min sample session. Middle, during the test session 24 h later, one of the objects (a cabinet leveling foot) was replaced with a novel object (a plastic toy monkey) and mice were individually reintroduced to the arena.

(B) Trace fear conditioning training procedure.After a 60-s habitation to Context A, a tone was presented for 15 s followed by 30 s stimulus-free interval, and then a 0.5-s, 0.75 mA foot shock (US) was presented.

TCB-2 significantly decreased percent freezing from the second to eighth CS presentation (Zhang et al., 2013) .

Introduction Serotonin-based hallucinogens, such as the phenethylamine 2,5-dimethoxy-4iodoamphetamine (DOI), the indoleamine psilocin, and ergoline d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) profoundly alter sensory perception, mood, cognition, and behavior in humans. These effects inspired long ago the idea that hallucinogens could be models for understanding mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia (Cohen 1953; Fischer et al. 1951; Hollister 1964) . A common denominator of serotonin-based hallucinogens is their high affinity for serotonin type 2 (5-HT 2 ) receptors (Nichols 2004), including 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors that are expressed densely in regions of the brain known to regulate emotion and memory, such as the frontal cortex and limbic structures (Lopez-Gimenez et al. 1997 , 2001 , 2002) . 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors are altered in psychiatric conditions, ranging from obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression (Benedetti et al. 2008; Millan 2005) to schizophrenia (Herrick-Davis et al. 2000; Kang et al. 2009; Quednow et al. 2009 ). In addition, atypical antipsychotics as well as novel antidepressants and anxiolytic medications target 5-HT 2A and/or 5-HT 2C receptors. Although it is well appreciated that both 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors are altered in psychiatric conditions, whether 5-HT 2A or both 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors mediate the effects of hallucinogens remains to be determined. Several lines of evidence suggest that the behavioral and cognitive effects of hallucinogens are driven primarily through activation of 5-HT 2A receptors in the frontal cortex (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007; Vollenweider et al. 1997; Willins and Meltzer 1997) . The hallucinogenic indoleamine psilocybin causes significant increases in cerebral metabolic rate in the frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (Vollenweider et al. 1997) , and pretreatment with the 5-HT 2A antagonist ketanserin dose-dependently prevents hallucinations caused by psilocybin in humans (Vollenweider et al. 1998) . Also, the 5-HT 2A antagonists MDL100907 and ketanserin block a frontal cortex-mediated hallucinogenic behavioral proxy in rodents, the head-twitch response (HTR; Vickers et al. 2001; Willins and Meltzer 1997) , as well as the increase in synaptic activity in frontal cortex neurons caused by application of the 5-HT 2A/2C agonists α-methyl-5-HT and DOI (Beique et al. 2007; Marek and Aghajanian 1996) . Furthermore, mice devoid of the 5-HT 2A receptor do not exhibit an HTR to DOI (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007) , and 5-HT 2A antagonists attenuate the discriminative properties of several hallucinogens in rodents (Benneyworth et al. 2005; Fiorella et al. 1995b; Schreiber et al. 1994) . Although all known serotonin hallucinogens bind with high affinity and activate with high potency the 5-HT 2C receptor, this receptor has largely been dismissed as a potential modulator of the hallucinogenic response for a number of reasons. Despite similar coupling to G-proteins and second messenger systems as 5-HT 2A receptors, there is evidence that 5-HT 2C receptor activity may oppose activity of the 5-HT 2A receptor. Neurochemically, 5-HT 2C receptors tonically inhibit dopamine release in the frontal cortex, while 5-HT 2A receptor stimulation increases dopamine release in the frontal cortex (Gobert and Millan 1999; Gobert et al. 2000; Millan et al. 1998 ). However, a recent report shows that injections of the 5-HT 2C agonist RO 60-0175 into the medial prefrontal cortex of rats enhance dopamine outflow in nucleus accumbens caused by cocaine administration (Leggio et al. 2009 ). Behaviorally, 5-HT 2A receptor agonism increases, whereas 5-HT 2C agonism decreases locomotor activity, inferred from experiments testing 5-HT 2A/2C receptor agonists in 5-HT 2A knockout mice (Halberstadt et al. 2009 ) and selective 5-HT 2C receptor agonists in 5-HT 2C knockout mice (Fletcher et al. 2009) . Also, systemic injections of selective 5-HT 2C receptor agonists with low efficacy at 5-HT 2A receptors, such as mCPP and MK212, do not cause an HTR in rats. However, when rats are pretreated with the 5-HT 2C receptor antagonist, SB242084, both mCPP and MK212 induce an HTR (Vickers et al. 2001) . Further suggesting that 5-HT 2C receptors are not involved in the behavioral effects of hallucinogens are the observations that the HTR caused by direct injections of DOI into the frontal cortex of rats is blocked by systemic injections of MDL100907, yet not the 5-HT 2C/2B antagonist, SDZ-SER 082 (Willins and Meltzer 1997) . Finally, systemic injections of MK212 and mCPP have been reported to inhibit a DOI-induced HTR in rats (Berendsen and Broekkamp 1990) . However, these latter findings may be confounded by the observations that 5-HT 2C agonists dosedependently decrease locomotor activity, perhaps disguising a role for 5-HT 2C receptors in the DOI-induced HTR. Other findings support the possibility of 5-HT 2C receptor involvement in the hallucinogenic response. For example, direct injections of mCPP and MK212 into the frontal cortex of rats induce an HTR, an effect that is attenuated by systemic pretreatment with the 5-HT 2C antagonist SDZ-SER 082 (Willins and Meltzer 1997) . In addition, enhanced sensitivity to LSD drug discrimination in rats following p-chlorophenylalanine depletion of serotonin is associated with enhanced 5-HT 2C , yet not 5-HT 2A receptor-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) activity (Fiorella et al. 1995a) . Also, although having greater affinity for 5-HT 2A receptors than 5-HT 2C receptors, MDL100907, ketanserin, and other 5-HT 2A "selective" antagonists that block the effects of hallucinogens have appreciable affinity for 5-HT 2C receptors (Knight et al. 2004; Roth et al. 1992) , cautioning interpretation of observations with these drugs as evidence for specific 5-HT 2A receptor dependence. Furthermore, caution should be present when interpreting data using "selective" 5-HT 2C antagonists, such as SB242084, as recent studies show that it has inverse agonist properties at the 5-HT 2C →phospholipase A2→arachidonic acid pathway, yet agonist properties at the 5-HT 2C →PLC→inositol phosphate pathway in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (De Deurwaerdere et al. 2004 ). The second messengers activated by serotonin hallucinogens that are necessary for the hallucinogenic response are still unknown, although it has been shown that DOI-induced head-twitch responses are only partially prevented in Gq knockout mice, suggesting multiple second messenger pathways may be involved (Garcia et al. 2007) . Finally, at least part of the electrophysiological effects of hallucinogens in the frontal cortex is mediated by the 5-HT 2C receptor (Beique et al. 2007 ). In the present study, we use pharmacological evidence, evidence from genetically modified mice lacking the 5-HT 2C receptor, and evidence from a robust and reproducible mouse strain difference in HTR to DOI to show convincingly that 5-HT 2C receptors potently modulate hallucinogen-induced head-twitch. These converging results suggest the possibility that coordinated activity of both 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors underlie the hallucinogenic behavioral response in mice. Methods Mice All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with (1) the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (publication 86-23) and (2) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Eight-week-old male C57BL/ 6J and DBA/2J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and allowed 2 weeks acclimation time in the vivarium prior to testing. Twenty-week-old 5-HT 2C receptor null mice (Tecott et al. 1995) and wild-type littermates on a mixed 129 and C57BL/6 background, as well as 12-16-week-old 129SJ mice, were from established colonies in our laboratory. Mice were housed three to five per cage in standard rodent cages and had unlimited access to rodent chow and fresh water. All experiments involving live mice were performed between 1000 and 1600 hours. Drugs The 5-HT 2A/2C receptor agonist, (±)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI), and the irreversible alkylating agent, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist, MDL100907, was a gift from Merrill-Dow Corp (USA). The 5-HT 2C receptor agonist, MK212, the 5-HT 2C receptor inverse agonist/antagonist, SB206553, and the 5-HT 2C receptor antagonist, SB242084, were each purchased from Tocris (USA). The mixed 5-HT 1/2 receptor antagonist, methysergide, was also purchase from Tocris. [ 3 H]-ketanserin and [ 125 I]-DOI were purchased from Perkin-Elmer (USA). [ 3 H]-mesulergine was purchased from G.E. Healthcare, Inc. Head-twitch response 5-HT 2A receptor hallucinogens induce a quantifiable HTR in rodents that is not induced by the non-hallucinogenic 5-HT 2A receptor agonist lisuride (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007 ). In addition, the HTR is not observed in 5-HT 2A knockout mice administered 5-HT 2A hallucinogens, and in wild-type animals, it is blocked by MDL100907 (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007; Vickers et al. 2001) . Also, 5-HT 2A antagonists block the hallucinogenic response in humans. These data support the HTR as a valid behavioral proxy of hallucinogen action in mice. The role of 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors in DOI-induced HTR was evaluated using both experimental genetic and pharmacologic manipulations. First, 5-HT 2C receptor null mice (N=7) and littermate control mice (N=5) were treated with the hallucinogenic 5-HT 2 receptor agonist DOI (1 mg/kg). Second, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (N=6 per treatment group) were treated with DOI (1 mg/kg) alone or after pretreatment with 5-HT 2A (MDL100987, 0.25 mg/ kg) or 5-HT 2C (SB206553, 0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg; SB242084, 3.0 mg/kg) receptor antagonists 10 min prior to the DOI treatment. To evaluate possible pharmacokinetic effects, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (N=3 per treatment group) were also evaluated for dose-response to DOI at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, and 12.8 mg/kg without any pretreatment. DOI was injected intraperitoneally (IP: inbred strain dose-response and MDL100907 experiments) or subcutaneously (SC: 5-HT 2C null mice and SB206553 and SB242084 experiments) at a volume of 10 ml/kg. An HTR was defined as a clear, rapid, left to right or right to left tic movement of the head of the mouse following DOI treatment. Ten minutes after DOI injection, mice were placed inside a clean 3-L transparent glass beaker with a thin layer of fresh rodent bedding at the bottom. At least two observers counted HTRs in a 10-min period-observer's scores were averaged before analysis. Analyses of the data were by t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA; Stata, v.11) . EEDQ blockade of 5-HT 2A receptor binding sites To test whether SB206553 blocks 5-HT 2A receptors in addition to 5-HT 2C receptors in vivo, SB206553 was examined for its ability to prevent EEDQ binding to 5-HT 2A receptors. EEDQ is an alkylating agent that binds irreversibly to 5-HT 2A receptor binding sites (Kettle et al. 1999) , blocking binding of [ 3 H]-ketanserin to 5-HT 2A receptors in membrane preparations. Mice were injected SC with saline (N=6), SB206553 (3 mg/kg, 10 ml/kg, N= 4), or MDL100907 (0.25 mg/kg, 10 ml/kg, N=4) 30 min prior to EEDQ injections (10 mg/kg, 10 ml/ kg). Twenty-four hours later, mice were killed, and frontal cortex brain tissue was processed for [ 3 H]-ketanserin radioligand binding (as described above). Ten-micromolar SB206553 was added to the radioligand assay buffer to block [ 3 H]-ketanserin binding to 5-HT 2C receptor sites. A single concentration of [ 3 H]-ketanserin (5 nM) was used, and nonspecific binding was determined with the addition of 100 μM methysergide. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Data were transformed to assess 5-HT 2A receptor specific binding in drug-treated animals as percent of 5-HT 2A receptor specific binding in saline-treated animals. A one-way ANOVA was performed to compare groups. Saturation binding 5-HT 2A receptor binding site density (Bmax) and antagonist affinity (Kd) were determined with [ 3 H]-ketanserin, comparing membranes from frontal cortex of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Adult male C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice were killed by brief isoflurane anesthesia and decapitation. Brains were quickly dissected free of the head, and olfactory bulbs were removed. The brain was placed into a cold, clean brain matrice, and frontal cortex, defined as cortex 2-3 mm caudal to the anterior pole of the brain, was cut free coronally using a clean razor blade. The tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 50-mM Tris assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.3)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in assay buffer. The centrifugation step was repeated two more times. Finally, the supernatant was discarded, the pellet was resuspended in assay buffer, briefly homogenized, and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Membrane preparations (200 μg/tube) were incubated with a range of concentrations of [ 3 H]ketanserin (0.25-8 nM) for 60 min at 37°C to determine total binding. Nonspecific binding was determined with 100 μM methy-sergide. All experiments were performed in duplicate. Following incubation, free radioligand was separated from bound by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/C glass filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Filters were placed in vials with scintillation cocktail and counted 12 h later in a liquid scintillation counter. Whole brain minus cerebellum was used for analysis of 5-HT 2C receptor binding site density. Brain tissue was homogenized in cold assay buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatant was decanted, pellet was re-homogenized in fresh, cold assay buffer, then spun again at 20,000 g; this step was repeated, then samples were incubated for 30 min at 37°C to remove endogenous ligand. A final spin was performed, and the pellet was re-homogenized in ice-cold assay buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 90 min with increasing concentrations of [ 3 H]-mesulergine for 5-HT 2C receptor binding (0.077-22.1 nM). One hundred nanomolar spiperone was added to block 5-HT 2A receptor sites, and nonspecific binding was determined with the addition of 100 μM methysergide. All experiments were performed in duplicate. The reaction was terminated by adding ice-cold assay buffer, and membranes were collected, using a Brandel harvester, on Whatman GF/B glass filters presoaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed three times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Filters containing membrane-bound radioligand were placed in 5 mL scintillation fluid (Aquasol-2, Perkin-Elmer, USA), vortexed vigorously, and allowed to set overnight in the dark at room temperature. Bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonlinear regression analysis (Stata, v.11, and Graphpad 5.02, USA) was used to determine Bmax and Kd estimates by simultaneously fitting the total and nonspecific curve data for six independent experiments per strain. The Bmax and Kd estimates for the C57BL/6J and DBA/ 2J samples were then compared by t test. 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptor autoradiography Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane anesthesia then decapitated. Brains were removed and frozen quickly in isopentane on dry ice, then dabbed dry with a Kim Wipe and stored at -80°C until sectioning. Brains were thawed to -20°C inside a Cryostat chamber. Twentymicrometer sections were thaw-mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides, then stored again at -80°C . At the start of the autoradiography experiments, slides were brought to room temperature then washed twice, 10 min each at room temperature in assay buffer containing 100 nM SB269770 to block 5-HT7 receptors. Slides were transferred to slide boxes containing assay buffer with 0.14 nM [ 125 I]-DOI. Additional slides were incubated in radioligand plus 100 nM spiperone to define 5-HT 2C receptors or 30 μM methysergide to define nonspecific binding. Slides were incubated for 60 min at room temperature then washed thrice, 10 min in ice-cold assay buffer, and briefly washed in cold deionized water, prior to drying with a stream of dehumidified air. Slides were exposed to Biomax MR film for 24, 48, or 72 h prior to developing. Autoradiograms were digitized using a CanoScan 4400F scanner (Canon, USA). Regional analysis of 5-HT 2A or 5-HT 2C receptor binding was quantified using NIH ImageJ version 1.42q (Abramoff et al. 2004 ). Brain areas, including anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, anterior striatum, and posterior striatum, were outlined based on a mouse brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson 2004) . Average pixel density was determined and converted to microcuries per gram protein using 14C standards (ARC, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). Data from six C57BL/6J male mice were compared with data from six DBA/2J male mice using two-tailed unpaired t tests. Western blots of Gα q/11 and Gα i / o subunits To examine whether levels of G-proteins that couple to 5-HT 2 receptors relate to the strain differences in the DOI-induced HTR, Western blots for Gα q/11 and Gα i/o in the frontal cortex were performed. C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (N=12, eight for each strain for Gα q/11 and Gα i/o , respectively) were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. Brains were removed quickly and sectioned in a chilled brain block. Cortex tissue was placed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer, containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na 2 EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton-X, 1 mM freshly prepared PMSF, and Roche Complete® protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Tissue was homogenized using a Kontes pellet pestle motor and pestle then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. Supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80°C until Western blot procedures. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method. Twenty micrograms of protein was run on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes overnight. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk with 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS, then incubated with Gα q/11 (rabbit, 1 to 500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) or Gα i/o/t/z/gust (rabbit, 1 to 500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), and α-tubulin (mouse, 1 to 7500, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) primary antibodies for 90 min. Membranes were then incubated in 4% non-fat dry milk with 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS, then with horseradish peroxidase labeled donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1 to 100,000 dilution, G.E. Healthcare, USA) and sheep anti-mouse (1 to 100,000 dilution, G.E. Healthcare, USA) for 90 min, followed by several washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20. Protein was visualized using chemiluminescence and exposure of membranes to film. Film was scanned onto a PC, and densitometry analyses were performed using ImageJ software (Abramoff et al. 2004 ). Serotonin-induced PLC activity A comparison of basal and 5-HT-stimulated PLC activity was made in ex vivo cortex membrane preparations from six young adult male C57BL/6J mice and six young adult male DBA/2J mice. Frontal cortex was homogenized in 20 volumes of 25 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EGTA ("homogenization buffer"). Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Buffer was decanted. Membranes were resuspended in 20 volumes of homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, four additional times. Membranes were then resuspended in 25 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, containing 3 mM EGTA, 10 mM LiCl, and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the membrane pellet(s) were stored at -80°C. On the day of the assay, pellets were thawed, and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. The assay protocol was based on methods previously described (Damjanoska et al. 2004; Wolf and Schutz 1997) . One hundred micrograms of membrane protein was diluted on ice into 100 μl of total volume with a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES-Tris pH 7.4, 3 mM EGTA, 10 mM LiCl, 12 mM MgCl 2 , 1.44 mM sodium deoxycholate, 200 nM Ca 2+ , 1 μM GTPγS, 3 μM 5-HT, and 1 mM unlabeled phosphatidyl inositol. 5-HT was not included for basal measures. After addition of 100 μM [ 3 H]-phosphatidyl inositol, the reaction tubes were incubated in a 37°C water bath for 20 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.9 ml 1:2 chloroform:methanol mixture, followed by 0.3 ml chloroform and 0.3 ml 0.25 M HCl, and 2 min of vigorous shaking. Tubes were then centrifuged at 8,000 g for 2 min. Of the upper aqueous phase, 0.3 ml was mixed with 6 ml scintillation cocktail and counted 1 h later on a liquid scintillation counter. PLC activity for each biological sample (mouse) was measured in triplicate under basal and 5-HT-stimulated conditions. Triplicates were averaged by mouse before analysis. The comparison of basal and 5-HT-stimulated PLC activity was made between strains by use of an ANOVA model that included one within mouse factor (basal versus stimulated), a factor to account for correlated measures by mouse (mouse), one between mouse factor (C57BL/6J versus DBA/2J), and an interaction between stimulation and strain factors. Of interest in this ANOVA is the interaction that tests whether PLC activity differs between strains. DOI-induced Egr1 and Egr2 gene expression Early growth response 1 (Egr1) and 2 (Egr2), two gene markers induced by hallucinogenic 5-HT 2A receptor agonists (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007 ), were measured to test for potential differences in DOI-induced cellular signaling in frontal cortex of DBA/2J and C57BL/6J. Egr1 and Egr2 RNA transcript relative abundance was compared by realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) between saline (0.9%)-and DOI (3 mg/kg, IP route)-treated young adult male C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (N=5 mice per condition). Tissue was collected 45 min after injection. Frontal cortex was placed immediately into RNAlater and stored until RNA isolation. The tissue was homogenized in TRI Reagent (Sigma), chloroform was mixed with the lysate, and the mixture was separated into three phases by centrifugation. The RNA was then precipitated from the aqueous phase with isopropanol. DNA-free DNase treatment and removal reagents (Ambion) were used to remove contaminating genomic DNA. RNA quality control and assessment was checked by measuring the 260/280 absorption ratio in 10 mM Tris using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. In addition, an RNA integrity number (RIN) using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was determined. All 20 samples used for real-time PCR were high quality, intact RNA, without significant protein or DNA contamination. FAM-labeled Taqman probes for relative quantification of Egr1 (assay ID Mm00656724 m1) and Egr2 (assay ID Mm00456650 m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems, along with two control gene probes (mouse ACTB and mouse GAPD). The real-time PCR assay was run by the Vanderbilt Microarray Shared Resource core facility (http://array.mc.vanderbilt.edu/services/realtime.vmsr) using the ABI 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system. All samples were run in quadruplicate, and cycle times were calculated using ABI SDS software. Cycle times and sample identifier data for target and control genes were exported from ABI SDS software to a tab-delimited text file. Data were imported to Stata (v.11) for statistical analyses. Because there is no justification for paired comparisons between individual C57BL/ 6J mice and DBA/2J mice, the 2ˆ(-ΔΔ Ct) method cannot be used (Schmittgen and Livak 2008) . Instead, statistical comparisons are made on 2ˆ(-Δ Ct) data, for example, on 2ˆ(-(CtEgr1-CtGapdh)) (Schmittgen and Livak 2008) . Analysis of the target genes was by comparison to Gapdh, because it did not appear to be regulated by DOI as did Actb. Target genes were tested jointly by multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for an interaction between strain and DOI treatment, because both Egr1 and Egr2 are reportedly downstream readouts of DOI-induced 5-HT 2A receptor activation (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007) . Results DOI induces a 5-HT 2A receptor-dependent head-twitch response that is modulated by the 5-HT 2C receptor As shown in Fig. 1 , 5-HT 2C knockout mice exhibited a significantly lower number of HTR in 10 min relative to their wild-type littermates (t test, p=0.01; mean ± SEM number of HTR: WT (N=5), 25±3; 5-HT 2C knockout (N=7), 14±3). To assess head-twitch dose-response to DOI, HTRs were counted in three C57BL/6J and three DBA/2J mice for each of eight DOI dose levels (48 total mice): 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, and 12.8 mg/kg (Fig. 2a ). Group means (with ±1 SEM error bars) are shown for each strain in Fig. 2a . A 2×8 factorial ANOVA produced a significant interaction between strain and dose level (F(7,32)=4.93, p<0.01). Bonferroni corrected simple main effects (SME) analysis resolved the interaction into strain differences at DOI doses of 0.4 mg/kg and above (*p<0.05 as indicated in Fig. 2a ), but not at either 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg. Both strains appear to reach maxima in HTR between 0.8 and 1.6 mg/kg DOI dose and maintain this response at higher doses. A small decrement in DBA/2J response was noticed at the higher doses and was accompanied by apparent reduction of overall activity during the observation period. When these data are fit by a four-parameter logistic (dose-response) equation, including parameters for top, bottom, ED50, and Hill slope, only the strain difference in the maximum was significant (t=7.57, p<0.001, C57BL/6J top=38 head-twitches, DBA/2J top=64 head-twitches, model fit not shown). The dose-response profiles suggest a robust strain difference in DOI-induced HTR that is not readily explained by pharmacokinetic or metabolic factors presenting as a left-right shift in the ED50 but similar maxima. The role of 5-HT 2A receptors in the HTR to DOI was assessed using the antagonist MDL100907. When MDL100907 was given as a pretreatment (0.25 mg/kg) 10 min prior to 1 mg/kg DOI, the DOI-induced HTR was completely blocked in both strains (C57BL/6J=0(0) (mean (SEM)), N=6; DBA/2J=1.25(0.54), n=6; 10 min observation; data not shown). Neither C57BL/6J nor DBA/2J mice head-twitch following only saline injection (C57BL/6J=2.3 (0.44), N=6; DBA/2J=0.75(0.36), N=6; 10 min observation; data not shown). The role of 5-HT 2C receptors in the HTR to DOI was assessed using the inverse agonist/ antagonist SB206553 and the antagonist SB242084. Figure 2b shows head-twitches after saline pretreatment, 3 mg/kg SB206553 pretreatment, or 3 mg/kg SB242084 pretreatment prior to a 1-mg/kg DOI treatment in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (N=6 per group). SB206553 was also used at a pretreatment dose of 0.3 mg/kg, and it produced similar results to 3 mg/kg (data not shown). As expected from the non-parallel lines in Fig. 2b , a 2×3 factorial ANOVA produced a significant interaction between strain and pretreatment (F (2,30)=10.41, p<0.01). Bonferroni corrected SME analysis resolved the interaction into a significant strain difference after saline pretreatment (F(1,30)=48.34, p<0.01), but not after SB206553 pretreatment (F(1,30)=3.94, p=NS), nor after SB242084 pretreatment (F(1,30)=0.82, p=NS). Alternatively, Bonferroni corrected SME analysis describes differences within each strain between saline and either antagonist pretreatments as significantly different (p<0.05), but that head-twitch between antagonist pretreatments do not differ (p=NS). Finally, the difference in HTR between C57BL/ 6J and DBA/2J mice after saline pretreatment is significantly different than the difference between strains after either SB206553 pretreatment (F(1,30)=18.30, p<0.01) or SB242084 pretreatment (F(1,30)=12.34, p<0.01), indicated by the stars in Fig. 2b . We conclude that DOIinduced head-twitch in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice is reduced but not eliminated by 5-HT 2C antagonist pretreatment. Furthermore, we conclude that the strain difference in headtwitch is eradicated by 5-HT 2C antagonist pretreatment. Reduction in DOI-induced head-twitch response by pretreatment with SB206553 is not mediated by 5-HT 2A receptors Figure 3 shows the results of an EEDQ inactivation study, a classic pharmacological demonstration of drug specificity. One-way ANOVA analysis revealed a significant main effect of drug treatment on 5-HT 2A specific binding (F(2,13)=13.09, p<0.01). Pretreatment of mice (N=6) with EEDQ significantly reduced [ 3 H]-ketanserin binding to 5-HT 2A sites after 24 h, eliminating 65% of specific binding. Pretreatment with 0.25 mg/kg MDL100907 (N=4) 30 min prior to EEDQ significantly prevented EEDQ inactivation of 5-HT 2A receptors (p<0.05), restoring 5-HT 2A specific [ 3 H]-ketanserin binding to 90% of controls. In contrast, pretreatment with 3.0 mg/kg SB206553 (N=4) 30 min prior to EEDQ treatment did not alter the ability of EEDQ to reduce 5-HT 2A specific [ 3 H]-ketanserin binding, suggesting that this dose of SB206553 does not appreciably bind 5-HT 2A receptor binding sites in the mouse brain in vivo. Candidate mechanisms explaining the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J difference in head-twitch 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptor saturation binding and autoradiography-Saturation binding was used to test for differences in 5-HT 2A receptor density in the frontal cortex and 5-HT 2C receptor density in whole brains, from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine the Bmax and Kd estimates from total binding and nonspecific binding data for each sample (Table 1 ). Comparisons of the 5-HT 2A Bmax values (femtomoles per milligram protein) between strains (t test, t=0.54, df=10, p=NS) and of the 5-HT 2A Kd values (nanomolar) between strains (t test, t=0.06, df=10, p=NS) showed no significant differences. Comparisons of the 5-HT 2C Bmax values between strains (t test, t=0.21, df=10, p=NS) and of the 5-HT 2C Kd values between strains (t test, t=1.34, df=10, p=NS) also showed no significant differences. [ 125 I]-DOI autoradiography for cortical and striatal brain areas in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J did not reveal obvious differences in either 5-HT 2A or 5-HT 2C receptor high-affinity binding (Fig. 4a , b, respectively). Kruskal-Wallis tests of prefrontal cortex and two other cortical regions, as well as two striatal regions, were not significant (p>0.05). Western blot for Gα q/11 or Gα i/o -No evidence could be established to support a difference in levels of Gα q/11 or Gα i/o in frontal cortex between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Because α-tubulin appeared to be regulated between strains (data not shown; however, see Fig. 5 inset for an example), we compared raw density measures for Gα q/11 and Gα i/o between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Frontal cortex from 12 mice of each strain was used for Gα q/11 Western blots, and frontal cortex from eight mice of each strain was used for Gα i/o Western blots. Unpaired t tests comparing mean protein densities in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice showed no significant differences between groups (Gα q/11 , p=0.94; Gα i/o , p=NS). PLC activity-Serotonin-stimulated PLC activity was measured by the amount of [ 3 H]inositol phosphate produced by PLC in the membrane fractions of C57BL/6J (N=6 mice) and DBA/2J (N=6 mice) frontal cortex. Figure 6 shows PLC activity measures for basal and 5-HTstimulated conditions by mouse and strain. A strain difference in PLC activity would be evident as a difference in the slope from basal to stimulated conditions. While ANOVA confirms significant 5-HT-stimulated PLC activity across strains (F(1,10)= 63.89, p<0.01), showing that 5-HT stimulated PLC activity, the interaction between strain and PLC activity was not significant (F(1,10)=0.40, p=NS). There is no evidence for differing PLC activity in frontal cortex between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. PLC activity induced by 5-HT 2A receptors does not likely underlie DOI-induced head-twitch differences between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. DOI-induced Egr1 and Egr2 gene expression- The relative RNA transcript abundance of Egr1 and Egr2 genes in the frontal cortex of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice after saline and DOI (3 mg/kg) injections was measured using real-time PCR and analyzed by the comparative CT method (n=5 mice per group). Figure 7 shows in panels (a) and (b) the delta cycle times for Egr1 and Egr2 relative to Gapdh. A MANOVA predicting Egr1 and Egr2 expression from strain and DOI treatment confirmed the strain (F(2,15)=17.39, p<0.01) and DOI (F(2,15) =20.18, p< 0.01) effects apparent in panels (a) and (b). The interaction between strain and DOI was not significant (F(2,15)=0.10, p=NS). Egr1 and Egr2 expression in the frontal cortex of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice are increased equivalently by DOI, independent of a basal strain difference in gene expression. Discussion 5-HT type 2 receptors are central mechanistic components of the psychoactive response to serotonin-based hallucinogenic drugs, and it is accepted that the 5-HT 2A receptor subtype is the most essential receptor mediating the hallucinatory effects (Nichols 2004; Winter 2009) . In humans, antagonists of 5-HT 2A receptors such as chlorpromazine dampen the psychoactive effects of hallucinogens (Freedman 1986) , and pretreatment in humans with the 5-HT 2A antagonist ketanserin dose-dependently prevents the hallucinogenic effects caused by psilocybin ingestion (Vollenweider et al. 1998 ). In addition, mice devoid of the 5-HT 2A receptor do not exhibit a regularly observed behavioral response to hallucinogens, the HTR (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007 ). Fairly selective 5-HT 2A antagonists, such as MDL100907, also prevent this response, and block drug discrimination of DOI and the related hallucinogenic analogue, DOB (Benneyworth et al. 2005; Schreiber et al. 1994 ). However, several findings confound the interpretation that the psychoactive response to serotonin-like hallucinogens is mediated solely by the 5-HT 2A receptor. Results from radioligand binding studies show that the 5-HT 2A receptor antagonists ketanserin, chlorpromazine, and MDL100907 have appreciable affinity for 5-HT 2C receptors (PDSP, http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/). In addition, all known 5-HT 2 receptor agonists that are hallucinogenic have equal or greater affinities and potencies at 5-HT 2C receptors relative to 5-HT 2A receptors. These data leave open the possibility that 5-HT 2C receptors functionally participate in inducing the hallucinogenic response (Fiorella et al. 1995a; Winter 2009) . Despite speculation that activation of the 5-HT 2C receptor could modulate the psychoactive effects caused by hallucinogens, the collective results of drug discrimination studies suggest that 5-HT 2C receptors are not central to the subjective effects of serotonin-like hallucinogens (Winter 2009) . 5-HT 2C receptor antagonists do not block drug discrimination for DOI in mice (Schreiber et al. 1994; Smith et al. 2003) . We have also observed previously that 3.0 mg/kg of the 5-HT 2C inverse agonist/antagonist SB206553 does not reduce the ability of mice to discriminate LSD from vehicle (data not shown). Hence, we were surprised to observe a blunted DOI-induced HTR in 5-HT 2C knockout mice, our initial hint that 5-HT 2C receptors may be involved in this response elicited by hallucinogens. The reduced HTR to DOI in 5-HT 2C knockout mice was likely not due to developmental alterations in 5-HT 2A receptor levels, as it has been shown that 5-HT 2C knockout mice have equivalent levels of 5-HT 2A receptors as their wild-type littermates (Lopez-Gimenez et al. 2002) . Similarly, 5-HT 2A knockout mice do not have alterations in 5-HT 2C levels (Weisstaub et al. 2006) , suggesting that genetically manipulating either 5-HT 2C or 5-HT 2A receptors does not alter expression of the other. In a separate set of experiments, we observed that DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice have dramatically different HTRs to DOI with DBA/2J mice showing 75% more head-twitches. This difference was likely not due to pharmacokinetic or metabolic factors, as it was maintained across a wide range of doses. The HTR was completely eliminated by pretreat-ing either strain of mouse with MDL100907, suggesting it is 5-HT 2A mediated. However, several measures aimed at discovering a difference between the strains in 5-HT 2A receptor function in the frontal cortex, including receptor and G-protein density, Egr1 and Egr2 expression, and PLC activity, proved futile. Collectively, these data suggested that the 5-HT 2A receptor was not mediating the strain differences in response to DOI. We next tested whether the 5-HT 2C receptor mediated the strain differences. The 5-HT 2C selective inverse agonist and antagonist SB206553 completely eliminated the strain differences in response to DOI at two doses, 3.0 mg/kg and a tenfold lower dose, 0.3 mg/kg. This effect was not due to non-selective blockade of 5-HT 2A receptors, as pretreatment of mice with 3.0 mg/kg SB206553 did not prevent EEDQ inactivation of 5-HT 2A receptors. Recent reports show that SB206553 is a positive allosteric modulator of nicotinic α7 receptors (Dunlop et al. 2009) , which called into question whether other targets of SB206553 could be mediating its effects on the DOI HTR. However, a different 5-HT 2C antagonist, SB242084, also attenuated DOI HTR and eliminated the strain differences; these data conflict with a previous report using rats (Vickers et al. 2001) , suggesting there may be species-related differences in mechanisms controlling the DOI-induced HTR in rodents. The observation that at high concentrations SB242084 activates 5-HT 2C receptor→PLC signaling in CHO cells may also be pertinent to species differences in the effects of SB242084 (De Deurwaerdere et al. 2004) . In summary, our data showing suppressive effects of 5-HT 2C receptor antagonists on DOI-induced HTR in mice combined with the attenuated response to DOI in 5-HT 2C knockout mice strongly support the conclusion that the 5-HT 2C receptor potently modulates the behavioral response in mice induced by the hallucinogenic 5-HT 2 agonist DOI. We attempted to discover a difference in 5-HT 2C density or cellular function in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice but were unsuccessful. [ 3 H]-mesulergine saturation binding did not reveal a difference in total 5-HT 2C density in brains of the two strains. Also, [ 125 I]-DOI autoradiography which preferentially labels high-affinity agonist sites did not reveal a significant difference between the strains in 5-HT 2C binding sites in regions thought to underlie the DOI-induced HTR. A forward genetic screen of DOI-induced HTR in experimental crosses of mice derived from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J may point to the genetic loci that underlie the strain difference. Speculative possibilities that may underlie the different HTR induced by DOI in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice include alterations in glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and/or 5-HT1A receptors or the serotonin transporter, which have been shown to modulate the stimulus properties and head-twitch-inducing properties of hallucinogens in rodents (Jennings et al. 2008; Krall et al. 2008; Winter 2009) . The role of the 5-HT 2C receptor in modulating the behavioral response to DOI in mice is interesting in light of observations that the 5-HT 2A receptor agonist, lisuride, does not have LSD-like hallucinatory effects in humans (Freedman and Boggan 1982; Herrmann et al. 1977) and does not cause an HTR in mice (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007 ), an observation confirmed in our laboratory (data not shown). These findings have been interpreted to support the idea that 5-HT 2A receptor agonists with hallucinogenic properties stabilize a unique conformation of the 5-HT 2A receptor that is not induced by non-hallucinogenic 5-HT 2A agonists, suggesting that serotonin-based hallucinogens are conformationally selective ligands, activating specific signaling pathways downstream of the 5-HT 2A receptor (Gonzalez-Maeso and Sealfon 2009; Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007 ). An alternative or additional possibility is that lisuride differentially interacts with 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors. In cultured cells of the rat choroid plexus, lisuride behaves as an antagonist at 5-HT 2C receptors, whereas the hallucinogens LSD, DOB, DOM, and 5-methoxy-DMT are potent 5-HT 2C agonists (Burris et al. 1991; Sanders-Bush and Breeding 1991) . This is in contrast to in vitro studies using 5-HT 2C -VSV receptors stably expressed at high levels in CHO cells, where lisuride behaves as a weak partial agonist (Cussac et al. 2002) or agonist (Cussac et al. 2008 ). The differences in 5-HT 2C receptor expression levels and edited isoforms between native cells from the choroid plexus and CHO cells transfected with 5-HT 2C -VSV (Burns et al. 1997; Cussac et al. 2008; Sanders-Bush and Breeding 1991) could account for this discrepancy; alterations in 5-HT 2C receptor levels and RNA editing of 5-HT 2C receptor can alter ligand pharmacology at 5-HT 2C receptors (Berg et al. 2008; Fitzgerald et al. 1999) . Also, weak partial agonist activity in vitro may translate to antagonism in vivo. The inability of lisuride to induce LSD-like hallucinations may relate to its antagonism of 5-HT 2C receptors expressed in vivo. Taken together, the converging evidence suggests that the behavioral response in mice elicited by the hallucinogen DOI is potently modulated by 5-HT 2C receptors. 5-HT 2C receptor knockout male mice (N=7) exhibit significantly fewer head-twitch responses compared to littermate control mice (N=5) after 1 mg/kg DOI treatment a C57BL/6J and DBA/2J male mice exhibit a robust difference in head-twitch response to DOI (N=3 mice per dose level per strain). Dose-response profiles show a significant difference in maxima between strains. DBA/2J has approximately 1.5-to twofold greater head-twitch response than C57BL/6J. A 2×8 factorial analysis of variance reveals a significant strain by dose interaction that is resolved into differences between strains at dose levels of 0.4 mg/kg or higher, as indicated by stars. b DOI-induced head-twitch in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice is reduced but not eliminated by 5-HT 2C antagonist pretreatment, and the strain difference in head-twitch is eradicated by 5-HT 2C antagonist pretreatment (N=6 per group). The stars indicate both a significant reduction in head-twitch response after SB206553 or SB242084 pretreatment compared to saline pretreatment, and significant reduction in the difference between strains after 5-HT 2C antagonist pretreatment compared to saline (see text for details) EEDQ treatment inactivates 5-HT 2A receptor binding (N=6) in the mouse brain which is prevented by pretreatment with MDL100907 (0.25 mg/kg, N=4), but not SB206553 (3.0 mg/ kg, N=4), suggesting that 3.0 mg/kg SB206553 does not bind to 5-HT 2A receptor binding sites at this dose or lower doses  There were no detectable differences in densities of Gα q/11 and Gα i/o proteins in cortex of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. Inset shows a representative photomicrograph of Western blots of frontal cortex from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice showing equivalent levels of Gα q/11 and Gα i/o proteins Fig. 6 .

Introduction The term ''spatial attention'' designates interrelated sensory, motor, and cognitive processes that collectively enable the selective allocation of neural resources to motivationally relevant parts of the environment. A key aspect of this process is the compilation of a salience map that combines the spatial coordinates of an event with its perceptual and motivational relevance (Fecteau and Munoz 2006; Gottlieb 2007) . How the human brain integrates information from sensory, motor, cognitive, and motivational domains to dynamically guide spatial attention is not fully understood. Spatial attention is supported by a large-scale network consisting of interacting cortical components in posterior parietal cortex (PPC), including intraparietal sulcus (IPS), lateral frontal cortex, including the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the cingulate gyrus, including its posterior segment (PC) (Mesulam 1981; Corbetta et al. 1993; Nobre et al. 1997; Gitelman et al. 1999; Kim et al. 1999; Mesulam 2000) . It is likely that these components support spatial attention by mediating dynamic interactions between spatial orienting and more abstract cognitive functions such as motivational and emotional evaluation. This possibility has been examined via a few singleunit recording studies in nonhuman primates (Platt and Glimcher 1999; Coe et al. 2002; Sugrue et al. 2004 ), but remains to be examined in humans. Motivational encoding of stimuli is mediated by subcortical, limbic, and paralimbic structures, including the amygdala (LaBar et al. 2001; O'Doherty et al. 2002; Gottfried et al. 2003) , orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Rolls et al. 1981; Tremblay and Schultz 1999; Small et al. 2001) , and ascending monoaminergic pathways arising from the substantia nigra (SN) and nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) (Foote et al. 1980; Aston-Jones et al. 1997; Schultz et al. 1997) . Effective motivational modulation of spatial attention most likely depends on accurate real-time assessment of motivational salience mediated via these regions. However, the involvement of limbic and monoaminergic areas in the encoding of motivational salience of cues that predict locations of relevant attentional targets is relatively understudied. The present study was designed to explore the motivational modulation of the spatial attention network in a task that manipulated the motivational properties of the attentional target, the motivational state of the participant and the location of the target. To that end, we used a covert attentional shift paradigm to examine the effect of alterations in motivational states (hunger and satiety) on attentional biasing to peripheral locations where motivationally relevant (food) and irrelevant (tools) targets were expected to appear. We expected participants to respond faster to food-related targets when hungry than when full and that this effect would not be present for tools. We hypothesized that hunger would selectively increase neural responses in limbic regions and pontomesencephalic monoaminergic nuclei to food-but not tool-related directional cues. Finally, we examined the possibility that components of the spatial attention network, including PPC and posterior cingulate cortex would mediate motivational modulation of anticipatory spatial attention in a materialspecific manner reflecting the current motivational value of the attentional target rather than the nonspecific effects of arousal. Materials and Methods Participants Nine right-handed volunteers (4 women; mean/SD age = 27/5.25 years) participated in the study. Participants were screened for a history of psychiatric and neurologic illness or contraindications for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and gave written informed consent prior to participation. Participants were also screened to ensure that they liked the food stimuli, that is, donuts and danishes and were not restrictive eaters or diabetics. The study was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. Two participants were excluded due to fMRI related artifacts resulting in a final N of 7. Procedure Participants were asked to perform a modification of the task developed by Posner for examining covert shifts of spatial attention (Posner 1980) while undergoing fMRI in hungry and satiated states which were counterbalanced across participants. While performing the task, participants were asked to fixate on a central diamond (1°wide) that remained on the screen for the complete duration of the task. They were instructed to respond to the onset of peripherally presented donuts or hex-nuts (targets) and danishes or screws (foils) by pressing a button (Fig. 1 ). To ensure that participants attended to the stimuli, they were instructed to press the left-hand button for foils and the right-hand button for target images. All food and tool stimuli were obtained from commercially available images, and were formatted to the same resolution and size. Each trial began with a darkening of one side or the entire central diamond, which provided an alerting directional or nondirectional cue respectively (Fig. 1 ). This cue remained on the screen until the appearance of the target stimulus to avoid engaging working memory. Three different lengths of delay (or stimulus asynchrony, SOA of 200, 400, and 800 ms) between cue and target presentation were employed to maximize attentional demands and prevent temporal predictability. Following this delay, targets or foils appeared in 1 of 2 peripheral squares (on the right and left of the diamond, each 1.5°wide) centered at 7.5°from the central diamond for 100 ms, on the side indicated by the directional cue (valid trial), on the opposite side (invalid trial), and on either side of the nondirectional cues (nondirectional trial). The total intertrial interval varied as a function of SOA such that each trial totaled 2200 ms (i.e., 2000, 1800, and 1600 ms) . Null events or time periods when the screen remained blank, were interspersed with target events to allow deconvolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) (Burock et al. 1998) . Null events lasted 1000 ms and up to 3 could occur consecutively. Half of the trials in each run were comprised of null events. Each participant was imaged as they performed the task in 2 experimental sessions, once while hungry and once while satiated on donuts. The 2 experimental sessions were held 1 week apart and their order was counterbalanced across subjects. All participants were instructed not to eat food for at least 8 h prior to the fMRI session. Ratings of hunger and appetitiveness of all target stimuli were obtained prior to each experimental session. To manipulate the motivational salience of the food stimuli, subjects were informed that they would be given 1 donut following testing in the hunger condition and were allowed to consume as many donuts as they could before testing in the satiated condition. In the scanner, the participants viewed the task via a mirror attached to the head coil. Using a liquid crystal display projector attached to the stimulus presentation computer, stimuli were back-projected onto translucent screen that the participants viewed through a mirror. Participants performed a total of 6 randomly presented runs in each experimental session. Within each run, the task was implemented as a mixed event-related design by presenting the food and tool trials in separate blocks. This was done in order to avoid introducing the additional factor of deciding whether the stimuli were foods or tools. An image saying ''FOOD'' or ''TOOLS'' appeared at the beginning of each block for 1000 ms to cue subjects on the block type. Each run consisted of 6 randomly presented blocks, 3 food blocks and 3 tool blocks. Overall, each experimental run consisted of 216 trials (90% targets and 10% foils) out of which, 60% were valid trials, 15% were invalid trials, and 25% were nondirectional trials. Image Acquisition Functional images were acquired with a 3-Tesla Siemens Trio wholebody MRI system using a birdcage head coil. Participants lay supine within the scanner. Their heads were immobilized with a vacuum pillow (Vac-Fix, Bionix, Toledo, OH) and the restraint calipers built into the head coil. A vitamin E capsule was taped to the left temporal region to mark laterality for image processing. Participants were given 2 nonmagnetic button boxes, which enabled recording of their reaction time (RT) data. In each of the 6 runs/session, 227 images were acquired using echoplanar T 2 -weighted sequence (time repetition = 2.1 s, time echo = 20 ms; flip angle 90°, field of view = 220 cm, matrix = 64 3 64 voxels). Each image consisted of 40 contiguous axial slices (slice thickness 3 mm, inplane resolution 3 3 3 mm) acquired parallel to the anterior and posterior commissures. Six dummy images were collected at the beginning of each functional run to allow the blood oxygen--dependent (BOLD) signal to reach a steady state and were excluded from further processing and analysis. After the fMRI acquisition, a 160-slice magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo structural sequence was acquired (spatial resolution 1 3 1 3 1 mm) in each session and was used to register the participant's functional data into standard space. Data Analyses Behavioral Analyses Trials with RTs less than 100 ms or greater than 1000 ms were discarded. Mean RT was calculated for valid, invalid, and nondirectional trials separately for hungry and satiated experimental sessions. An overall repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 3 factors, motivational state (hungry and full), target type (food and tools), and directional nature of cue (valid, invalid and nondirectional) was performed to evaluate the impact of alterations in hunger and satiety on the RT for validly, invalidly, and nondirectionally cued food and tool targets. To compute the degree to which a valid directional cue benefited performance, a cue benefit score was calculated using equation (1). RTN -RTV i r RTN ð1Þ RTN is the mean RT for the nondirectional trials, RTV i is the RT for each validly cued trial, and r RTN is the standard deviation of the nondirectional trials. The cue benefit scores were calculated separately for the hungry and satiated sessions using the mean and standard deviation nondirectional RT for that particular session. The cue benefit scores, which are measures of the speed of attentional shifts to the food or tool-related targets, were used to predict variations in the HRF during the validly cued trials. Image Processing and Analyses fMRI data were analyzed using the SPM2 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) running under the MATLAB environment (Mathworks, Inc., Sherborn, MA). Functional images for each participant were corrected for slice timing, realigned for correction of motion artifacts, coregistered to that participant's high-resolution anatomical T 1 image, spatially normalized, using the EPI template provided in SPM2, into a standard anatomical space ) that approximately conforms to the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux (1988) and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full width half maximum = 7 mm). Runs with more than 1 voxel of scan-to-scan movement were excluded from further analysis. For each subject, a canonical HRF approximating the temporal course of the BOLD HRF to valid, invalid, and nondirectionally cued food and tool targets was modeled separately for the hungry and satiated sessions. The temporal derivative of the HRF was included to accommodate temporal variability in the HRF function across brain areas and participants. This model yielded a per-voxel parameter estimate (b) map representing the magnitude of activation associated with each trial type. Null trials were not modeled explicitly and contributed to the implicit baseline. The design also included a 128 sec high-pass filter and an AR(1) model to account for temporal nonsphericity due to autocorrelations. The fMRI data were first examined to determine brain regions that are involved in encoding motivational salience (level 1). These regions were expected to show selective sensitivity to food-related cues when hungry but not when satiated, an effect that would not generalize to tools. For each subject, statistical comparisons between different trial types were conducted by comparing the corresponding b maps using linear contrasts. To contrast activation for food versus tool targets in the hungry versus satiated state, corresponding b maps from validly cued trials were subjected to a double subtraction procedure resulting in a [(hungry food -full food) -(hungry tools -full tools)] statistical parameter (SPM) t map for each subject. This procedure is statistically equivalent to motivational state by target type, within-subject interaction. Finally, the [(hungry food -full food) -(hungry tools -full tools)] linear contrast images computed at the individual subject level were forwarded to a second-level random-effects analysis to examine the effect of motivational state (hungry and full) on neural responses to directional cues indicating food-and tool-related targets. Next, we examined brain regions that mediate motivational modulation of anticipatory spatial attention in a material-specific manner (level 2). For this purpose, another model was estimated to examine brain areas whose activity was associated significantly with cue benefit scores. This model was identical to the one outlined above except for the addition of a condition specific regressor that modeled the benefit scores derived from the cues as a continuous factor. This regressor allowed us to identify voxels that specifically show a significant correlation with cue benefit scores on validly cued trials. The calculation of the cue benefit scores is described in the behavioral analyses section above. To examine how motivational state altered the correlation between neural activity and the speed of attentional shifts differentially to food versus tool targets we subjected the b maps denoting correlation between cue benefit scores and brain activity for validly cued trials to the double subtraction procedure outlined above. This double subtraction procedure resulted in a [(hungry food -full food) -(hungry tools -full tools)] SPM t map for each subject. These maps were forwarded to a second-level random-effects analysis to examine the effect of motivational state (hungry and full) on the correlation between cue benefit scores and neural responses to directional cues indicating food-and tool-related targets. Because we had specific a priori hypotheses regarding the role of limbic regions (e.g., amygdala and PC) in encoding of motivational valence (level 1) and the role of spatial attention network (e.g., PC, PPC/IPS, FEF) in biasing spatial attention (level 2), we conducted a region of interest (ROI) analyses. Search volumes for the ROI analyses were restricted within a 6--10 mm radius of coordinates for amygdala (±21, -3, -27), PC (±21, -39, 36; ±9, -39, 24), PPC/IPS (±21, --60, 51; ±27, -60, 57), FEF (±27, -6, 42; ±51, 0, 36), medial OFC (MOFC) (±18, 25, -18), and lateral OFC (LOFC) (±41, 34, -19) that were derived from earlier studies conducted in our labs, from contrasts most relevant to the present study (Gitelman et al. 1999; LaBar et al. 2001; Small et al. 2001 Small et al. , 2003 Small et al. , 2005)) . For these ROIs small volume correction was applied to P-values and only regions that were activated above a P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected threshold are reported. In addition, to examine regions other than those identified by the ROI analyses, we conducted an exploratory whole-brain analyses by using a statistical threshold of P < 0.005, uncorrected and a cluster threshold of greater than 6 voxels. Finally, the pattern of activation in regions identified as being above threshold in the ROI and whole-brain analyses outlined above was examined in greater detail. This was done by extracting signal time courses and calculating the spatially averaged percent signal change or parameter estimate for each condition from each activation cluster using the Marsbar toolbox (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/). SPSS was then used to examine the simple effects driving the interaction confirmed by whole-brain and ROI analyses. Finally, we examined the task-dependent changes in connectivity that linked the 2 levels using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. The PC, which has been shown to be involved in anticipatory biasing of spatial attention to motivationally relevant events (Small et al. 2003 (Small et al. , 2005)) , served as a seed region from the first level. For PPI, the deconvolved time-series data for PC was extracted from each participants normalized data, based on a sphere of radius 6 mm around the peak activation voxel from the group analyses. The product of this activation time-series data and the psychological vector of interest (hungry food -full food) resulted in the PPI term. New SPMs with the physiological variable (PC activity), psychological variable, and their interaction as regressors were computed for each subject. These subject level PPI SPMs were then entered into a random-effects group analyses using a t-test within functional parietal and OFC ROIs where motivational state differentially altered the relationship between neural activity and speed of attentional shifts toward food compared with toolrelated targets and results were thresholded at P < 0.05 (uncorrected) with a cluster size of >6 contiguous voxels. Results Motivational modulation of spatial attention was examined by asking participants (in the fasting or satiated state) to perform an event-related fMRI task in which central cues signaled locations of motivationally relevant (food) and motivationally irrelevant (tool) attentional targets that were presented peripherally. Thus, the present study implemented a motivational state (hungry and full) by attentional target type (food and tools) factorial design. One aim was to reveal areas that were selectively responsive to motivationally relevant targets. The second aim was to examine whether regions of the spatial attention network mediate motivational modulation of anticipatory spatial attention in a material-specific manner. Behavioral Behavioral ratings of hunger level showed that participants rated themselves as significantly more hungry prior to performing the task in the hungry condition compared with the satiated condition (Fig. 2A ; t 6 = 10.07, P < 0.05). Participants also rated food stimuli as less appetizing when fed than when hungry, whereas this effect did not generalize to the tools (Fig. 2B ). A repeated-measures ANOVA with motivational state and target type as factors showed a significant interaction (F 1,6 = 31.11, Figure 1 . Stimuli and timelines used in the experimental task. Participants were instructed to respond to the onset of peripherally presented targets (donuts or hex-nuts) and foils (danishes or screws) by pressing the right and left button respectively. A cue that preceded target onset by 200, 400, or 800 ms indicated that the target would appear on the side indicated by the directional cue (valid trial), on the opposite side (invalid trial), and on either side of the nondirectional cues (nondirectional trial). Each participant was imaged as they performed the task in 2 experimental sessions, once while hungry and once while satiated on donuts. P = 0.001) and a main effect of target type (F 1,6 = 31.11, P = 0.001). Simple-effects tests showed that food stimuli were rated as more appetizing during the hungry than the satiated condition (P < 0.05) whereas appetitiveness ratings for tools remained unaffected by motivational status. A 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA with motivational state, target type, and cue type (valid, invalid, and nondirectional) as factors showed a significant main effect of the cue type (F 2,5 = 6.32, P = 0.043). Planned comparisons showed a faster mean RT for validly cued than invalid and nondirectional trials and a faster mean RT for nondirectional than invalidly cued trials (F 1,6 = 15.18, P = 0.008) indicating that we were able to effectively modulate spatial biasing of attention. Because the present study proposed specific hypotheses regarding selective enhancement of attentional biasing toward motivationally relevant targets, we used a 1-tailed, paired t-test to examine whether participants showed faster RT for food-related targets that were motivationally relevant. Results showed a trend toward significance with marginally faster mean RT's to validly cued food-related targets when hungry than when full (t 6 = -1.59, P = 0.083). This effect did not generalize to validly cued tool targets or nondirectionally cued food-and tool-related targets, indicating that it reflects a relatively specific effect of hunger-related motivation on spatial attention directed to edible objects. Functional MRI Encoding of Motivational Salience (Level 1) The first aim of the present study was to reveal areas that are selectively responsive to the motivational value of targets. For this purpose, a random-effects analysis was used to examine the effect of motivational state (hungry and full) on neural responses to directional cues indicating food-and tool-related targets (Methods). ROI analyses showed a motivational state by target type interaction in a priori defined ROIs in the PC and amygdala (Fig. 3A , Table 1 ). The pattern of percent signal change in both ROIs indicated that the interaction was driven primarily by hunger-related increases in neural responses to food-but not tool-related cues (Fig. 3B ). Repeated-measures ANOVAs on the mean percent signal change extracted from these ROIs confirmed the motivation state by target type interaction in the PC (F 1,6 = 5.58, P = 0.056) and the amygdala (F 1,5 = 17.83, P = 0.008). Simple-effects tests examining the interaction in both ROIs showed that activity for tool-related cues when hungry did not differ from tool-related cues when full and food-related cues when hungry (all Ps were nonsignificant). In both PC and amygdala, the interaction was driven by increased activity for cues indicating food-related targets when hungry than when full (Ps < 0.05). In addition, the amygdala showed significant difference between food and toolrelated cue activity in the satiated condition (P < 0.05). Analyses of the whole brain showed a motivational state by target type interaction in parahippocampal gyrus, peristriate cortex, and in areas of the pontomesencephalic brainstem region consistent with the location of the LC and SN (Fig. 3A , Table 1 ). The representative pattern of percent signal change in these clusters indicates that the interaction was driven by hunger-related increases in neural responses to food-but not tool-related cues (Fig. 3B ). A repeated-measures ANOVA on the percent signal change confirmed a motivational state by target type interaction in parahippocampal gyrus (F 1,6 = 22.52, P = 0.003), peristrate cortex (F 1,6 = 5.60, P = 0.056), SN (F 1,6 = 38.78, P = 0.001), and LC (F 1,6 = 19.90, P = 0.004), indicating that these regions responded differentially to food-and toolrelated cues based on motivational state. Simple-effects tests showed greater activity for food-related cues when hungry than food-related cues when full and tool-related cues when hungry (all Ps < 0.05). Simple effects comparing tool-related cue activity when full to tool-related activity when hungry and food-related activity when full were nonsignificant. Thus, the interactions were primarily driven by changes in food-related cue activity for hungry and satiated condition. Although the spatial resolution provided by fMRI does not allow for a precise identification of smaller structures such as brainstem nuclei, the locations of the activations in the present study are compatible with locations reported for LC and SN in earlier imaging studies (O'Doherty et al. 2002; Wittmann et al. 2005; Sterpenich et al. 2006; Germain et al. 2007; Murray et al. 2007) . Motivational Modulation of Spatial Attention (Level 2) Next we examined whether regions of the spatial attention network mediate motivational modulation of anticipatory spatial attention in a material-specific manner. We identified brain areas where motivational state altered the correlation between neural activity and speed of attentional shifts toward food versus tool-related targets differentially (Methods). ROI analyses using a priori ROIs identified in spatial attention experiments conducted in our lab show a motivation state by target type interaction in IPS/PPC and PC (Fig. 4A , Table 1 ). The pattern of mean parameter estimates extracted from these regions indicates a stronger positive correlation between brain activity and benefits derived from cues signaling food-related targets when hungry versus food targets when full, whereas an inverse pattern is present for tool-related targets (Fig. 4B ). This interaction was confirmed by repeated-measures ANOVA conducted on mean parameter estimates extracted from IPS/ PPC (F 1,5 = 20.22, P = 0.006) and PC (F 1,5 = 6.92, P = 0.046). Simple-effects tests confirmed a stronger positive relationship between brain activity and cue benefits when expecting foodrelated targets in the hungry condition versus food targets in the full condition and tool-related targets in the hungry condition (P < 0.05), whereas an opposite pattern seen for tools was marginally significant (P < 0.08). We also conducted ROI analyses with MOFC and LOFC coordinates because OFC subdivisions have been shown to be differentially recruited based on the reward value of a food item. Results showed a motivation state by target type interaction in the MOFC and LOFC (Fig. 4C , Table 1 ). Further examination revealed a differential pattern of results in the 2 OFC subdivisions with increased MOFC activity associated with greater cue benefits for food-related targets while hungry and increased LOFC activity associated with less cue benefits while hungry and greater cue benefits for food-related targets while full (Fig. 4D ). Finally, whole-brain analyses showed an interaction in PPC/ IPS (upper axial sections in Fig. 4A ), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and parahippocampal gyrus (lower axial section in Fig. 4A , Table 1 ). A repeated-measures ANOVA on the parameter estimates confirmed the motivational state by target item interaction in the TPJ (F 1,5 = 29.50, P = 0.003) and parahippocampal gyrus (F 1,5 = 6.92, P = 0.046), indicating that these regions were differentially involved in spatial attention based on motivational state. Simple-effects tests confirmed a stronger positive relationship between brain activity and cue benefits when expecting food-related targets in the hungry condition versus food targets in the full condition and tool-related targets in the hungry condition, whereas an opposite pattern was seen for tool-related targets (P < 0.05). We also examined PC's role as a putative neural link between motivation and spatial attention using PPI analysis (Friston et al. 1997) . This analysis allowed us to examine context-specific changes in functional integration between PC and IPS or OFC during spatial biasing of attention toward motivationally relevant compared with irrelevant targets. PPI analysis was conducted using functional ROIs where motivational state differentially altered the correlation between neural activity and speed of attentional shifts toward food compared with tool-related targets (Methods). Results revealed a cluster of voxels in the IPS ROI that showed motivational state specific increments in functional integration with PC such that functional coupling between IPS and PC for food-related stimuli increased when the stimuli were motivationally relevant (hungry state) versus when they were irrelevant (full state). Thus, the functional coupling between PC and IPS increased during spatial biasing of attention to motivationally relevant stimuli compared with irrelevant stimuli. Although a similar pattern of results was seen for the functional coupling between OFC and PC, the findings were marginally significant (P < 0.08). Summary of Results Subjects rated themselves hungrier and the donuts as more appetizing after the fast; hunger caused a shortening of RT to foods but not tools; the SN, LC, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and peristriate cortex were more strongly activated by foods than tools when hungry but not when full; activation in components of the spatial attention network such as the PPC, banks of the IPS, TPJ, and PC was more positively correlated with the speed of attentional shifts to food targets when hungry than full, whereas an inverse pattern was seen for tool targets; stronger functional coupling between PC and IPS during spatial biasing of attention toward motivationally relevant stimuli; in the OFC positive correlations of neural activity with attentional shifts to foods were seen medially (MOFC) when hungry and laterally (LOFC) when full. correlations of neural activity with attentional shifts to foods were seen medially (MOFC) when hungry and laterally (LOFC) when full. Discussion Earlier studies have used secondary reinforcers like money to demonstrate the influence of motivational variables on attention (Small et al. 2003 (Small et al. , 2005;; Della Libera and Chelazzi 2006; Engelmann and Pessoa 2007) . The present study manipulated the motivational state of the participants and used targets with intrinsic hedonic relevance to examine the neural mechanisms involved in the motivational guidance of spatial attention. In this study, fasting or satiated participants performed an eventrelated fMRI task in which spatially uninformative or directional cues signaled locations of motivationally relevant (food) and motivationally irrelevant (tool) attentional targets. The trials were blocked into ''food'' and ''tool'' sessions in order to maintain a consistent set of motivational expectation. The foils ensured that subjects attended to the targets, whereas the invalid and spatially uninformative cues allowed us to quantify the effectiveness of cue-induced attentional shifts and differentiate them from the effects of temporal expectancy. We examined the influence of motivational state (hungry vs. satiated) and cues depicting targets (food vs. tools) on neural activity in order to explore how attentional shifts are modulated by motivational factors. Although we modeled neural activity for predictive cues, it is to be noted that the present experimental design does not allow clear separation of cue from target-related activity. Limbic and Monoaminergic Encoding of Motivational Valence Hunger selectively enhanced activity in visual peristriate cortex, limbic structures (amygdala, PC, parahippocampal gyrus), and brainstem monoaminergic nuclei (SN, LC) to foodbut not tool-related directional cues. Recordings in monkeys (Nishijo et al. 1988; Ono et al. 2000) , amygdala lesion studies in rats (Dwyer and Killcross 2006) and humans (Bechara et al. 1995 (Bechara et al. , 1999)) , and fMRI studies in neurologically intact subjects (LaBar et al. 2001; O'Doherty et al. 2002; Gottfried et al. 2003) have demonstrated the importance of amygdala in mediating the motivational and visceral impact of motivationally relevant events. Similarly, noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways have been known to regulate motivational and arousal aspects of behavior (Foote et al. 1980; Berridge 1996; Aston-Jones et al. 1997; Schultz et al. 1997 ). Our study further establishes their sensitivity to predictive cues that trigger an anticipatory attentional shift toward locations where motivationally relevant events are expected to occur. Through its interconnections with peristriate areas (Aggleton 1993), the amygdala could provide a top-down modulatory influence that preferentially enhances the encoding of salient events in visual areas (Fig. 3A ). Although it is unlikely that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the monoaminergic pathways and specific cognitive domains, the activation of these modulatory pathways provides a general mechanism for augmenting neural responses to salient events. The combined activation of these 2 pathways in anticipation of the food picture would be expected to enhance the hunger-induced salience of the motivationally relevant stimulus and therefore make it a more effective target for attentional shifts. Motivational Modulation of Attentional Network How do neurons sensitive to motivational valence influence the deployment of spatial attention? To address this question, we looked for those areas where hunger altered the correlation between neural activity and speed of attentional shifts differentially to foods versus tools. We found that in the parietal components of the spatial attention network (banks of IPS and TPJ and in the PC), activity was more positively correlated with the speed of attentional shifts to food targets when hungry than when full, whereas an opposite pattern was seen for tool targets. The banks of the IPS may participate in the guidance of spatial attention by compiling a ''salience map'' (Gottlieb 2007; Molenberghs et al. 2007 ). An important requirement for the compilation of a saliency map is sensitivity to the motivational relevance of extrapersonal stimuli, a property that has been demonstrated for lateral intraparietal (LIP) neurons of the IPS in nonhuman primates. In monkeys placed in a foraging environment where reward values of alternative spatial targets changed, LIP neurons represented the probability that a particular region of space would serve as the endpoint of the next saccade (Sugrue et al. 2004 ). When animals were allowed to choose freely between alternative responses, LIP neuronal activation was correlated with the reward that the animal could expect from each response (Platt and Glimcher 1999; Coe et al. 2002) . Our results show that the human IPS region may have similar response contingencies. Analyses in Figures 3 and 4 indicate that IPS neurons do not mediate a general encoding of motivational valence but that they are sensitive to motivational relevance specifically when it guides spatial attention. These findings support the role of IPS in integrating information from multiple domains, including motivational and spatial, in forming topographical saliency representations that guide spatial attention. Another posterior parietal area with a similar response pattern was located in TPJ, a region frequently activated by spatial attention tasks and implicated in the reorientation of attentional focus (Nobre et al. 1997; Gitelman et al. 1999; Corbetta and Shulman 2002) . The present study provides evidence that the involvement of TPJ in spatial attention is modulated by motivational variables. In the present study, we also found a negative correlation between IPS/PC/TPJ activity and attentional biasing toward motivationally irrelevant (tools when hungry) and devalued (food when full) targets. This finding is consistent with another study that showed TPJ deactivation for a stream of distractors, a finding that is proposed to reflect attentional filtering of irrelevant inputs (Shulman et al. 2007 ). Another somewhat unexpected finding was that of positive correlation between neural activity in spatial attention regions and speed of attentional shifts to tool targets when satiated, a relationship that may be attributable to the relative preference for tool-related targets in contrast to devalued (and perhaps aversive) food targets in the satiated state. These patterns may be indicative of attentional modulation aimed at enhancing the impact of motivationally relevant stimuli and diminishing the impact of motivationally less relevant stimuli (Fenske 2006 ) in a dynamic fashion that is sensitive to real-time changes of context. Present results also demonstrate that the OFC plays an important role in motivational guidance of spatial attention. MOFC and LOFC subdivisions show functional (Elliott et al. 2000; O'Doherty et al. 2001; Small et al. 2001 ) and anatomical (Morecraft et al. 1992 ) heterogeneity. MOFC is involved in processing reward value whereas LOFC is involved in processing aversive information or in suppression of previously rewarding responses (O'Doherty et al. 2001; Small et al. 2001) . Our results show that MOFC activity correlates positively with attentional shifts toward motivationally relevant targets and negatively with shifts toward devalued targets. Conversely, LOFC activity correlates positively with attentional shifts toward devalued targets and negatively with motivationally relevant targets. These findings extend functional differences in medial and lateral OFC to its role in motivational guidance of spatial attention. Due to strong connectivity with PC, it is likely that the OFC provides an encoding of motivational salience that is relayed to the spatial attention network through the PC. The Posterior Cingulate Cortex: Crossroads of Motivation and Spatial Attention The primate cingulate gyrus is interconnected with the amygdala, parahippocampal region, insula, OFC, and inferior parietal lobule (Mesulam et al. 1977; Pandya et al. 1981; Morecraft et al. 1992; Morris et al. 2000) . Furthermore, PC shows involvement in the generation of visuospatial biases to cues predicting attentional targets (Hopfinger et al. 2000; Small et al. 2003) . Hence, the PC is ideally suited to serve as a neural interface between motivation, as encoded by the limbic system, and spatial attention. We have previously found that neural activity in the PC correlates positively with anticipatory shifts of spatial attention and that this relationship is strengthened by the presence of monetary incentives (Small et al. 2003 (Small et al. , 2005)) , indicating that the PC is involved in anticipatory biasing of spatial attention to motivationally relevant events. However, in these studies the target had no intrinsic hedonic relevance and became motivationally relevant only through introduction of monetary incentives. Furthermore, motivational state (desire to earn money) remained constant and the reward was postponed until the end of the session when the subject received the earnings based on performance. The present experiment involved a more naturalistic setting where targets had ecologically relevant hedonic valence and the corresponding biological motivation could be manipulated to alter the appetitiveness of the targets. The PC neurons in our study responded differently than IPS and TPJ neurons, displaying sensitivity to the general motivational valence of an upcoming stimulus (Table 1 , Fig. 3 ) and also mediating the motivational guidance of spatial attention shifts (Table 1 , Fig. 4 ). These findings are consistent with monkey single-cell recording studies showing that PC neurons signal expected and actual reward outcomes associated with shifts of gaze (McCoy et al. 2003) as well as subjective preferences that guide visual orienting (McCoy and Platt 2005) . Furthermore, the parahippocampal gyrus, a region that is strongly interconnected with PC (Pandya et al. 1981 ), shows a similar pattern of results as the PC (Table 1 ) which is consistent with the proposed role of PC--parahippocampal connections in visuospatial biasing (Vogt et al. 1992) . Finally, the proposed role of PC as a neural interface between motivation and spatial attention was supported by findings of increased functional coupling between PC and IPS during spatial biasing toward motivationally relevant but not irrelevant attentional targets. Hence, a possible mechanism through which the posterior cingulate directs attention may involve modulation of saliency representations in the PPC such that salient locations in extrapersonal space become the preferential targets of limited attentional resources. Effective motivational modulation of spatial attention depends on accurate real-time assessment of motivational salience. The results of the present investigation reveal conjoint limbic and monoaminergic encoding of fluctuations in motivational salience of cues predicting attentional targets. Furthermore, attentional network components such as IPS and PC show greater involvement in spatial biasing toward motivationally relevant targets and less involvement in biasing toward motivationally irrelevant targets. OFC subdivisions are differentially involved in motivational guidance of spatial attention showing positive correlations of neural activity with attentional shifts to foods medially (MOFC) when hungry and laterally (LOFC) when full. Finally, PC appears to play a pivotal role in integrating the limbic encoding of valence with the sensorimotor aspects of spatial attention, a process that is essential for directing spatial attention selectively to motivationally relevant targets in an environment where the position of targets and their relevance can undergo rapid changes.

Introduction The spiking activity of cortical neurons is often characterized by their average response over a large number of trials, prompting a wealth of theoretical studies relating the structure of neuronal networks to their trial averaged firing rate dynamics 1 . However, trial averages do not capture the stochastic and irregular dynamics characteristic of cortical populations and the nervous system in general 2 . Indeed, trial-to-trial fluctuations are central to contemporary theories of cortical computation 3, 4 . A deep mechanistic understanding of neuronal variability remains an open challenge. Early theoretical studies deduced that variable spiking activity could arise through a balancing of strong, yet opposing, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs 5, 6 . Expanding on this conjecture, van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky 7 showed that networks of recurrently coupled model neurons robustly create a state where strong excitation is approximately balanced by inhibition, creating a push-pull dynamic that generates irregular spiking activity. More recently, balanced networks have been implicated in theories of optimal coding 8 , working memory 9 , and stimulus tuning 10 . Numerous experimental studies have established that excitation is often approximately balanced by inhibition in cortical circuits 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 . In sum, balanced networks provide a parsimonious model of the irregular spiking activity observed in cortical circuits. Early balanced network models produced asynchronous activity through sparse connectivity 7, 18 . However, several experimental studies reveal that local cortical networks are densely connected, with connection probabilities between nearby neurons sometimes exceeding 40 percent 19, 20, 21, 22 . These data imply substantial overlap between local synaptic inputs, which could, in principle, synchronize cortical networks. However -counter to intuition -balanced networks with dense connectivity show weak spike train correlations 23 . This "asynchronous state" results from the correlated excitatory (e) or inhibitory (i) afferents to neuron pairs being actively cancelled by a strong negative e-i correlation establishing weak correlations even when connectivity is not sparse 23 . Consistent with the predicted asynchronous state, some multi-unit extracellular recordings show noise correlations that are nearly zero on average 24 . However, a majority of population recordings in cortex reveal comparatively large correlations 25, 26 . Several studies suggest that the magnitude of noise correlations is dependent on many factors 27 , including arousal 28 , attention 29 , anesthetic state 23,24,30,31 and cortical layer 32,33 . Finally, while in vivo whole cell recordings reveal strong positive e-e and i-i correlations coexisting with strong e-i correlations 13 , these correlation sources do not always perfectly cancel as predicted by some theoretical models 28 . Taken together, these studies show that cortical circuits can exhibit both weak and moderate noise correlations, at odds with predictions from the current theory of balanced networks 23 . In this study, we generalize the theory of correlations in densely connected balanced networks to include the widely observed dependence of synaptic connection probability on distance 34, 21 . We show that spatially broad recurrent projections disrupt the asynchronous state, producing a signature spatial correlation structure: Nearby pairs of neurons are positively correlated on average, pairs at intermediate distances are negatively correlated and distant pairs are weakly correlated. These positive and negative correlations cancel so that the average correlation between pairs sampled randomly over a large range of distances is nearly zero. We uncover this non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance in recordings from superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex, but only after correcting for a latent source of shared fluctuations. Our findings decouple balanced excitation and inhibition from asynchronous network activity, greatly extending the applicability of balanced network theory to explain cortical dynamics. Results We consider a network of excitatory and inhibitory exponential integrate-and-fire model neurons. Neurons provide recurrent, lateral synaptic input to one another and receive feedforward synaptic input from a non-local presynaptic population. A detailed mathematical analysis of correlations in the limit of large network size is provided in Supplementary Note S.1 and Supplementary Figures 1 2 3 . Below, we provide an outline of these theoretical results and confirm their predictions using computer simulations. We first use a simplified network model to demonstrate how the asynchronous state considered in previous theoretical work 23 is broken by heterogeneous input correlations 35 . We then consider a more realistic model where neurons belong to a continuous spatial domain and connection probability depends on distance. Homogeneous input correlations are cancelled by balanced networks To demonstrate the mechanisms affecting correlations in recurrent networks, we first simulated a simplified network of N=20,000 neurons (half excitatory and half inhibitory) that all receive the same fluctuating feedforward input and are each connected with probability 0.25 (Figure 1a ). Despite the fact that neuron pairs share all of their feedforward input and 25% of their recurrent synaptic input on average, spiking activity was asynchronous, with an average pairwise spike count correlation of 6.8×10 -5 (Figure 1b, c ). This small average correlation is a defining characteristic of the asynchronous state. Mathematically, this state is realized when spike count covariances in the network satisfy 23 where C SS denotes the average spike count covariance between pairs of neurons in the recurrent network, N is the number of neurons in the network and O(1/N) denotes asymptotic proportionality to 1/N for large N. Note that covariance and correlation scale identically with network size in balanced networks, so we discuss them interchangeably 23 . Our theoretical analysis proceeds by noting that spike count covariance is inherited from synaptic input covariance 26 and therefore the two scale similarly with N in the asynchronous state, where C II denotes the average covariance between neurons' synaptic inputs. Synaptic inputs can be decomposed into their feedforward and recurrent sources, I=F+R, so that neurons' input covariances decompose as where C FF is the average covariance between neurons' feedforward input currents, C RR between their recurrent inputs and C RF between one neuron's recurrent and the other neuron's feedforward synaptic input. Recurrent synaptic input, R, is composed of positive contributions from lateral excitatory synaptic inputs and negative contributions from inhibitory (R=e-i). Shared input fluctuations are visualized by averaging the inputs to several neurons, so that the unshared contributions average out (Figure 1d ). Overlapping inputs cause C FF and C RR to be positive (Figure 1d -the blue and red curves have large fluctuations). If feedforward input correlation is moderate, C FF ~O(1), then recurrent input tracks the feedforward input so that C RF is negative and nearly perfectly cancels the positive sources of correlations (i.e., 2C RF =-(C FF +C RR )+O(1/N); see Supplementary Note S.1). As a result, the covariance between the total synaptic inputs is weak, C II ~O(1/N), (Figure 1d -the black curve has small fluctuations). This cancellation arises naturally in the balanced state and does not require a precise tuning of model parameters 23 . Since spiking correlations are inherited from synaptic input covariance 26 , this cancellation of input covariances leads to small, O(1/N), spike count correlations. Heterogeneous input correlations can disrupt the asynchronous state To study the impact of heterogeneity on correlations in balanced networks, we modified the above model by dividing the neurons into two populations. Each population received a separate feedforward input (Figure 1e ). The two feedforward input sources were statistically identical but uncorrelated. Recurrent connectivity was not changed: Neurons were randomly connected without respect to population membership (identical to Figure 1a ). This input heterogeneity dramatically changed the structure of correlations in the network. Pairs of neurons in the same population had strongly positive spike count correlations on average (0.34), while neuron pairs from opposite populations were negatively correlated with a nearly identical correlation magnitude (-0.34), and the average correlation between all pairs was nearly zero (4.2×10 -4 ; Figure 1f, g ). The mechanism responsible for this change in correlations can be understood by again separating the synaptic input covariance into its recurrent and feedforward sources, but generalizing the decomposition to account for neuron "distance" to obtain (1)   Here, C II (d) is the average covariance between input currents to pairs of neurons separated by distance d where d=0 for neurons in the same population and d=1 for opposite population pairs, and similarly for the other terms. Feedforward input is only correlated between neurons in the same population, so C FF (0)>0, but C FF (1)=0. In contrast, recurrent connections do not respect population membership and thus neither do the statistics of recurrent input, Since covariances C RR (d) and C RF (d) do not depend on d, but C FF (d) does, cancellation cannot be achieved in Eq. ( 1 ) for both d=1 and d=0 simultaneously. In other words, the one "copy" of shared recurrent synaptic input cannot cancel both versions of the feedforward synaptic inputs. The loss of cancellation causes the total synaptic current shared by neurons in the same population to inherit shared fluctuations from their feedforward inputs (Figure 1h ; compare blue and black), giving rise to positive O(1) correlations between samepopulation pairs. A competitive dynamic introduces negative correlations between neurons in opposite populations (Figure 1f ,g). A similar mechanism was considered in a recent theoretical study 35 . For illustrative purposes, we considered a simplified network model with discrete subpopulations, but correlations and connectivity in many cortical circuits depend on continuous quantities like physical distance or tuning similarity 36, 19, 21 . Next, we generalize these findings to more biologically realistic networks with connection probabilities that depend on neuron distance. A spatially extended network model We next considered a network of N e =40,000 excitatory and N i =10,000 inhibitory model neurons arranged on a square-shaped domain modeling a portion of a cortical layer. The neurons receive feedforward synaptic input from a separate layer of Poisson-spiking neurons and are connected with a probability that decays with distance (Figure 2 ). Specifically, the probability of a connection between two neurons in the recurrent network obeys where d is the distance between the neurons measured along the two-dimensional network, ~ denotes proportionality, g(d;σ 2 )~exp(-d 2 /(2σ 2 )) is a Gaussian-shaped function and α rec approximately represents the average length of a recurrent synaptic projection. Similarly, the probability of a synaptic projection from a neuron in the feedforward layer to a neuron in the recurrent layer decays with distance like a Gaussian with width parameter α ffwd , where distance is measured parallel to the cortical surface (Figure 2 ). We next show that the asynchronous state is realized when α rec <α ffwd , then show that the asynchronous state cannot be realized when α rec >α ffwd . The asynchronous state in spatially extended cortical circuits As above, asynchronous spiking requires a cancellation between input covariances, cf. Eq. ( 1 ), except that d now represents continuous instead of binary distance. Therefore, conditions on asynchrony require first an understanding of how input covariances depend on pairwise neuron distance. Overlapping feedforward synaptic projections introduce O(1) correlations between the feedforward inputs to neuron pairs. Since nearby pairs share more feedforward inputs, these correlations are distance-dependent. Specifically, synaptic divergence causes feedforward input correlations to be twice as broad as synaptic projection widths (Figure 2b ), The fact that C FF (d)~O(1) at first seems to preclude the possibility of an asynchronous state since C FF (d) is one component of C II (d) in Eq. ( 1 ) and the asynchronous state requires C II (d)~O(1/N). However, the asynchronous state is realized under a cancellation between positive (C FF and C RR ) and negative (C RF ) sources of correlations in Eq. ( 1 ). Cancellation at all distances requires that all correlation sources have the same shape (Supplementary Note S.1), meaning that (2)   The implications of this requirement on the spatial profile of spiking correlations are clarified by noting that recurrent synaptic input is generated by spike trains in the. Synaptic divergence causes the correlations between neurons' recurrent synaptic inputs to be broader in space than the correlations between spike trains according to (Figure 2c ) Here, σ RR is the width of correlations between neurons' recurrent synaptic input currents and σ SS is the width of spike train correlations in the recurrent network. In general, we use α's to denote the widths of synaptic projections and σ's to denote the widths of correlations. Correlations between recurrent inputs are constrained by the cancellation required in the asynchronous state. Specifically, Eq. ( 2 ) requires that the width of correlations between recurrent synaptic inputs satisfies Combining the two expressions for σ RR above yields (3)   The existence of a real solution to Eq. ( 3 ) requires that α ffwd >α rec ; in other words, the spatial width of the recurrent projections must be narrower than the width of feedforward projections for the asynchronous state to exist. Further, Eq. ( 3 ) implies that σ 2 SS >σ 2 FF -α 2 rec so that spike train correlations are spatially narrower than correlations between feedforward input currents. Thus, recurrent dynamics actively sharpen the spatial profile of correlations in the asynchronous state (compare to the sharpening of tuning curves in previous work 37 ). To test these theoretical findings, we performed network simulations with feedforward synaptic projections broader than recurrent projections (Figure 3a ). The simulations confirmed that C RR (d) and C RF (d) decayed similarly with distance to C FF (d) (Figure 3b red, purple and blue). This allowed a cancellation between positive and negative sources of correlations, so that correlations between neurons' total synaptic currents and between their spike trains were weak over all distances (Figure 3b-e ). Despite their small average, spike count correlations had a larger standard deviation (stdev=0.11; Figure 3d ), consistent with results for non-spatial networks 23 (Figure 1b ). Neurons in the network receive strong excitation that is canceled by strong inhibition on average (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 4a, b ), confirming that the network maintains a balanced state. Correlations computed from simulations agreed with closed-form mathematical predictions (Figure 3e , compare black and dashed red; see Supplementary Note S.1 for equations). Additional simulations confirmed that mean correlations decay toward zero at increasing network size (Supplementary Note S.2 and Supplementary Figure 4c, d ). Broad lateral connections produce a signature spatial correlation structure As noted above, the cancellation between positive and negative correlations necessary for the asynchronous state cannot be realized when recurrent projections are broader than feedforward (α rec >α ffwd ) since Eq. ( 3 ) cannot be solved in this case. Instead, neuron pairs inherit correlations from overlapping feedforward inputs so that C SS (d)~O(1). This prediction was confirmed by numerical simulations identical to those discussed above, but with recurrent projections broader than feedforward (Figure 4a ). As predicted, recurrent input correlations (Figure 4b , red and purple) were too spatially broad to cancel with the more sharply decaying feedforward correlations (Figure 4b , blue) so that the total input correlation between nearby neurons was large (Figure 4b , black; compare to Figure 3b ). This effect introduced moderately strong correlations between nearby spike trains (Figure 4c, d, e ) that do not decay to zero at increasing network size (Supplementary Note S.2 and Supplementary Figure 4e, f ). Nevertheless, the network maintained excitatory-inhibitory balance (Figure 4f and Supplementary Figure 4a, b ). Since recurrent inputs must cancel feedforward inputs in balanced networks, C RF (d) is negative (Figures 1, 3 and 4 ; Supplementary Note S.1). Moreover, broad recurrent projections cause C RF (d) to decay slowly with distance (Figure 4b , purple). Through Eq. ( 1 ), this imparts a non-monotonicity in the dependence of C II (d) on d (Figure 4b , black) and spike count correlations inherit this non-monotonic shape (Figure 4e ). Following the same argument made for the homogeneous network, the spike count correlations averaged over neuron pairs at all distances is O(1/N) (Figure 4e , dashed gray and Supplementary Note S.1). However, as noted above, the average correlation over each distance cannot be O(1/N). Hence, there must be a cancellation between positive and negative correlations at different distances. As in Figure 1e -h, a competitive dynamic causes nearby neurons to be positively correlated and more distant neurons to be negatively correlated. This competitive dynamic does not extend beyond the reach of recurrent projections, so sufficiently distant neurons are weakly correlated. Hence, correlation decreases then increases with distance. This non-monotonicity can be explained more precisely using a mathematical theory of correlation transfer, (Figure 4e red dashed curve and Supplementary Note S.1). The heterogeneity of positive and negative correlations at different distances increases the standard deviation of pairwise correlations, but only modestly (stdev=0.16; Figure 4d , compare to Figure 3d ). In summary, when recurrent projections are spatially narrower than feedforward projections (α rec <α ffwd as in Figure 3 ), correlations are weak between pairs of neurons at all distances. When recurrent projections are broader than feedforward (α rec >α ffwd as in Figure 4 ), nearby neurons are positively correlated, neurons at moderate distances are negatively correlated and distant neurons are weakly correlated. Moreover, the average correlation between pairs of neurons sampled randomly at all distances is small. The non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance is a distinct signature of correlations arising from broad recurrent projections. We next investigate whether this correlation structure predicted by our theory is present in cortical recordings. Spatial correlation structure in a visual cortical circuit We next asked whether our theoretical characterization of correlations in spatially extended networks can explain correlations in a cortical circuit. Layers 2/3 and layer 4C of macaque primary visual cortex (L2/3 and L4C) provide an ideal circuit for testing our predictions. Pairs of neurons in L2/3 exhibit moderately large noise correlations that decay with distance, but neurons in L4C, which are a primary source of inter-laminar input to L2/3, exhibit extremely weak pairwise noise correlations 32, 33 (Figure 5 with data from previous studies 36, 33 ). Neurons in L4C receive much of their feedforward input from thalamic projections, which form spatially broad synaptic fields, around 1 mm in diameter, but lateral projections within macaque L4C form narrower, sub-millimeter, synaptic fields 34 . Thus, our theoretical prediction that correlations are weak when α ffwd >α rec is consistent with the weak pairwise correlations observed between L4C neurons in vivo (as in Figure 3 ). Inter-laminar projections from L4C to L2/3 have a similar sub-millimeter width as excitatory intra-laminar projections within L4C and lateral projections from inhibitory basket cells in L2/3 form sub-millimeter synaptic fields, similar to those in L4C 34 . Excitatory neurons in L2/3, however, form long-range lateral synaptic projections with synaptic fields spanning several millimeters in diameter 34 . Our theoretical results can be generalized to this setting where inhibitory and excitatory projections have different spatial profiles (Supplementary Note S.1). This extension predicts the same correlation structure reported in Figure 4 . However, correlations measured in L2/3 are positive on average over a broad range of distances 36 (Figure 5b ), in disagreement with this prediction. We hypothesized that this inconsistency is explained by recent studies showing that much of the correlated variability measured in L2/3 arises from a low-dimensional shared source of latent variability 38, 31, 30, 39, 40 . We conjectured that this shared variability increases pairwise correlations in L2/3 at all distances, thereby "washing out" the negative correlations predicted by our theory. To search for low-dimensional variability in our data, we used Gaussian process factor analysis 41, 31 (GPFA), a statistical algorithm that extracts shared fluctuations from a population of spike trains (see Materials and Methods). Applying this algorithm to our L2/3 recordings reveals a source of one-dimensional covariability that decays with distance (Figure 5c ). This distance-dependence implies that nearby neurons are affected similarly by the latent variable. To test whether one-dimensional latent variability explains the discrepancy between our theoretical predictions and data, we built a two-layer network model representing a 10 mm by 10 mm square of cortex (Figure 6a ). The first layer, representing L4C, was similar to the model in Figure 3 with the profile of feedforward and recurrent projections chosen to match experimentally constrained thalamic and lateral projection widths 34 . The second layer, representing L2/3, was similar to Figure 4 , with feedforward synaptic input from excitatory neurons in the L4C model and recurrent projection widths also chosen to match anatomical measurements. To capture latent variability in L2/3, the feedforward synaptic input to each neuron in the second layer was modulated by a time-varying, multiplicative gain modulation. We chose a multiplicative source of variability to be consistent with the properties of lowdimensional variability previously reported in macaque V1 31 , but an additive source of latent variability would produce similar overall results. The gain modulation contributes an O(√N) source of covariance to the feedforward inputs that the recurrent network cannot cancel 23 . To capture the distance-dependence of latent variability (Figure 5c ), the magnitude of the gain modulation was heterogeneous across the network in such a way that nearby neurons received similar modulations and more distant neurons received less similar modulations. Simulations of this two-layer model revealed that correlations between neurons in L4C were extremely small on average (Figure 6b ,c gray), consistent with our theoretical predictions (Figure 3 ) and consistent with in vivo recordings (Figure 5 ). Correlations in the model L2/3 layer were moderately large and positive over all distances (Figure 6b ,c black), comparable to in vivo recordings (Figure 5 ). Thus, our model recovers the coarse structure of correlations in L4C and L2/3. However, our explanation of positive correlations in L2/3 is unsatisfying because the addition of globally shared variability destroyed the distinct non-monotonic relationship between correlation and distance predicted by our theory (compare Figure 4e to Figure 6b ). We next asked whether this structure could be recovered by filtering out globally shared variability. To accomplish this, we computed the "residual correlation" matrix estimated by GPFA. Residual correlations approximate the spike count correlations with the contribution from lowdimensional variability removed 31 . Residual correlations computed between the simulated L2/3 spike trains exhibit the predicted non-monotonic dependence on distance, corroborating the ability of the GPFA algorithm to extract low-dimensional variability and leave the structure of residual correlations intact. We next computed the mean residual correlation in macaque L2/3 as a function of electrode distance. In doing so, we observed the same non-monotonic dependence of residual correlation on distance predicted by our theory (Figure 7b ; further statistical analysis in Supplementary Note S.3 and Supplementary Figure 5 ). In summary, combining theoretical analysis and computer simulations of a multi-layer network reveals a parsimonious model of the sources of shared variability in a visual cortical circuit in vivo. Under this model, positive correlations introduced by shared thalamic inputs to L4C neurons are actively canceled by negative correlations arising from recurrent circuitry so that pairs of L4C neurons at all distances exhibit weak average spike count correlations 32, 33 . Correlations between neurons in L2/3 are introduced by overlapping feedforward inputs from L4C and a low-dimensional source of variability. Correlations arising from overlapping L4C projections are filtered by recurrent circuitry in L2/3 to promote a non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance. This non-monotonic correlation structure is washed out by low-dimensional latent variability, but can be recovered using GPFA to estimate and remove this variability. Discussion Previous theoretical work on spatially homogeneous balanced networks with dense connectivity shows that they produce very weak spike train correlations 23 . We have generalized this theory to account for heterogeneous inputs and distance-dependent connection probability. In this framework we have made two important discoveries. First, in agreement with the original findings, when lateral synaptic projections are spatially narrower than incoming feedforward projections, correlations are extremely weak on average at all distances. This theoretical finding can explain the weak pairwise correlations observed between neurons in middle layers of macaque primary visual cortex 32, 33 . However, correlations measured in cortical recordings are not always weak 25 . Our second finding is that networks with broader lateral than feedforward projections produce correlations that do not decay to zero at increasing network size. In previous studies of balanced networks with spatially homogeneous or clustered connectivity 23,42 , the asynchrony condition (C SS ~O(1/N)) is satisfied and population averaged pairwise correlations vanish in the large network limit. In contrast, spatially extended networks with broad lateral projections violate the asynchrony condition, and consequently the expected pairwise correlations at a specific distance do not vanish. Nonetheless, mean excitatory and inhibitory currents balance and firing rates are moderate even when the asynchrony condition is violated (Supplementary Figure 4a, b and Supplementary Note S.1). This represents a novel solution for balanced networks that, for the first time, formally decouples network-wide asynchrony from excitatory-inhibitory balance. We focused on the dependence of correlations on distance, but correlations also depend on tuning similarity. Partitioning L2/3 neuron pairs by tuning similarity reveals that correlations are strongest between similarly tuned neurons 36 (Supplementary Figure 6a, b ). Modifying our computational model to capture tuning-dependent correlations produces a non-monotonic dependence of residual correlation on tuning similarity in some parameter regimes, but the relevant parameters have not been measured experimentally (Supplementary Figure 6c-e and Supplementary Note S.4). Nevertheless, the modified theory could explain negative correlations previously observed in computer simulations of networks with tuning-specific connectivity 32 and the finding that negative correlations are more frequent between disparately tuned neurons in V1 43 . As with nearly any computational model, many of the parameters used in our simulations may not reflect their corresponding values in specific cortical areas of specific species. However, our theoretical analysis does not depend on the precise values of these parameters. Our finding that the asynchronous state requires α rec <α ffwd is a fundamental property of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition. We used a simplified model of a visual cortical circuit. In reality, pyramidal neurons in V1 form both local and long-range projections, connection probability in primate V1 depends on both distance and tuning similarity, and these dimensions are coupled 44 . Moreover, connectivity properties of inhibitory neurons depend on their sub-type 45 . We modeled unidirectional connections from L4 to L2/3, but L4 also receives indirect feedback from L2/3 through deeper cortical layers. Spike trains in our model feedforward layer were modeled by homogeneous Poisson processes, in contrast to the oscillatory firing rates evoked by drifting grating stimuli in the data we analyzed. Our model can be extended to account for these additional features without affecting our overall conclusions. Our findings have important implications for the interpretation of correlations in neural recordings. The average (residual) correlation between cell pairs sampled across a large range of distances could be extremely small, even when nearby pairs are positively correlated with moderate magnitude (Figures 4 and 7 ). Hence, subtracting low-dimensional latent variability and partitioning neuron pairs by distance can reveal correlation structure that would otherwise not be apparent. A previous study 31 computed residual correlations as a function of distance in primate V1, but did not report a non-monotonic dependence. While we cannot be certain why their findings differ from ours, the accurate estimation of residual correlations with GPFA depends on the amount of data used to estimate shared variability. Our data are well-suited for this purpose, as they contain over 800 pairs of units per recording on average. There is a long history of computational models of cortical circuits that consider either networks with spatially dependent coupling 1 or balanced excitation and inhibition in spatially homogeneous networks 7, 23 . Only recently has the spatial structure of cortical connectivity been included in networks with balanced excitation and inhibition 46, 9, 37 , and guiding theoretical principles are lacking. Our theory has taken this spatial structure into account and produced two core predictions for cortical circuits with long range lateral connections: First, nearby neurons exhibit significant positive correlations; second, the dependence of pairwise correlation on pairwise distance is non-monotonic. These predictions are clearly falsifiable and hence represent strong tests of our theory. The superficial layers of visual cortex have long-range lateral connections 34 , making them a suitable test bed for our theory of correlations. After accounting for a source of global variability, both of our predictions were verified from population recordings in macaque V1 (Figure 7 ). Further, a similar noise correlation structure was reported in recordings from mouse V1 47 . The successful validation of our predictions marks our theory as a promising framework for studying the structure of neural variability in cortical circuits. Nevertheless, there are many aspects of cortical dynamics that remain unexplained by balanced networks, such infrequent yet large membrane fluctuations during spontaneous dynamics 15, 48 . Capturing these dynamics in cortical models with balanced architectures remains an open challenge. Experimental Procedures Description of computational model We modeled a square of cortex with N neurons, N e of which are excitatory and N i inhibitory. The membrane potential of neuron j from the excitatory (a = e) or inhibitory (a = i) population obeyed exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF) dynamics, each time that exceeds a threshold at V th , the neuron spikes and the membrane potential is held for a refractory period τ ref then reset to a fixed value V re . The leak current is given by I L (V) = -g L (V -E L ) and a spike-generating current is defined by f For the model in Figure 1 , there were N = 20,000 neurons, half of which were excitatory and half inhibitory. For each (presynaptic) neuron, we randomly and uniformly chose 2500 excitatory and 2500 inhibitory postsynaptic neurons in the network. Postsynaptic neurons were sampled with replacement, so that a single presynaptic neuron can make multiple contacts with a postsynaptic neuron. The synaptic weight of each connection depended on the pre-and postsynaptic neuron types (excitatory or inhibitory). Specifically, (5)   where j ee = 12.5mV, j ie = 20 mV and j ii = j ei = -50 mV. Note that synaptic weights were scaled by √N= 141 in Eq. ( 4 ), so that the actual synaptic weight of each contact was on the order of 0.1mV. (V) = g L Δ T exp[(V -V T )/Δ T ]. For Figure 1a-d the input current. The model for Figure 1e -h was identical, except that two independent realizations, s 1 (t) and s 2 (t), of the shared input were generated. Half of the neurons received s 1 (t) and the other half received s 2 (t). Firing rates for Figure 1a -d were 7.6 Hz on average for excitatory neurons and 3.8 Hz for inhibitory neurons. For Figure 1e -h, average firing rates were 7.4 Hz for excitatory and 3.8 Hz for inhibitory neurons. To model the spatially extended recurrent network in Figures 3 and 4 , we arranged N e = 40,000 excitatory and N i =10,000 inhibitory EIF model neurons on a uniform grid covering a two-dimensional square domain. The feedforward layer was modeled by a population of N F = 5625 excitatory Poisson-spiking neurons on a uniform grid covering a square that is parallel to the recurrent network. Feedforward input to the recurrent layer was defined by where is the nth spike time of neuron k in the feedforward layer. Each spike train in the feedforward layer was modeled as independent Poisson processes with rate r F = 5 Hz. To simplify calculations, we measured distance in units of the side-length of the square domain. In these units, the domain is represented as the unit square, Γ = [0, 1] × [0, 1]. Neurons were connected randomly and the probability that two neurons were connected depended on their distance measured periodically on Γ. The precise algorithm for generating connections is described in Supplementary Note S.5. This algorithm assures that the expected number of synaptic contacts from a presynaptic neuron at coordinates y = (y 1 , y 2 ) in population b to a postsynaptic neuron at x = (x 1 , x 2 ) in population a is given by where g(u; α) is a wrapped Gaussian distribution 37 . Out-degrees were and . It follows that the network-wide average number of synaptic inputs to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the recurrent network was K = 3715. Synaptic weights were determined by Eq. ( 5 ) where j ee = 40 mV, j ie = 120 mV, j ei = j ii = -400 mV, and j eF = j iF = 120 mV. Note again that these terms were divided by √N ≈ 224 as indicated in Eq. ( 4 ), so that the actual synaptic weights were between 0.18 mV and 1.8 mV. Excitatory and inhibitory recurrent projection widths were α rec = α e = α i = 0.05 for Figure 3 and α rec = 0.25 for Figure 4 . Feedforward connection widths were α ffwd = 0.1 in both figures. For the simulations in Figure 3 , average firing rates were 3.9 Hz for excitatory and 6.2 Hz for inhibitory neurons. For the simulations in Figure 4 , average rates were 4.0 Hz for excitatory and 6.1 Hz for inhibitory neurons. The first layer (L4C) in the model in Figure 6 was identical to the model in Figure 3 except that α ffwd = 0.1, α e = 0.05 and α i = 0.03. The length units used in Figures 6 and 7a were determined by interpreting the network domain, Γ, as a 10 mm by 10 mm square. Thus, in physical dimensions, α ffwd = 1 mm, α e = 0.5 mm and α i = 0.3 mm. Average firing rates in the L4C layer were 3.7 Hz for excitatory and 6.1 Hz for inhibitory neurons. Connectivity in the second layer (L2/3) in Figure 6 was identical to the L4C layer except that α e = 0.15 (or 1.5 mm), α ffwd = 0.05 (or 0.5 mm). The spike times from Eq. ( 6 ) for the L2/3 layer were given by the spike times of neurons in the L4C layer, so that N F = 50,000. The magnitude of feedforward connectivity was also modified by setting K eF = 1406, K iF = 113 and j eF = j iF = 220 mV. A shared gain modulation was implemented by altering feedforward input currents according to The shared gain modulation, L(t), is a realization of unbiased Gaussian noise defined by its auto-covariance function, with correlation timescale τ L = 40 ms. The dimensionless weight factor, w L (x), depended on the coordinates, x = (x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ Γ, of the neuron and was given by where c = 0.5 and σ L = 0.25 (in physical dimensions, c = 5 mm and σ L = 2.5 mm) so that neurons near the center of the network to receive a more intense gain modulation and the strength of the modulation decays slowly with distance from the center. This imparted a long-range distance dependence to the correlations (Figure 6c ), similar to that observed in the cortical recordings (Figure 5b ). Average firing rates in the L2/3 layer were 5.7 Hz for excitatory and 9.1 Hz for inhibitory neurons. All simulations and numerical computations were performed on a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9.5 with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor. All simulations were written in a combination of C and Matlab (Matlab R 2014b, Mathworks). The differential equations defining the neuron model were solved using a simple forward Euler method with time step 0.1 ms and all simulations were run for a 22 s duration. Experimental methods Anesthesia was induced with ketamine (10 mg/kg) and maintained during preparatory surgery with isoflurane (1.0-2.0% in 95% O2). Anesthesia during recordings was maintained with sufentanil citrate (6-18 μg•kg -1 •h -1 ). Vecuronium or pancuronium bromide (0.1-0.15 mg•kg -1 •h -1 ) was used to suppress eye movements. Physiological signs were monitored to ensure adequate anesthesia and animal well-being. Vital signs (EEG, ECG, blood pressure, end-tidal P CO2 , temperature, and airway pressure) were monitored continuously. We used supplementary lenses to bring the retinal image into focus. At the end of the recording session, animals were killed and tissue was processed histologically to verify recording locations. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The pairwise correlations used to make the distributions in Figure 5a were computed using the same methods to those reported previously 33 and include 1,613 L2/3 pairs and 469 L4 pairs. The data were recorded from nine anesthetized, adult male macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Recording were made with a group of five to seven linearly arranged (305 μm spacing) platinum-tungsten electrodes or tetrodes (Thomas Recording), inserted normally to the cortical surface. The electrodes were advanced together through cortex, sampling in 200 μm intervals until all electrodes had exited into white matter. Location of the middle layer sites involved a number of criteria including nominal depth, histology, and CSD analysis, as detailed previously 33 . Data for distance-dependent correlations reported in Figures 5b, 5c and 7b were from recordings described previously 36 . The data were recorded from seven hemispheres of four adult male macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). There was one experimental group of normal animals. The array consisted of a 10×10 grid of silicon microelectrodes (1 mm in length) spaced 400 μm apart. We inserted the array partially into cortex, resulting in recordings confined mostly to layers 2-3. In two cases, we recorded simultaneously with a group of seven linearly arranged (2 mm extent) platinum-tungsten microelectrodes or tetrodes (Thomas Recording), positioned so that the nearest electrode was ~5 mm anterior to one edge of the multielectrode array. In this configuration, the distances between these electrodes and the array ranged from ~5 to 10mm. Neuronal receptive fields in all data sets were within 5° of the fovea. Waveform segments that exceeded a user-defined threshold were sorted offline (Plexon Offline Sorter). We quantified sort quality using the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of each candidate unit 49 , keeping units with an SNR of at least 2.3 (for the data in Figure 5a ) or at least 2.75 (for Figures 5b and 7b ). In both data sets, we eliminated neurons for which the best grating stimulus did not evoke a response of at least 2 spikes/s. Changing the SNR or responsivity threshold did not qualitatively change any of the results described herein. Visual stimuli were generated with EXPO and displayed on a linearized CRT monitor (mean luminance 40 cd/m 2 ) with a resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels and a refresh rate of 100 Hz. Stimuli were presented in a circular aperture surrounded by a gray field of average luminance. We mapped the spatial receptive field (RF) of units by presenting small (0.6°) drifting gratings at a range of spatial positions. We then centered our stimuli on the aggregate RF of the recorded units. Stimuli were viewed binocularly and presented for 1.28 s, separated by 1.5 s intervals of isoluminant gray screen (except in one penetration, for which the interval was 10 s). We presented full-contrast drifting sinusoidal gratings at 8 or 12 orientations spaced equally (22.5 or 30° increments). The spatial frequency (1-1.3 cpd) and temporal frequency (3 or 6.25 Hz) values were chosen to correspond to the typical preference of parafoveal V1 neurons 50 . The position and size (3.9-10°) of the grating were sufficient to cover the receptive fields of all the neurons. Stimulus orientation was block randomized, each stimulus orientation was repeated 100-200 times per recording session and each of the eight recording sessions yielded 21-68 units (210-2278 pairs) that met our SNR and responsivity thresholds. This yielded a total of 318 units and 6,907 simultaneously recorded pairs. Statistical methods To compute spike count correlations for Figures 1, 3 , 4 and 6 we first randomly sampled a subset of the excitatory neurons in the recurrent network. The number of neurons sampled is indicated in each figure caption. Neurons with firing rates less than 1 Hz were excluded from the correlation analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed by counting spikes over 250 ms windows then computing the Pearson correlation coefficients between all pairs. The first 2 s of each simulation was excluded from the correlation analysis. To obtain the residual correlations in Figure 7a , we randomly sampled 500 neurons with firing rates above 2 Hz from the L2/3 layer simulations. After omitting the first 2 s of the simulation, spike counts were computed using 50 ms bins, then partitioned into a sequence of 250 ms windows. To each window, we directly applied the GPFA algorithm used in a previous study 31 and downloaded from http://toliaslab.org/publications/ecker-et-al-2014/. This is a modified version of the algorithm introduced previously 41 . Briefly, GPFA extracts shared fluctuations from a population of spike trains by fitting spike count covariance matrices to a model of the form Here, c is a column vector of coefficients quantifying the contribution of latent variability to each neuron's spiking activity. Latent variability is modeled by a one-dimensional Gaussian stochastic process. Hence, cc T is a rank-one matrix of latent covariances and Q quantifies the residual covariability not captured by the latent variable. Residual correlations were computed using the "window" option (so that spike count covariances were computed over 250ms windows) then converting the resulting covariance matrix, Q, to a correlation matrix using the corrcov command in Matlab (Mathworks). Spike count correlations in Figure 5b were computed across trials, counting spikes over 250ms time bins and subtracting the trial-averaged rate of each unit over each stimulus orientation. Hence, all reported spike count correlations represent correlated trial-to-trial variability (noise correlations) with stimulus correlations removed. Latent covariance in Figure 5c and residual correlation in Figure 7b were computed from the mean-subtracted spike counts using 50ms time bins and 250ms window sizes (treating each 250ms window as a separate trial) then using the same GPFA algorithms and procedures that were used for the simulated data in Figure 7a (see description above). The three p-values reported in Figure 7b were computed using one-sided, unpaired t-tests with t-values 8.1, 2.1 and 2.5 and degrees of freedom 3,937, 2,404 and 2,508 respectively. 2 with recurrent projections narrower than feedforward projections (α rec = 0.5 α ffwd ). b) Average covariance between different sources of synaptic currents to excitatory neuron pairs as a function of distance. Positive covariance between neurons' feedforward input currents (blue) and between their recurrent input currents (red) cancel with negative covariance between one neuron's feedforward and the other neuron's recurrent input (purple) to produce weak covariance between their total input (black). Curves were computed from input currents to 400 randomly selected excitatory neurons and were normalized by the peak feedforward input covariance. c) Spike rasters of the 400 excitatory neurons comprising the center 20×20 square of neurons in the recurrent layer. d) Normalized histogram of pairwise spike count correlation between 5000 randomly selected neurons. e) Mean spike count correlation between neurons (±SEM) as a function of their distance.

Correlations decreased in the first two bins (p<10 -12 ; un-paired t-test), increased from the third to fourth bin (p = 0.019) and from the third to the fifth bin (p = 0.0067). For excitatory neurons, τ m = C m /g L = 15ms, E L = -60mV, V T = -50mV, V th = -10mV, Δ T = 2mV, V re = -65mV and τ ref = 1.5ms. Inhibitory neurons were the same except τ m = 10ms, Δ T = 0.5mV and τ ref = 0.5ms. Synaptic input currents were defined by where F a (t) is the feedforward input and R a (t) the recurrent input to neuron j in population a = e, i. The feedforward input was modeled differently for different figures, as described below. The recurrent input was defined by (4) where is the nth spike time of neuron k in population b = e, i. The 1/√N scaling of synaptic weights is a defining feature of the balanced network formalism and captures the balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents as well as intrinsically generated temporal variability for large N 7 . Each term represents the synaptic weight from presynaptic neuron k in population b to postsynaptic neuron j in population a. For all simulations, we modeled synaptic kinetics using η b (t) = exp(-t/τ b )/τ b for t > 0 where τ e = 6ms and τ i = 5ms. All networks are "dense" in the sense that connection probabilities are O(1) 23 . , the feedforward input to each neuron was given by the sum of an input bias and a smoothly varying signal, Here, s(t) is a shared source of smooth, unbiased Gaussian noise defined by its auto-covariance function, τ s = 40ms sets the correlation timescale and σ s = 0.1 mV/ms scales the magnitude of the fluctuations. The terms m e = 0.015 mV/ms and m i = 0.01 mV/ms introduce a static bias to Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Currents in (h) are from neurons within population 2. Histograms in (f) show correlations from neuron pairs randomly selected from both populations (black) from the same population (purple) and from opposite populations (green). Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2.

Broad recurrent projections lead to a correlated balanced state a-f) Same as Figure3a-e except recurrent projections were changed to be broader than feedforward projections (α rec = 2.5 α ffwd ). This change prevented the recurrent network from canceling positive feedforward input correlations (b), resulting in population-wide spike count correlations with increased standard deviation (c,d) and with positive correlations between nearby neurons but negative correlations between more distant neurons (e). Nevertheless, the network maintains balance (f). Figure 5 . 5 Figure 5.

INTRODUCTION Although much has been discovered about the anatomy and pharmacology of the basal ganglia, there has been much less research systematically investigating their functions in adaptive behavior. The considerable interest in neuropathology, particularly of the dorsal striatum and its midbrain dopaminergic afferents, associated with disorders, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (Saint-Cyr et al, 1995), Parkinson's (Antonini et al, 2001 ) and Huntington's diseases (Joel, 2001 ), Tourette's syndrome (Marsh et al, 2004) , and so on, has implicated this structural network in various aspects of action control. However, historically, these functions have been argued to be limited to the bottom-up regulation of motor movement through output to the pallidum, thalamus, and to motor and premotor cortices (Mink, 1996) . More recently, however, interest has turned to potential role of the basal ganglia in the top-down or executive control of motor movement (Miller, 2008) . This interest has largely been fueled by new, more detailed, models of the neuroanatomy that have linked feedforward inputs through the corticostriatal circuit with these feedback functions through a network of partially closed cortico-basal ganglia loops (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990b; Nambu, 2008) . In addition, this recent approach has led to integration of some previously poorly characterized aspects of basal ganglia function with motor control, particularly its role in decision-making based on affective or reward processes. Considerable research has long suggested that the ventral striatum has a critical role in the motivational control of action, a suggestion captured in the characterization of this region as a limbic-motor interface (Kelley, 2004; Mogenson et al, 1980) . However, recent research has also implicated the dorsal striatum in the control of decisionmaking regulated by reward, particularly the role of the caudate or dorsomedial region of the striatum in the integration of reward-related processes with action control (Balleine et al, 2007c) . This research suggests that the striatum has a much broader role in the control of executive functions than previously suspected and, indeed, appears to be centrally involved in functions long argued to depend solely on the regions of prefrontal cortex (Balleine et al, 2007a; Lauwereyns et al, 2002; Tanaka et al, 2006) . Reconciling the motor with the non-motor, cognitive aspects of basal ganglia function in the production and control of adaptive behavior has become a matter of considerable speculation and debate, and a number of theories have been advanced based around the new and developing description of the neuroanatomy and neuropharmacology of basal ganglia and its composite subregions (Bar-Gad et al, 2003; Hazy et al, 2007; Joel et al, 2002; McHaffie et al, 2005) . However, it must be conceded that, although promissory, much of this theorizing has been driven by these structural advances with relatively little consideration of evidence (or lack of evidence) regarding the functions of the circuitry involved (Nambu, 2008) . In this review, we describe recent research from our laboratories that addresses this issue focusing particularly on collaborative projects through which we have started to assess homologous functions of corticostriatal circuitry in both executive and motor learning processes and in the motivational control of action in rodents and humans. We begin by considering behavioral evidence for multiple sources of action control and recent evidence implicating regions of dorsal striatum in the cognitive and sensorimotor control of actions. We then consider the evidence for two, apparently independent, sources of motivational control mediated by reward and by stimuli that predict reward and the role of distinct cortico-ventral striatal networks in these functions. Finally, we consider the role of basal ganglia generally in the integration of the learning and motivational processes through which courses of action are acquired, selected, and implemented to determine adaptive decision-making and choice. MULTIPLE SOURCES OF ACTION CONTROL IN RODENTS AND HUMANS: GOALS AND HABITS There is now considerable evidence to suggest that the performance of reward-related actions in both rats and humans reflects the interaction of two quite different learning processes, one controlling the acquisition of goal-directed actions, and the other the acquisition of habits. This evidence suggests that, in the goal-directed case, action selection is governed by an association between the response 'representation' and the 'representation' of the outcome engendered by those actions, whereas in the case of habit learning, action selection is controlled through learned stimulus-response (S-R) associations without any associative link to the outcome of those actions. As such, actions under goal-directed control are performed with regard to their consequences, whereas those under habitual control are more reflexive in nature, by virtue of their control by antecedent stimuli rather than their consequences. It should be clear, therefore, that goal-directed and habitual actions differ in two primary ways: (1) they differ in their sensitivity to changes in the value of the consequences previously associated with the action; and (2) they differ in their sensitivity to changes in the causal relationship between the action and those consequences. Generally, two kinds of experimental test have been used to establish these differences, referred to as outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, respectively. Outcome Devaluation It is now nearly 30 years since it was first demonstrated that rats are capable of encoding the consequences of their actions. In an investigation of the learning processes controlling instrumental conditioning in rats, Adams and Dickinson (1981) were able to demonstrate that, after they were trained to press a lever for sucrose, devaluing the sucrose by pairing its consumption with illness (induced by an injection of lithium chloride) caused a subsequent reduction in performance when the rats were again allowed to lever press in an extinction test; ie, in the absence of any feedback from the delivery of the now devalued outcome. In the absence of this feedback during the test, the reduction in performance suggested that the rats encoded the lever press-sucrose association during training and were able to integrate that learning with the experienced change in the value of the sucrose to alter their subsequent performance. This demonstration was of central importance because, at the time, the available evidence suggested that lever-press acquisition was controlled solely by sensorimotor learning, involving a process of S-R association. Adams and Dickinson's (1981) finding was the first direct evidence to contradict this view and to suggest that animals are capable of a more elaborate form of encoding based on the response-outcome (R-O) association. It is important to recognize that evidence of R-O encoding did not necessarily imply that animals could not or did not learn by S-R association and, indeed, subsequent evidence has suggested that both processes can be encouraged depending on the training conditions. Adams (1981) found early on that the influence of devaluation on lever pressing was dependent on the amount of training; that, after a period of overtraining, the lever pressing by rats appeared to be no longer sensitive to devaluation. This was consistent with the view that R-O learning dominated performance early after acquisition but gave way to an S-R process, as performance became more routine or habitual (see also Dickinson, 1994; Dickinson et al, 1995) . Importantly, very similar effects have been found in human subjects. In a recent study, for example, we (Tricomi et al, 2009) trained human subjects to press different buttons to gain access to symbols corresponding to small quantities of two different snack foods (one of which they were given to eat at the end of the session). When allowed to eat a particular snack food until satiated, thereby selectively devaluing that snack food, undertrained subjects subsequently reduced their performance of the action associated with the devalued snack food compared with that of an action associated with a non-devalued snack food in an extinction test. In contrast, after overtraining, performance was no longer sensitive to snack food devaluation and subjects responded similarly on both the action associated with the devalued outcome and the action associated with the non-devalued outcome. Devaluation effects have also been demonstrated when assessed using choice between different actions. Rats trained on two different action-outcome associations have been found to alter their choice between actions in an extinction test after one or other outcome has been devalued either by taste aversion learning (Colwill and Rescorla, 1985) or by specific satiety induced by a period of free consumption of one or other training outcome (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998a, b) . Valentin et al (2007) reported a similar devaluation effect on choice performance in humans, using a training procedure in which subjects were allowed to make stochastic choices between two icons, one paired with a high probability chocolate milk or low probability orange juice and, in a second pair of icons, one paired with high probability tomato juice and the other the low probability orange juice. When subsequently sated on the chocolate milk or tomato juice, their choice of the specific icon associated with the now devalued outcome was reduced, whereas choice of the icon paired with the other non-devalued outcome was not. Thus, whether assessed using an undertrained free operant action or by means of choice between two actions, both rodents and humans show sensitivity to outcome devaluation. Furthermore, in both species overtraining produces insensitivity to outcome devaluation suggesting that performance has become habitual. These findings suggest, therefore, that both rodents and humans are capable of goal-directed and habitual forms of behavioral control. Contingency Degradation In addition to differences in associative structure, demonstrated by differential sensitivity to devaluation, the R-O and S-R learning processes appear also to be driven by different learning rules. Traditionally S-R learning was argued to reflect the operation of a contiguity learning rule, subsequently referred to as Hebbian-learning. As one might expect, this proposed that S-R learning is governed by contiguous activation of sensory and motor processes (Hebb, 1949) . On a pure contiguity account (Guthrie, 1935) that is all that is required whereas, according to the S-R/reinforcement view (Hull, 1943) , the association of contiguously active sensory and motor processes is strengthened by a reinforcement-related signal that does not itself form part of the associative structure and acts merely as a catalyst to increase the associative strength between S and R. On this latter view, every time an action is reinforced its association with any prevailing, contiguously active, situational stimuli is increased. This view predicts, naturally enough, that S-R learning should be constrained to the stimuli under which training is conducted and, indeed, in an interesting demonstration, Killcross and Coutureau (2003) found evidence of contextual control of S-R learning induced by overtraining one action in one context and undertraining a different action in a different context. When tested in the overtrained context the action was insensitive to outcome devaluation; when tested in the undertrained context, it was not and showed the normal sensitivity to devaluation indicative of control by an R-O learning process. By extension, the training of actions under distinct discriminative stimuli should also be anticipated to restrict S-R control to the performance assessed under that particular stimulus relative to other stimuli, consistent with aspects of previous reports (Colwill and Rescorla, 1990; De Wit et al, 2006) . In contrast, R-O learning is not determined by simple contiguity between action and outcome. This has been demonstrated in a variety of studies, first by Hammond (1980) and later in a number of better-controlled demonstrations (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998a; Colwill and Rescorla, 1986; Dickinson and Mulatero, 1989; Williams, 1989 ). Thus, for example, when action-outcome contiguity is maintained, non-contiguous delivery of the outcome of an action causes a selective reduction in the performance of that action relative to actions not paired with that outcome. Generally, if a specific outcome is more probable given performance of a specific action, then the strength of the R-O association increases. If the outcome has an equal or greater probability of delivery in the absence of the action, then the R-O association declines. This increase and decrease in the strength of association suggests that, unlike S-R learning, R-O learning is sensitive to the contingency between R and O rather than R-O contiguity. In contrast, S-R learning, being contiguity driven, should be insensitive to non-contiguous outcome delivery. In one study, Dickinson et al (1998) found that, compared with relatively under trained rats, overtrained rats were insensitive to a shift in contingency induced by the imposition of an omission schedule; ie, when rats were asked to withhold the performance of an action to earn a sucrose outcome, undertrained rats were able to do so, whereas overtrained rats were not. Thus, reversal of the contingency from positive (O depends on R) to negative (O depends on withholding R) affected undertrained actions, sensitive to outcome devaluation, but did not affect overtrained actions. Although the influence of overtraining on contingency sensitivity has not been assessed in human subjects, there is considerable evidence that rat actions and human causal judgments exhibit a comparable sensitivity to the degradation of the action-outcome contingency produced by the delivery of unpaired outcomes. Recall that an instrumental action can be rendered causally ineffective by delivering unpaired outcomes with the same probability as paired ones. In fact, just as the rate of lever pressing by rats declines systematically as the difference in the probability of the paired and unpaired outcomes is reduced (Hammond, 1980) , human performance declines similarly when the outcomes are given a nominal value (Shanks and Dickinson, 1991) and, more importantly, so do judgments regarding the causal efficacy of actions (Shanks and Dickinson, 1991; Wasserman et al, 1983) . Summary These behavioral studies provide consistent evidence of two different associative processes through which actions can be acquired and controlled. One of these, R-O learning, reflects the formation of associations between actions and their consequences or outcomes, a process that explains the sensitivity of newly acquired actions and of choice between distinct courses of action to changes in the value of their consequences and in the contingent relationship between performance of the action and delivery of its associated outcome. Given the clear and substantial regulation by their consequences, the rapid and relatively flexible deployment of actions controlled by the R-O association is clearly consistent with the claim that this learning process is critical to the acquisition and performance of goal-directed action specifically and to executive control of decision-making and choice between courses of action more generally. The second, S-R learning, process involves the formation of an association between the response and antecedent stimuli. Performance controlled by the S-R association is, therefore, stimulus-and, often, contextually bound, and relatively automatic, appearing impulsive or habitual and unregulated by its consequences. One might anticipate that these distinct learning and behavioral processes would have quite distinct neural determinants and recent research has confirmed this prediction. In the following section, we review evidence suggesting that homologous regions of the cortical-dorsal striatal network are involved in these learning processes in rats and humans, findings that have been established using many of the same behavioral tests described above. ROLE OF THE CORTICOSTRIATAL NETWORK IN GOAL-DIRECTED AND HABIT LEARNING IN RATS AND HUMANS Neural Substrates of Goal-Directed Learning In rats, two components of the corticostriatal circuit in particular have been implicated in goal-directed learning: the prelimbic region of prefrontal cortexFsee Figure 1aF and the area of dorsal striatum to which this region of cortex projects: the dorsomedial striatumFFigure 1d (Groenewegen et al, 1990; McGeorge and Faull, 1989; Nauta, 1989) . The networks described in this section are illustrated in Figure 2a . Lesions of either of these regions prevents the acquisition of goal-directed learning, rendering performance habitual even during the early stages of training, as assessed using either an outcome devaluation paradigm or contingency degradation (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998a; Corbit and Balleine, 2003b; Yin et al, 2005) . Importantly, prelimbic cortex, although necessary for initial acquisition, does not appear to be necessary for the expression of goal-directed behavior; lesions of this area do not impair goal-directed behavior if they are induced after initial training (Ostlund and Balleine, 2005) . On the other hand, dorsomedial striatum does appear to be critical for both the learning and expression of goal-directed behavior; lesions of this area impair such behavior if performed either before or after training (Yin et al, 2005) . The finding that the parts of rat prefrontal cortex contribute to action-outcome learning raises the question of whether there exists a homologous region of the primate on prefrontal cortex that contributes to similar functions. A number of fMRI studies in humans have found evidence that a part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is involved in encoding the expected reward attributable to chosen actions, which might suggest this region as a candidate area for a possible homolog. In a typical example, Daw et al (2006) used a four-armed bandit task in which subjects on each trial could choose one of the four bandits to obtain 'points' that could be obtained on the different bandits in varying amounts (that would later be converted into money). The amount of reward expected on a given bandit once it had been chosen was estimated using a reinforcement learning algorithm, which took into account the history of past rewards obtained on that bandit to generate a prediction about the future rewards likely attainable on a given trial. Activity in vmPFC (medial orbitofrontal cortex extending dorsally up the medial wall of prefrontal cortex) was found to correlate with the expected reward value derived from the RL model for the chosen action across trials. A similar finding has been obtained in a number of other studies using similar paradigms and approaches (Hampton et al, 2006; Kim et al, 2006; Tanaka et al, 2004) . These findings suggest that human vmPFC is involved in encoding value signals relevant for rewardbased action selection; however, the above studies did not deploy the behavioral assays necessary to determine whether such value signals are goal-directed or habitual. To address this issue, Valentin et al, (2007) performed an outcome devaluation procedure in humans, while subjects were scanned with fMRI during the performance of instrumental actions for food rewards. Following an initial (moderate) training phase, one of these foods was devalued by feeding the subject to satiety on that food. The subjects were then scanned again while they were re-exposed to the instrumental choice procedure in extinction. By testing for regions of the brain showing a change in activity during selection of a devalued action compared with that elicited during selection of a valued action from pre-to post-satiety, it was possible to isolate areas showing sensitivity to the learned action-outcome associations. The regions found to show such a response profile were medial OFC, as well as an additional part of central OFC. The aforementioned results would therefore appear to implicate at least a part of vmPFC in encoding action-outcome and not S-R associationsFsee Figure 1b . However, another possibility that cannot be ruled out on the basis of the Valentin et al (2007) study alone is that this region may instead contain a representation of the discriminative stimulus (in this case the fractals), used to signal the different available actions, and that the learned associations in this region may be formed between these stimuli and the outcomes obtained. In other words, the design of the Valentin et al (2007) study does not allow us to rule out a possible contribution of vmPFC to purely Pavlovian stimulus-driven valuation signals (see section 'The corticolimbic-ventral striatal network and the motivation of decision making' for further discussion of this point). Direct evidence of a role for vmPFC in encoding actionrelated value signals was provided by Gla ¨scher et al (2009) . In this study, the possible contribution of discriminative stimuli in driving expected-reward signals in vmPFC was probed using a specific design in which, in an 'action-based' condition, subjects had to choose between performing one of two different physical motor responses (rolling a trackerball vs pressing a button) in the absence of explicit discriminative stimuli signaling those actions. Subjects were given monetary rewards on a probabilistic basis according to their choice of the different physical actions, and the rewards available on the different actions changed over time. Similar to the results found in studies where both discriminative stimulus information and action-selection components are present, in this task, activity in vmPFC was found to track the expected reward corresponding to the chosen action. These results suggest that activity in vmPFC does not necessarily depend on the presence of discriminative stimuli, indicating that this region contributes to encoding of action-related value signals above and beyond any contribution this region might make to encode stimulus-related value signals. Further evidence that human vmPFC has a role in goaldirected learning, and in encoding action-outcome-based value signals specifically, has come from a study by Tanaka et al (2008) Fsee Figure 1c . In this study, rather than using outcome devaluation, areas exhibiting sensitivity to the contingency between actions and outcomes were assessed. As described earlier, sensitivity to action-outcome contingency is another key feature besides sensitivity to Photomicrograph of an NMDA-induced cell body lesion of prelimbic prefrontal cortex (right hemisphere) and approximate region of lesioninduced damage (orange oval; left hemisphere) found to abolish the acquisition of goal-directed action in rats (cf. Balleine and Dickinson, 1998a, b; Corbit and Balleine, 2003a, b; Ostlund and Balleine, 2005) . (b) Region of human vmPFC (here medial OFC) exhibiting a response profile consistent with the goal-directed system. Activity in this region during action selection for a liquid food reward was sensitive to the current incentive value of the outcome, decreasing in activity during the selection of an action leading to a food reward devalued through selective satiation compared to an action leading to a non-devalued food reward. From Valentin et al (2007) . (c) Regions of human vmPFC (medial prefrontal cortex and medial OFC) exhibiting sensitivity to instrumental contingency and thereby exhibiting response properties consistent with the goal-directed system. Activation plots show areas with increased activity during sessions with a high contingency between responses and rewards compared with sessions with low contingency. From Tanaka et al (2008) . (d) Photo-micrographs of NMDA-induced cell-body lesions of dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum (right hemisphere) with the approximate region of lesion-induced damage illustrated in using red and purple circles, respectively (left hemisphere). This lesion of dorsomedial striatum has been found to abolish acquisition and retention of goal-directed learning (cf. Yin et al, 2005) , whereas this lesion of dorsolateral striatum was found to abolish the acquisition of habit learning (Yin et al, 2004) . (e) Region of human anterior dorsomedial striatum exhibiting sensitivity to instrumental contingency from the same study described in panel c. (f) Region of posterior lateral striatum (posterior putamen) exhibiting a response profile consistent with the behavioral development of habits in humans. From Tricomi et al, 2009. changes in outcome value that distinguishes goal-directed learning from its habitual counterpart. To study this process in humans, Tanaka et al (2008) abandoned the traditional trial-based approach typically used in experiments using humans and nonhuman primates, in which subjects are cued to respond at particular times in a trial, for the unsignaled, self-paced approach more often used in studies of associative learning in rodents in which subjects themselves choose when to respond. Subjects were scanned with fMRI while in different sessions; they responded on four different free operant reinforcement schedules which varied in the degree of contingency between responses shown and rewards obtained. Consistent with the findings from outcome devaluation (Valentin et al, 2007) , activity in two subregions of vmPFC (medial OFC and medial prefrontal cortex) as well as one of the target areas of these structures in the human striatum, the anterior caudate nucleus (Haber et al, 2006; Ongu ¨r and Price, 2000) was elevated on average across a session when subjects were performing on a high-contingency schedule compared with when they were performing on a low-contingency schedule Fsee Figure 1e . Moreover, in the subregion of vmPFC identified on the medial wall, activity was found to vary not only with the overall contingency averaged across a schedule, but also with a locally computed estimate of the contingency between action and outcome that tracks rapid changes in contingency over time within a session, implicating this specific subregion of medial prefrontal cortex in the on-line computation of contingency between actions and outcomes. Finally, activation of medial prefrontal cortex also tracked a measure of subjective contingency; ie, the ratings of the subjects regarding the causal efficacy of their actions. This rating, taken after each trial block, positively correlated (approximately 0.6) with measures of objective contingency, suggesting that the medial vmPFC-caudate network may interact directly with medial prefrontal cortex to influence causal knowledge. Neural Substrates of Habit Learning The finding that medial prefrontal cortex and its striatal efferents contribute to goal-directed learning in both rats and humans, raises the question as to where in the corticostriatal network habitual S-R learning processes are implemented. Considerable earlier, although behaviorally indirect, evidence from studies using tasks that are nominally procedural and could potentially involve S-R learning (largely simple skill learning in humans or maze learning in rats) has implicated a region of dorsal striatum lateral to the caudate nucleusFreferred to as dorsolateral striatum in rat or putamen in primatesFin S-R encoding (see Figure 2a ). More direct evidence, based on the criteria described in section 'Multiple sources of action control in rodents and humans: goals and habits,' was provided in a study by Yin et al (2004) . Rats with lesions to a region of dorsolateral striatum were found to remain goal-directed even after extensive training which, in sham-lesioned controls, led to clear habitization; ie, whereas actions in lesioned rats remained sensitive to outcome devaluation those of sham controls did not. This increased sensitivity to the consequences of actions was observed both with outcome devaluation and contingency degradation procedures; in the latter case, overtrained rats were unable to adjust their performance of an action when responding caused the omission of reward delivery, whereas inactivation of dorsolateral striatum rendered rats sensitive to this omission contingency (Yin et al, 2006) . This finding suggests that this region of dorsolateral striatum has a critical role in the habitual control of behavior in rodentsFsee Figure 1d . To establish whether a similar area of striatum also contributes to such a process in humans, Tricomi et al (2009) scanned subjects with fMRI while they performed on a variable interval schedule for food rewards in which one group of subjects was overtrained to induce behavioral habitization. In the group that was given this procedure, Here, dopaminergic (DA) feedforward and feedback processes are illustrated involving VTA-accumbens shell and core and SNc-dorsal striatal networks. The involvement of the BLA in reward processes is illustrated, as is the hypothesized involvement of the inframbic cortex (IL) and central nucleus of the amygdala in the reinforcement signal derived from SNc afferents on dorsolateral stiatum. activity in a region of lateral striatum (caudo-ventral putamen) was found to show an increased activation on the third day of training when an outcome devaluation test revealed subjects' responding to be habitual, compared with the first day of training when responding in undertrained subjects was shown to be goal-directedFsee Figure 1f . These findings provide evidence to suggest that this region of posterolateral putamen in humans may correspond functionally to the area of striatum found to be critical for habitual control in rodents. Additional hints of a role for human caudoventral striatum in habitual control can be gleaned from fMRI studies of 'procedural' sequence learning (Jueptner et al, 1997a; Lehe ´ricy et al, 2005) . Such studies have reported a transfer of activity within striatum from the anterior striatum to posterior striatum as a function of training. Although these earlier studies did not formally assess whether behavior was habitual by the time that activity in posterolateral striatum had emerged, these studies did show that, by this time, sequence generation was insensitive to dual-task interference, a behavioral manipulation potentially consistent with habitization. Summary The evidence reviewed in this section, summarized in Figure 1 , suggests that there is considerable overlap in the corticostriatal circuitry that mediates goal-directed and habitual actions in humans and rodents. Rodent studies have implicated prelimbic cortex and its striatal efferents on dorsomedial striatum as a key circuit responsible for goaldirected learning. In a series of fMRI studies, vmPFC has been found to be involved in encoding reward predictions based on goal-directed action-outcome associations in humans, suggesting that this region of cortex in the primate prefrontal cortex is a likely functional homolog of prelimbic cortex in the rat. Furthermore, the area of anterior caudate nucleus found in humans to be modulated by contingency would seem to be a candidate homolog for the region of dorsomedial striatum implicated in goal-directed control in the rat. Finally, the evidence reviewed here supports the suggestion that a region of dorsolateral striatum in rodents and of the putamen in humans is involved in the habitual control of behavior, which when taken together with the findings on goal-directed learning reviewed previously, provides converging evidence that the neural substrates of these two systems for behavioral control are relatively conserved across mammalian species. THE CORTICOLIMBIC-VENTRAL STRIATAL NETWORK AND THE MOTIVATION OF DECISION MAKING The findings described above provide evidence of distinct sources of action control governed by R-O and S-R learning processes. Given the differences in associative structure and in the neural systems controlling these types of learning, it should not be surprising to discover that they are also governed by different motivational processes. Generally, these processes can be differentiated into the influence of the encoded reward-value of the outcome of an action, derived from direct consummatory experience, and the influenced of Pavlovian predictors of reward. Experienced reward determines the performance of goal-directed actions and, hence, reflects the control of actions by outcome values. Where there is a significant degree of stimulus control over action selection, however, it is possible to observe the influence of Pavlovian stimuli associated with reward on performance; ie, stimuli that predict rewarding events can enhance the influence of action selection resulting in an increased tendency to perform selected actions and with increased vigor. As such, this motivational influence is referred to here as that based on Pavlovian values. Neural Basis of Outcome Values It is now well established that the reward processes that establish outcome values depend on the ability of animals to evaluate the affective and motivationally relevant properties of the goal or outcome of goal-directed actions (Balleine, 2001 (Balleine, , 2004;; Dickinson and Balleine, 1994, 2002) . It is one of more striking properties of goal-directed actions that performance is determined by the experienced reward value of the outcomes associated with actions and, unlike habits or other reflexes, is not directly affected by shifts in primary motivation (Dickinson and Balleine, 1994) . For example, rodents do not immediately alter their choice of an action associated with a more (or less) calorific outcome when deprivation is increased (or decreased) and do so only after they have experienced the outcome value in that new deprivation state (Balleine, 1992; Balleine et al, 1995; Balleine and Dickinson, 1994) . The influence of this form of reward or incentive learning on goal-directed actions has been reported following wide ranging shifts in motivational state induced by: (i) specific satiety-induced outcome devaluation (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998b) ; (ii) taste aversion-induced outcome devaluation (Balleine and Dickinson, 1991) ; (iii) shifts from water deprivation to satiety (Lopez et al, 1992) ; (iv) changes in outcome value mediated by drug states and withdrawal (Balleine et al, 1994; Balleine et al, 1995; Hellemans et al, 2006; Hutcheson et al, 2001) ; and, (v) changes in the value of thermoregulatory reward (Hendersen and Graham, 1979) ; and (vi) sexual reward (Everitt and Stacey, 1987; Woodson and Balleine, 2002) (see Balleine, 2001; Balleine, 2004; Balleine, 2005; Dickinson and Balleine, 2002 for reviews) . Current theories suggest, therefore, that outcome values are established by associating the specific sensory features of outcomes with emotional feedback (Balleine, 2001; Dickinson and Balleine, 2002) . Given these theories, one might anticipate that neural structures implicated in associations of this kind would have a critical role in goal-directed action. The amygdala, particularly its baso-lateral region (BLA), has long been argued to mediate sensory-emotional association, and recent research has established the involvement of this area in goal-directed action in rodents. The BLA has itself been heavily implicated in a variety of learning paradigms that have an incentive component (Balleine and Killcross, 2006) ; for example, this structure has long been thought to be critical for fear conditioning and has recently been reported to be involved in a variety of feeding-related effects, including sensory-specific satiety (Malkova et al, 1997) , the control of food-related actions (see below), and in food consumption elicited by stimuli associated with food delivery (Holland et al, 2002; Petrovich et al, 2002) . And, indeed, in several recent series of experiments clear evidence has emerged for the involvement of BLA in incentive learning. In one series, we found that lesions of the BLA rendered the instrumental performance of rats insensitive to outcome devaluation, apparently because they were no longer able to associate the sensory features of the instrumental outcome with its incentive value (Balleine et al, 2003; Corbit and Balleine, 2005) . This suggestion was confirmed using post-training infusions of the protein-synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, after exposure to an outcome after a shift in primary motivation. In this study, evidence was found to suggest that the anisomycin infusion blocked both the consolidation and the reconsolidation of the stimulus--affect association underlying incentive learning (Wang et al, 2005) . More recently, we have found direct evidence for the involvement of an opioid receptor-related process in the basolateral amygdala in encoding outcome value based on sensoryaffect association. In this study, infusion of naloxone into the BLA blocked the assignment of an increase in the value of a sugar solution when it was consumed in an increased state of food deprivation without affecting palatability reactions to the sucrose. Naloxone infused into the ventral pallidum or accumbens shell had the opposite effect, reducing palatability reactions without affecting outcome value (Wassum et al, 2009) . With respect to the encoding of outcome values, the effects of amygdala manipulations on feeding have been found to involve connections between the amygdala and the hypothalamus (Petrovich et al, 2002) and, indeed, it has been reported that neuronal activity in the hypothalamus is primarily modulated by chemical signals associated with food deprivation and food ingestion, including various macronutrients (Levin, 1999; Seeley et al, 1996; Wang et al, 2004; Woods et al, 2000) . Conversely, through its connections with visceral brain stem, midline thalamic nuclei, and associated cortical areas, the hypothalamus is itself in a position to modulate motivational and nascent affective inputs into the amygdala. Together with the findings described above, these inputs, when combined with the amygdala's sensory afferents, provide the basis for a simple feedback circuit linking this sensory information with motivation/affective feedback to determine outcome value. Nevertheless, it is not clear from this structural perspective how changes in outcome value encoded on the basis of this feedback act to influence the selection and initiation of specific courses of action. The BLA projects to a variety of structures in the corticobasal ganglia network implicated in the control of goaldirected action, such as the prelimbic cortex, mediodorsal thalamus, and dorsomedial striaum (see Figure 2b ). However, the role of the BLA and these associated regions in action control differ in important ways (Ostlund and Balleine, 2005; Ostlund and Balleine, 2008) raising the question of how the outcome values established in the BLA make contact with the basal ganglia network critical for goal-directed motor control. Evidence suggests that BLA activity is necessary for encoding outcome values in insular cortex, particularly its gustatory region (Balleine and Dickinson, 2000) , and that these values are then distributed to regions of prefrontal cortex and striatum to control action (Conde ´et al, 1995; Rodgers et al, 2008) . With regard to the latter, insular cortex projects to the ventral striatum, particularly to the core of the nucleus accumbens (NACco) (Brog et al, 1993) and lesions of the NACco have been found (i) to impair instrumental performance (Balleine and Killcross, 1994) and, in contrast to more medial regions, such as the shell and central pole (de Borchgrave et al, 2002 ), (ii) to reduce sensitivity to outcome devaluation (Corbit et al, 2001) . However, these lesions have no effect on the sensitivity of rats to the degradation of the instrumental contingency (Corbit et al, 2001) , suggesting that the NACco influences goal-directed performance, but does not affect goal-directed learning. Generally, therefore, the NACco, as a component of the limbic cortico-basal ganglia network, appears to mediate the ability of the incentive value of rewards to affect instrumental performance, but does not have a direct role in action-outcome learning per se (Balleine and Killcross, 1994; Cardinal et al, 2002; Corbit et al, 2001; de Borchgrave et al, 2002; Parkinson et al, 2000) . Thus, as has long been argued, the NACco appears to have a central role in the translation of motivation into action by bringing changes in outcome value to bear on performance consistent with its description as the limbic-motor interface (Mogenson et al, 1980) . In humans, the evidence on the role of the amygdala in outcome valuation is somewhat ambiguous, although broadly compatible with the aforementioned evidence from the rodent literature. Although some studies have reported amygdala activation in response to the receipt of rewarding outcomes, such as pleasant tastes or monetary reward (Elliott et al, 2003; O'Doherty et al, 2003; O'Doherty et al, 2001a; O'Doherty et al, 2001b) , other studies have suggested that the amygdala is more sensitive to the intensity of a stimulus rather than its value (Anderson et al, 2003; Small et al, 2003) , as amygdala responds equally to both positive and negative valenced stimuli matched for intensity. These latter findings could suggest a more general role for the amygdala in arousal rather than valuation per se, although, alternatively, the findings are also compatible with the possibility that both positive and negative outcome valuation signals are present in the amygdala (correlating both positively and negatively with outcome values, respectively), and that such signals are spatially intermixed at the single neuron level (Paton et al, 2006) . Indeed in a followup fMRI study by Winston et al (2005) , BOLD responses in amygdala were found to be driven best by an interaction between valence and intensity (that is by stimulus of high intensity and with high valence), rather than by one or other dimension alone, suggesting a role for this region in the overall value assigned to an outcome, which would be a product of its intensity (or magnitude) and its valence. Even clearer evidence for the presence of outcome valuation signals has been found in human vmPFC (particularly in medial orbitofrontal cortex) and adjacent central orbitofrontal cortex. Specifically, activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex correlates with the magnitude of monetary outcome received (O 'Doherty et al, 2001a) , and medial along with central orbitofrontal cortex correlates with the pleasantness of the flavor or odor of a food stimulus (Kringelbach et al, 2003; Rolls et al, 2003) . Furthermore, activity in these regions decreases as the hedonic value of that stimulus decreases as subjects are sated on it (Kringelbach et al, 2003; O'Doherty et al, 2000; Small et al, 2003) . De Araujo et al (2003) found that activity in caudal orbitofrontal cortex correlated with the subjective pleasantness of water in thirsty subjects, and, moreover, that insular cortex was active during the receipt of water when subjects were thirsty compared with when they were sated, suggesting the additional possible involvement of at least a part of insular cortex in some features of outcome valuation in humans. Further evidence of a role for medial orbitofrontal cortex in encoding the values of goals has come from a study by Plassmann et al (2007) who used an economic auction mechanism to elicit subjects' subjective monetary valuations for different goal objects, which were pictures of food items one of which subjects would later have the opportunity to consume depending on their assigned valuations. Activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex was found to correlate with subjective valuations for the different food items. Although in this case such value signals are at the time of choice and hence reflect 'goalvalues' rather than outcome values, these findings are consistent with a contribution for this region in encoding the value of goals even if those goals are not currently being experienced (as would be required for a region linking action and outcome representations at the time of choice). Neural Basis of Pavlovian Values In contrast to goal-directed actions, responses controlled by S-R learning are directly affected by shifts in primary motivation. For example, Dickinson et al (1995) found that, when relatively undertrained to lever press for food reward, rats only altered lever-press performance when sated after they had experienced the change in outcome value in that state. In contrast, when overtrained, their performance was reduced directly by satiety suggesting that the vigor of habitual actions is more dependent on the activational effects of motivational state than undertrained actions. In addition, Holland (2004) found that, as overtrained actions became less sensitive to changes in outcome value, they become increasingly sensitive to the effects of Pavlovian reward-related stimuli on response vigor. This dissociation suggests that the influence of outcome values and of Pavlovian values provide distinct sources of motivation for the performance of actions, the former controlling the performance of goal-directed actions and the latter actions that are under significant stimulus control, whether they have simply been trained under discriminative stimuli or have been overtrained and become habitual. Two other behavioral observations support this argument. First, we have found that, when actions are performed in a chain, performance of the most distal action is controlled by the outcome value and not by Pavlovian values, whereas the most proximal action is motivated primarily by Pavlovian values and not by outcome values (Corbit and Balleine, 2003a) . Second, Rescorla (1994) Fand later Holland (2004) Ffound that the influence of a Pavlovian stimulus on lever-press responding was not affected by earlier devaluation of the outcome associated with that stimulus (see also Balleine and Ostlund, 2007d) . Hence, rewardrelated stimuli affect the performance of instrumental actions irrespective of the value of the outcome that the stimulus predicts, an effect consistent with the argument that Pavlovian values exert their effects on actions through stimulus, as opposed to outcome, control. Indeed, this same insensitivity to outcome devaluation has been reported for actions that are acquired and maintained not by primary reward but by stimuli previously associated with reward; ie, so called conditioned reinforcers. Thus, lever pressing trained with a conditioned reinforcer is maintained even when the outcome associated with the stimulus earned by the action has been devalued (Parkinson et al, 2005) . The observation by Rescorla (1994) was particularly important because it provided a very clear demonstration of the fact that, not only the general excitatory influence but also very specific effects of reward-related stimuli on action selection are unaffected by outcome devaluation. This latter, specific effect of stimuli on action selection (an effect referred to as outcome-specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, or simply specific transfer) is demonstrated when two actions trained with different outcomes are performed in the presence of a stimulus paired with one or other of those outcomes; in this situation only the action that earned the same outcome as the stimulus is influenced by that cue. It is also important to note here that we have also recently established evidence of a comparable effect in human subjects. In similar manner to findings in rats, a Pavlovian stimulus associated with a specific outcome (eg, orange juice, chocolate milk, or coca cola) only elevated the performance of actions that earned the outcome predicted by that stimulus and did not affect actions trained with other outcomes (Bray et al, 2008) . There are two important aspects of the neural bases of Pavlovian values to consider relating to (1) the neural bases of predictive learning generally and (2) the neural processes through which predictive learning influences decision making. These are illustrated in Figure 2a and b . With regard to the former, using maniulations of the Pavlovian stimulus-outcome contingency, Ostlund and Balleine (2007b) found that the orbitofrontal cortex in rats has an important role in establishing the predictive validity of Pavlovian cues with regard to specific outcomes. Thus, in control rats, although conditioned responding to a cue declined when its outcome was also delivered unpaired with that cue, responding to a stimulus predicting a different outcome was unaffected. In contrast, rats with lesions of lateral orbitofrontal cortex reduced responding to both stimuli suggesting that these animals were unable to discriminate the relative predictive status of cues with respect to their specific outcomes. Likewise, single-unit recording studies in both rodents and nonhuman primates have implicated neurons in a network of brain regions including the orbitofrontal cortex, and its striatal target area, the ventral striatum, notably the accumbens shell (Fudge and Emiliano, 2003; Haber, 2003) , in encoding stimulus-reward associations. For example, Schoenbaum et al (1998) used a go/no-go reversal task in rats in which, on each trial, one of two different odor cues signaled whether or not a subsequent nose poke by the rat in a food well would result in the delivery of an appetitive sucrose solution or an aversive quinine solution. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex were found to discriminate between cues associated with the positive and negative outcomes, and some were also found to show an anticipatory response related to the expected outcome after the animal had placed its head in the food well, but immediately before the outcome was delivered. Cue-related anticipatory responses have also been found in orbitofrontal cortex relating to the behavioral preference of monkeys for a predicted outcome; ie, the responses of the neurons to the cue paired with a particular outcome depend on the relative preference of the monkey for that outcome compared with another outcome presented in the same block of trials (Tremblay and Schultz, 1999) . Furthermore, bilateral lesions of orbitofrontal cortex, or crossed unilateral lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex in one hemisphere with the amygdala (a region connecting strongly to both the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum (Alheid, 2003; Ongu ¨r and Price, 2000) ) in the other hemisphere, result in impairments in the modulation of conditioned Pavlovian responses following changes in the value of the associated outcome induced by an outcome devaluation procedure in both rats and monkeys (Baxter et al, 2000; Hatfield et al, 1996; Malkova et al, 1997; Ostlund and Balleine, 2007b; Pickens et al, 2003) . Perhaps unsurprisingly given the connectivity between OFC and ventral striatum, activity of some neurons in this region have, similar to those in the orbitofrontal cortex, been found to reflect expected reward in relation to the onset of a stimulus presentation, and to track progression through a task sequence ultimately leading to reward (Cromwell and Schultz, 2003; Day et al, 2006; Shidara et al, 1998) . Some studies report that lesions of a part of the ventral striatum, the nucleus accumbens core can impair learning or expression of Pavlovian approach behavior (Parkinson et al, 1999) , or that infusion of a dopaminergic agonist into accumbens can also impair such learning (Parkinson et al, 2002) , suggesting an important role for ventral striatum in facilitating the production of at least some classes of Pavlovian conditioned associations. Consistent with these findings in rodents and nonhuman primates, functional neuroimaging studies in humans have also revealed activations in both of these areas during both appetitive and aversive Pavlovian conditioning in response to Pavlovian cue presentation. For example, Gottfried et al (2002) reported activity in orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum (as well as the amygdala) following presentation of visual stimuli predictive of the subsequent delivery of both a pleasant and an unpleasant odor. Gottfried et al (2003) aimed at investigating the nature of such predictive representations to establish whether these responses were related to the sensory properties of the unconditioned stimulus irrespective of its underlying reward value, or whether they were directly related to the reward value of the associated unconditioned stimulus. To address this, Gottfried et al (2003) trained subjects to associate visual stimuli with one of two food odors: vanilla and peanut butter while being scanned with fMRI. Subjects were then removed from the scanner and fed to satiety on a food corresponding to one of the food odors to devalue that odor, similar to the devaluation procedures described earlier during studies of instrumental action selection. Following the devaluation procedure, subjects were then placed back in the scanner and presented with the conditioned stimuli again in a further conditioning session. Neural responses to presentation of the stimulus paired with the devalued odor were found to decrease in orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum (and amygdala) from before to after the satiation procedure, whereas no such decrease was evident for the stimulus paired with the non-devalued odor. These results suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum encode both the value of event predicted by a stimulus and not merely its sensory features. Learning Pavlovian Values The finding of expected value signals in the brain raises the question of how such signals are learned in the first place. An influential theory by Rescorla and Wagner (1972) suggests that the learning of Pavlovian predictions is mediated by the degree of surprise engendered when an outcome is presented, or more precisely the difference between what is expected and what is received. Formally this is called a prediction error, which in the Rescorla-Wagner formulation can take on either a positive or negative sign depending on whether an outcome is greater than expected (which would lead to a positive error signal), or less than expected (which would lead to a negative error). This prediction error is then used to update predictions associated with a particular stimulus or cue in the environment, so that if this cue always precedes, for eaxmple, a reward (and hence is fully predictive of reward) eventually the expected value of the cue will converge to the value of the reward, at which point the prediction error is zero and no further learning will take place. Initial evidence for prediction error signals in the brain emerged from the work of Wolfram Schultz and colleagues who observed such signals by recording from the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in awake behaving nonhuman primates undergoing simple Pavlovian or instrumental conditioning tasks with reward (Hollerman and Schultz, 1998; Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1994; Schultz, 1998; Schultz et al, 1997) . These neurons, particularly those present in the ventral tegmental area in the midbrain, project strongly to the ventral corticostriatal circuit, including the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (Oades and Halliday, 1987) . The response profile of these dopamine neurons closely resembles a specific form of prediction error derived from the temporal difference learning rule, in which predictions of future reward are computed at each time interval within a trial, and the error signal is generated by computing the difference in successive predictions (Montague et al, 1996; Schultz et al, 1997) . Similar to the temporal difference prediction error signal, these neurons increase their firing when a reward is presented unexpectedly; decrease their firing from baseline when a reward is unexpectedly omitted; respond initially at the time of the US before learning is established but shift back in time within a trial to respond instead at the time of presentation of the CS once learning has taken place. Further evidence in support of this hypothesis has come from recent studies using fast cyclical voltammetry assays of dopamine release in the ventral striatum during Pavlovian reward conditioning, in which timing of dopamine release in ventral striatum was also found to exhibit a shifting profile, occurring initially at the time of reward presentation but gradually shifting back to occur at the time of presentation of the reward predicting cue (Day and Carelli, 2007) . To test for evidence of a temporal difference prediction error signal in the human brain, O 'Doherty et al (2003) scanned human subjects while they underwent a classical conditioning paradigm in which associations were learned between arbitrary visual fractal stimuli and a pleasant sweet taste reward (glucose). The specific trial history that each subject experienced was next fed into a temporal difference model to generate a time series that specified the modelpredicted prediction error signal that was then regressed against the fMRI data for each individual subject to identify brain regions correlating with the model-predicted time series. This analysis revealed significant correlations with the model-based predictions in a number of brain regions, most notably in the ventral striatum (ventral putamen bilaterally) as well as weaker correlations with this signal in orbitofrontal cortex. Consistent with these findings, numerous other studies have found evidence implicating ventral striatum in encoding prediction errors (Abler et al, 2006; McClure et al, 2003; O'Doherty et al, 2004) . In a recent study by Hare et al (2008) , the role of ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in encoding prediction errors for free rewards was tested against a number of other types of valuation related-signals while subjects performed a simple decision-making task. Activity in ventral striatum was found to correlate specifically with reward prediction errors, whereas activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex was found to correspond more to the valuation of the goal of the decision, perhaps consistent with the aforementioned role for this region in goal-directed learning. The studies discussed above demonstrate that prediction error signals are present during learning of Pavlovian stimulus-reward associations, a finding consistent with the tenets of a prediction error-based account of associative learning. However, merely demonstrating the presence of such signals in either dopamine neurons or in target areas of these neurons, such as the striatum, during learning does not establish whether these signals are causally related to learning or merely an epi-phenomenon. The first study in humans aiming to uncover a causal link was that of Pessiglione et al (2006) who manipulated systemic dopamine levels by delivering a dopamine agonist and antagonist while subjects were being scanned with fMRI during performance of a reward-learning task. Prediction error signals in striatum were boosted following administration of the dopaminergic agonist, and diminished following administration of the dopaminergic antagonist. Moreover, behavioral performance followed the changes in striatal activity and was increased following administration of the dopamine agonist and decreased following administration of the antagonist. These findings support, therefore, a causal link between prediction error activity in striatum and the degree of Pavlovian conditioning. The Influence of Pavlovian Values on Decision Making Over and above the role of ventral striatum in acquiring Pavlovian predictions, this region has also been implicated in the way Pavlovian values alter choice, particularly in studies of Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. In both rodents and humans, however, it appears not to involve the accumbens core directly but the surrounding accumbens shell/ventral putamen region of ventral striatum. In rats, considerable evidence suggests that the amygdala has a role both in Pavlovian conditioning proper (Ostlund and Balleine, 2008) but also in the way that Pavlovian cues influence both the vigor of responses, involving the central nucleus of the amygdala (Hall et al, 2001; Holland and Gallagher, 2003) , and in the way that these cues influence choice, the latter dependent on basolateral amygdala. In one study, Corbit and Balleine (2005) doubly dissociated the influence of cues on choice and on responses vigor; lesions of amygdala central nucleus abolished the increase in vigor induced by these cues without affecting their biasing influence on choice. In contrast, lesions of basolateral amygdala abolished the effect on choice without affecting the increase in vigor. In humans, evidence has emerged linking the degree of activity in the right amygdala across subjects with the extent to which a Pavlovian conditioned cue modulates the vigor of responding (Talmi et al, 2008) . However, as yet, no study has assessed the functions of different amygdalar subnuclei on the motivational control of behavior as has been carried out in rodents. Circuitry involving amygdala has recently been implicated in these effects of Pavlovian values on choice. The basolateral amygdala projects to mediodorsal thalamus (Reardon and Mitrofanis, 2000) , to orbitofrontal cortex, and to both the core and shell regions of the nucleus accumbens (Alheid, 2003) and, in fact lesions of each of these regions appear to influence outcome specific form of Pavlovianinstrumental transfer (Ostlund and Balleine, 2005; Ostlund and Balleine, 2007b; Ostlund and Balleine, 2008) in subtly different ways. Lesions of mediodorsal thalamus and of orbitofrontal cortex have similar effects. When rats were trained on two actions for different outcomes, a stimulus associated with one of the outcomes is usually observed to bias choice and to elevate only the action trained with the outcome predicted by that stimulus. In lesioned rats, however, the stimuli were found to elevate performance indiscriminately; ie, lesioned rats increased their performance but of both actions equally (Ostlund and Balleine, 2007b; Ostlund and Balleine, 2008) . In contrast, lesions of ventral striatum have a very different effect. Although lesions of the accumbens core have been reported to affect the vigor of responses in the presence of Pavlovian cues, Corbit et al (2001) found that these lesions had no effect on the biasing effects on choice performance. Thus, rats with lesions of the accumbens core that were trained on two actions for different outcomes were just as sensitive as sham lesioned rats to the effects of a stimulus associated with one of the two outcomes; ie, similar to shams they increased responding of the action that in training earned the outcome predicted by the stimulus and did not alter performance of the other action. In contrast, lesions of the accumbens shell completely abolished outcome selective Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. Although other evidence suggested that the rats learned both the Pavlovian S-O and instrumental R-O relationships to which they were exposed, the Pavlovian values predicted by the stimuli had no effect on either the vigor of responding or on their choice between actions. In humans, Talmi et al (2008) reported that BOLD activity in the central nucleus accumbens (perhaps analogous to the core region in rodents) was engaged when subjects' were presented with a reward-predicting Pavlovian cue while performing an instrumental response, which led to an increase in the vigor of responding, consistent with the effects of general Pavlovian to instrumental transfer. In a study of outcome-specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer in humans using fMRI, Bray et al (2008) trained subjects on instrumental actions each leading to one of four different unique outcomes. In a separate Pavlovian training session, subjects were previously trained to associate different visual stimuli with the subsequent delivery of one of these outcomes. Specific transfer was then assessed by inviting subjects to choose between pairs of instrumental actions that, in training, were associated with the different outcomes in the presence of a Pavlovian visual cue that predicted with one of those outcomes. Consistent with the effects of specific transfer, subjects were biased in their choice toward the action leading to the outcome consistent with that predicted by the Pavlovian stimulus. In contrast to the region of accumbens activated in the general transfer design of Talmi et al (2008) , specific transfer produced BOLD activity in a region of ventrolateral putamen: this region was less active in trials in which subjects chose the action incompatible with the Pavlovian cue compared with trials in which they chose compatible action, or indeed in other trials in which a Pavlovian stimulus paired with neither outcome was presented. These findings could suggest a role for this ventrolateral putamen region in linking specific outcome-response associations with Pavlovian cues and suggest that on occasions when an incompatible action is chosen, activity in this region may be inhibited. Given the role of this more lateral aspect of the ventral part of the striatum in humans in specific-PIT, it might be tempting to draw parallels between the functions of this area in humans with that of the shell of the accumbens implicated in specific-transfer in rodents. At the moment such suggestions must remain speculative until more fine-grained studies of this effect are conducted in humans, perhaps making use of higher resolution imaging protocols to better differentiate between different ventral striatal (and indeed amygdala) subregions. THE INTEGRATION OF ACTION CONTROL AND MOTIVATION IN DECISION MAKING How learning and motivational processes are integrated to guide performance is a critical issue that has received relatively little attention to date. Some speculative theories have been advanced within the behavioral, computational, and neuroscience literatures, although there is not at present a significant body of experimental results to decide how this integration is achieved. Behavioral Studies Although the fact that both the outcome itself and stimuli that predict that outcome can exert a motivational influence on performance suggests that these processes exert a complimentary influence on action selection, the growing behavioral and neural evidence that these sources of motivation are independent, reviewed above, suggests that the behavioral complementarity of these processes is achieved through an integrative network rather than through a common representational or associative process. This kind of conclusion has in fact long been the source of a number of two-process theories of instrumental conditioning that have been advanced in the behavioral literature. These positions have typically argued for the integration of some form of Pavlovian and instrumental learning process. Although this is not the place to review the variety of theories advanced along these lines (see Balleine and Ostlund, 2007d) , the evidence reviewed above, arguing for distinct learning and motivational processes mediating goal-directed and habitual actions, suggests that this may be based on integration across the S-R and R-O domain in the course of normal performance. Although, this may be achieved in variety of ways, some recent evidence suggests that it is accomplished through a distributed outcome representation involving, on the one hand, the outcome as a goal and on the other the outcome as a stimulus with which actions can become associated. That outcomes might have this kind of dual role is particularly likely in self-paced situations where actions and outcomes occur intermittently, sometimes preceding sometimes following one another over time. Thus, in experiments in which food outcomes are used both as discriminative stimuli and as goals, the delivery of the food can be arranged such that it selects (always precedes) one action and independently serves as an outcome of (always follows) a different action. Devaluation of that outcome was found to influence the action with which it was associated as a goal but did not affect the selection of the action for which the outcome served as a discriminative stimulus (De Wit et al, 2006; Dickinson and de Wit, 2003) . This kind of finding encourages the view that, in the ordinary course of events, stimuli and goals exert complementary control over action selection and initiation, respectively. This position is summarized in Figure 3 . Here, the outcome controls actions in two ways: (1) through a form of S-R association in which the stimulus properties of the outcome can select an action with which they are associated, ie, through an O S -R association; and (2) through the standard R-O association in which any selected action retrieves the outcome as a goal; ie, an R-O G . Thus, given this form of O-R association, anything that retrieves the outcome, such as the Pavlovian S-O association in specific transfer experiments, for example, should act to select the R with which the O is associated (as a stimulus). Selection of that specific R then acts to retrieve the O with which the R is associated for evaluation, now as a goal, allowing the O S and O G to work together to control selection and initiation of the action in performance. That something like this is going on is supported by much of the behavioral evidence already discussed above. Thus, outcome devaluation affects neither the ability of discriminative cues or Pavlovian cues to affect performance and only reduces actions that are dependent on outcome value for initiation (Colwill and Rescorla, 1990; Holland, 2004; Rescorla, 1994) . Likewise, action selection inducted by reinstatement of an action by outcome delivery after a period of extinction is unaffected by devaluation of the outcome, although the rate of subsequent performance is significantly reduced suggesting that the O S selection process is initially engaged normally and the evaluative O G process only later acts to modify the rate of performance (Balleine and Ostlund, 2007d; Ostlund and Balleine, 2007a) . Furthermore, this account provides a very natural explanation of the acquisition of habits and their dependence on overtraining. Thus, if an O S process usually exerts control over action selection, then it requires only the assumption that the strength of this selection process grows sufficiently strong with over training to initiate actions without the need for the evaluation or, more likely, before evaluation is completed. Thus, habitual actions have the quality of being impulsive; they are implemented before the actor has had time adequately to evaluate their consequences. On this view, therefore, the Pavlovian and outcome-related motivational processes associated with habits and actions are intimately related, although their joint influence over the final common path to action. Nevertheless, although these data and this general theoretical approach points to a simple integrative process, it does not provide much in the way of constraints as to how such a process is implemented. Several views of this have, however, been developed in both the computational and neuroscience literatures. Computational Theories of Action Selection A particularly influential class of models for instrumental conditioning has arisen from a subfield of computational theories collectively known as reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) . The core feature of such RL models is that, to choose optimally between different actions, an agent needs to maintain internal representations of the expected reward available on each action, and then subsequently choose the action with the highest expected value. Also central to these algorithms is the notion of a prediction error signal that is used to learn and update expected values for each action through experience, just as was the case for Pavlovian conditioning described earlier. In one such modelFthe actor/critic, action selection is conceived as involving two distinct components: a critic, which learns to predict future reward associated with particular states in the environment, and an actor which chooses specific actions to move the agent from state to state according to a learned policy (Barto, 1992 (Barto, , 1995)) . The critic encodes the value of particular states in the world and as such has the characteristics of a Pavlovian reward prediction signal described above. The actor stores a set of probabilities for each action in each state of the world, and chooses actions according to those probabilities. The goal of the model is to modify the policy stored in the actor, such that, over time, those actions associated with the highest predicted reward are selected more often. This is accomplished by means of the aforementioned prediction error signal that computes the difference in predicted reward as the agent moves from state to state. This signal is then used to update value predictions stored in the critic for each state, but also to update action probabilities stored in the actor such that if the agent moves to a state associated with greater reward (and thus generates a positive prediction error), then the probability of choosing that action in future is increased. Conversely, if the agent moves to a state associated with less reward, this generates a negative prediction error and the probability of choosing that action again is decreased. Analogies have been drawn between the anatomy and connections of the basal ganglia, and possible neural architectures for implementing reinforcement learning models including the actor/critic (Montague et al, 1996) . A key proposal by Montague et al (1996) was that the ventral striatum may have a role as the critic, whereas the dorsal striatum implements the actor. Evidence supporting this conclusion in humans was obtained by O' Doherty et al (2004) who found prediction error signals during performance of an instrumental task but not a Pavlovian task in the dorsal striatum consistent with a role for this region as the actor, while prediction error signals correlated with activity in ventral striatum during both instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning, consistent with the role for this region as the critic. Schonberg et al (2007) subsequently showed that the degree of variance in subjects able to successfully learn an instrumental conditioning task was associated with the extent to which they exhibited prediction errors in dorsal striatum. Furthermore, consistent with the actor/critic proposal, while reward-prediction error activity in ventral striatum was weaker in subjects who failed to learn such a task this ventral striatum prediction error activity did not differ significantly between groups. These results suggest a dorsal/ventral distinction within the striatum, whereas ventral striatum is more concerned with Pavlovian or stimulus-outcome learning, the dorsal stria-tum is more engaged during the learning of S-R or S-Routcome associations. How does a model such as the actor/critic map onto the distinction between goal-directed and habitual rewardpredictions described earlier? One possibility, proposed by Daw et al (2005) , is that a reinforcement learning model such as the actor/critic is concerned purely with the learning of habitual S-R value signals (see also Balleine et al, 2008) . According to this interpretation, action-value signals learned by an actor/critic would not be immediately updated following a change in the value of the reward outcome (such as by devaluation). Instead such an update would occur only after the model re-experiences the reward in its now devalued state and generates prediction errors that would incrementally modulate action values. Daw et al (2005) also proposed an alternative model to the actor/critic to account for the goal-directed component of instrumental learning: a forward model. Unlike reinforcement learning which develops approximate or 'cached' values for particular actions based on earlier experience with those actions, in the 'forward model', values for different actions are worked out on-line by taking into account knowledge about the rewards available in each state, and the transition probabilities between each state and iteratively working out the value of each available option. One property of this model is that value representations should be sensitive to outcome devaluation, because they are computed on-line with respect to the known structure of the decision problem and the incentive value of the outcome; hence, this model accounts for one property of goal-directed learning, namely the sensitivity of goal-directed actions to changes in outcome value. Furthermore, the extent to which the goaldirected 'forward-model' and the habitual RL system controls behavior is argued to depend on an on-going uncertainty-based competition between the two systems so that the system yielding the least uncertain estimates of reward controls behavior at a given point in time, a feature that can be shown to reproduce the differential control of behavior by the goal-directed system early compared with late in training. Some fMRI evidence in support of the existence of 'forward' model-based value signals in vmPFC has emerged (Hampton et al, 2006) . However, although this is a very promising conceptual framework, a number of outstanding issues still need to be resolved. First, although there are several ways of understanding the uncertainty that shifts between goal-directed and habitual control, these appear, nevertheless, to be axiomatically competing processes. Hence, the notion they might at times operate cooperatively is not yet accommodated in this analysis. Second, although it provides an elegant account of the differential sensitivity of under-and overtrained actions to outcome devaluation, it does not, as of yet, account for their differential sensitivity to contingency degradation. Third, a strong implication of this model is that the computational function of dopamine relates specifically to the operation of the habit-like RL system, and not the goal-directed system. Yet, dopaminergic neurons project heavily to the prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatal regions involved in goal-directed behavior as well as to dorsolateral striatum (Gaspar et al, 1992; Lidow et al, 1991; Lynd-Balta and Haber, 1994 ). Thus, it seems possible that dopamine has a role in the goaldirected system as well as in the habitual system. Finally, empirical evidence in support of the presence of distinct RL and forward model-based value signals has not yet been forthcoming. An alternative model of reward-based action selection has been proposed by Frank and Claus (2006) . This model provides a literal description of proposed cortico-basal ganglia circuits underlying reward-learning, in which different groups of striatal neurons are proposed to mediate 'go' and 'no-go' responses, learned through the afferent dopaminergic prediction error. In essence this model is a literal implementation of a habit-like reinforcement learning process. The prefrontal cortex is proposed to maintain outcome information during action selection in a working memory, which is used to exert biasing effects on basal ganglia circuitry. The transfer of behavior from goaldirected to habitual control is proposed to take place through the strengthening of habit-like S-R associations in the basal ganglia which overcomes the biasing effects of the prefrontal system. Although this is a promising approach for testing how such dual control processes could be implemented within the architecture of the corticostriatal network, extensions to the current model are required to accommodate all of the known behavioral and neuroanatomical properties of the two systems reviewed earlier, such as the differential sensitivity of these systems to contingency degradation and the differentiation of the striatum into medial (goal-directed) and lateral (habitual) components. Neural Theories of Action Selection Recent developments in the neuroanatomy and neuropharmacology of the basal ganglia have spawned a series of theoretical propositions regarding how learning and motivational processes might be integrated within this system. For example, one attractive proposal is that the various ventral and dorsal striatal networks described above, and illustrated in Figure 2a , are hierarchically organized, allowing information to propagate from one level to the next. In particular, the recent description of spiraling connections between the striatum and the midbrain suggest an anatomical organization that can potentially implement interactions between networks (see Figure 2b ). As observed by Haber et al (2000) , striatal neurons send direct inhibitory projections to DA neurons from which they receive reciprocal DA projections, and also project to DA neurons which in turn project to a different striatal area. These latter projections allow feed-forward propagation of information in only one direction, from the limbic networks to associative and sensorimotor networks. On this view, for example, Pavlovian values could influence the effective Pavlovian teaching signal at one level, while enhancing dopaminergic activity, and hence instrumental performance at the next. This could be revealed in a negative feedback signal from the GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons from the striatum to the DA neurons on the one hand, and the potentiation of the DA signal through disinhibitory projections on the neighboring cortico-basal ganglia network (eg, through GABAergic striatal projection neurons to nigral GABAergic interneurons to DA neurons) (Haber, 2003; Haber et al, 2000; Yin et al, 2008) . This model predicts the progressive involvement of different neural networks during different stages of learning, a suggestion that has received some support (Belin and Everitt, 2008; Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Jueptner et al, 1997b; Miyachi et al, 2002; Miyachi et al, 1997) . Various kinds of evidence support this model; for example, although the feedforward projections from ventral striatum to the DA neurons projecting to ventral striatum (Nauta et al, 1978; Nauta, 1989) is relatively greater than the feedback projections to ventral striatum, the opposite is true of the dorsal striatum. As such, the ventral striatal network should be expected to exert greater control over the functions of the dorsal striatum than vice versa. There is in fact some evidence for this prediction; the Pavlovian facilitation of instrumental behavior is greater than the reverse; indeed, evidence suggests that the instrumental actions tend to inhibit, rather than excite, Pavlovian CRs (Ellison and Konorski, 1964; Williams, 1965) . As might be expected, therefore, evidence from Pavlovian instrumental transfer experiments is consistent with this model. Thus, for example, dopamine activity appears to be critical for general transfer, which is abolished by DA antagonists and local inactivation of the VTA (Dickinson et al, 2000; Murschall and Hauber, 2006) , whereas amphetamine-induced sensitization can enhance it (Wyvell and Berridge, 2000) . Nevertheless, evidence from specific transfer is more ambiguous; it is partially spared after inactivation of the VTA (Corbit et al, 2007) , rendered nonselective by inactivation of dorsomedial striatum and abolished by inactivation of the dorsolateral striatum (Corbit and Janak, 2007) , suggesting that stimulus control over action selection might be specific to the nigrostriatal projection. Thus, based on these results, the dorsomedial area appears to influence only the specificity of transfer-specific transfer, whereas the DLS could be necessary for any increases in response vigor induced by Pavlovian values. It is possible to speculate too on the way this model might be thought to account for the influence of outcome values on performance. For example, evidence described above suggests that lesions of accumbens core reduce instrumental performance and also reduce sensitivity to outcome devaluation (Balleine and Killcross, 1994; Corbit et al, 2001) . Given the role of basolateral amygdala in outcome values and its inputs to accumbens core, there exists at least the possibility that the influence of outcome values on performance is mediated by an amygdala-ventral striatal modulation of the excitatory dopaminergic afferents on dorsomedial striatum from the substantia nigra. Never-theless, this general confluence of motivational processes through a common dopaminergic mechanism, although parsimonious, does not fit with the growing body of evidence demonstrating that the effects of outcome and Pavlovian values on performance are doubly dissociable (reviewed above). There are, of course, other networks that have been implicated in the way outcome values influence performance. First and foremost among these are the direct projections of basolateral amygdala to medial prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum (Kelley et al, 1982) . But, of course, there are many other possible routes through which these structures might interact including projections to prefrontal cortex from the ventral striato-pallido-thalamic pathway (Zahm, 2000) , and, indeed, directly into dorsal striatum through the thalamo-striatal pathway generally (Groenewegen et al, 1999; Haber and McFarland, 2001; Zackheim and Abercrombie, 2005) . Over and above this question of the integration of learning and motivational processes in performance, there is also the question of whether the corticostriatal networks that mediate R-O and S-R learning interact directly. As described above, some evidence suggests that they form a cooperative network. However, there is also evidence of inhibitory or competing interactions between these processes; thus, inactivation of dorsomedial striatum immediately places actions under habitual control (Yin et al, 2005) , whereas inactivation of the dorsolateral striatum immediately renders actions goal-directed (Yin et al, 2006) as if these two processes are always active and merely compete for control of performance (Balleine et al, 2009) . The generally accepted architecture of the basal ganglia emphasizes the operation of functionally distinct, closed parallel loops connecting prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and the pallidum/substantial nigra, and thalamus that feeds back onto the originating area of prefrontal cortex (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990a; Alexander et al, 1986; Nakahara et al, 2001) . There is, on this view, integration within loops but not vertical integration across loops and, as a consequence, various theories have had to be developed to account for vertical integration; eg, the split loop (Joel and Weiner, 2000) or spiraling midbrain-striatal integration described above (Haber, 2003; Haruno and Kawato, 2006) . In contrast, older theories of striato-pallido-nigral integration proposed that, rather than being discrete, corticostriatal connections converge onto common target regions, particularly in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, a view that allows naturally for integration between various corticostriatal circuits (Bar-Gad et al, 2003; Percheron and Filion, 1991; Yelnik, 2002) . Although anatomical studies challenge this view, recent evidence has emerged supporting a hybrid version; that, in addition to the segregated loops, there may also be integration through collateral projections from caudate (or dorsomedial striatum) converging with projections from the putamen (or dorsolateral striatum) onto common target regions in both the internal and external globus pallidus (Nadjar et al, 2006; Sadek et al, 2007) . Whether these converging projections underlie the integration of the O S -R and R-O G associations identified above remains to be established. However, the processes mediating goal-directed and habitual actions interact, recent data suggest that the basal ganglia are able to maintain these functions in parallel and allow, under some conditions, one or other process either independent control or, under other conditions, both processes to exert cooperative control over choice and decision making. It is important to note that, in suggesting that two distinct learning processes are concurrently engaged, this view implies that the representation of the instrumental outcome has two distinct functions serving both as a reward or outcome, as a part of the actionoutcome association underlying goal-directed learning, and also to reinforce an association between the action and antecedent stimuli in habits. How this is achieved is not fully understood, although some evidence suggests that the function of parsing the outcome into both a reward and a reinforcement signal depends on the amygdala (Balleine, 2005 (Balleine, , 2009;; Balleine and Killcross, 2006; Balleine and Ostlund, 2007d ). As described above, considerable evidence has accumulated suggesting that the basolateral amygdala has a central role in encoding the incentive or reward value of the instrumental outcome and, hence, in controlling the performance of goal-directed actions based on the interaction of this evaluative process with the action-outcome association (see section 'The corticolimbic-ventral striatal network and the motivation of decision-making'). Likewise, a number of authors have suggested that the reinforcement signal mediating the acquisition of S-R associations involving the dorsolateral striatum involves the ascending dopaminergic projection arising in the substantia nigra (Faure et al, 2005; Reynolds et al, 2001) , a projection that appears to be at least partly controlled by the central nucleus of the amygdalaFsee Figure 2b (Gonzales and Chesselet, 1990) . Although direct evidence that the CeN has a role in this reinforcement signal (and so in habit formation) has not yet been reported, it is known to be involved in generating general affective responses to rewarding events (Cardinal et al, 2002) , signals associated with rewarding events (Corbit and Balleine, 2005; Holland and Gallagher, 2003) , and in the control of simple S-R associations, such as those involving the performance of orienting responses to stimuli associated with food (El-Amamy and Holland, 2007) . By activating both the central and basolateral amygdala, therefore, a single outcome-related event could potentially exert distinct functional effects in the performance of actions in the decision-making situation by controlling the production of independent reward and reinforcement signals that concatenate to distinct regions of striatum to control distinct corticostriatal circuits. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Although there are numerous unanswered questions, we have shown here that there is likely to be a great deal of commonality in the way the cortico-basal ganglia network functions to control adaptive behavior in mammalian species. Thus, we have described here two learning processes and two motivational processes that subserve goal-directed and habitual actions and that not only appear to exert similar behavioral control but also to depend on homologous neural networks in humans and rodents. Of course, we are not proposing that these networks are identical or reducible on a point-to-point basis. It does appear, however, that the functional anatomy and underlying organizational principles of the basal ganglia in humans and rodents are extremely similar and it will be an important task of future research to establish whether and in what ways they differ functionally. There is, for example, striking similarity in the functional network controlling goal-directed actions. As we describe above, objective and subjective measures of action-outcome learning correlate with activity in regions of medial prefrontal, medial orbital cortex, and the caudate nucleus in humans (Figure 1 ). Similarly, we reviewed the now considerable evidence that prelimbic cortex and dorsomedial striatum in rats subserves a very similar function. Generally, the homology between the rodent dorsomedial striatum and human caudate nucleus is relatively secure, although there are clearly functional differences in the rostro-caudal plane that remain to be explored (Balleine et al, 2007b) . There has, however, been considerably more controversy as to whether the rat possesses similar prefrontal cortical regions to humans and other primates (Preuss, 1995) . Nevertheless, this controversy has largely been concerned with narrower issues such as whether there is a rodent homology to primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (with Preuss (1995) claiming that there is not and Uylings et al, 2003 arguing that there certainly is) or frontal pole (Wise, 2008) , whereas there is growing evidence based on connectivity and density of connections, neurotransmitter types, embryological development, cytoarchitectonic characteristics, and (last but, obviously, not least from, our perspective) functional similarity that rodent prelimbicmedial orbital cortex region is analogous to human ventromedial prefrontal-medial orbital cortex (see Brown and Bowman, 2002; Uylings et al, 2003 for discussion) . Generally, however, there has been insufficient systematic research of prefrontal cortex functions in rodent and human subjects using similarly structured tasks. More research along these lines would contribute meaningfully to an understanding of functional homologies in prefrontal cortex. We also describe commonalities in the network mediating habit learning. Although, given the literature, this is perhaps somewhat less surprising (Graybiel, 2008) , it is important to recognize that much of the previous evidence has not only come from very different tasks but also the relevance of these tasks to S-R learning has often largely been inferred from the experimenters' description of the task rather than direct tests of the factors controlling performance. There has, for example, been a large literature linking sensorimotor cortex and its efferents to dorsolateral striatum in rat in various maze learning tasks and other nominally S-R tasks involving discrimination learning. As we describe above, this is, however, something that has now been confirmed more directly using behavioral measures that confirm habitual control of overtrained actions both in rats and, using a very similar task, in humans and found to depend on dorsolateral striatum in rat and on the analogous region of striatum, the putamen, in human. At present, little is known about the structure of habit learning. For example, although reinforcement learning models provide clear predictions on the nature of the reinforcement signal supporting habit learning, it is not currently known if this constitutes the dopamine error signal alone, some integral of that signal involving local neuromodulators of the dopaminergic input to the striatum, or some combination of these or other potential processes. Likewise, although we have argued that amygdala has a central role in both reward and reinforcement processes, we do not know how these twin functions of outcome delivery are parsed neurally. Although the goal-directed and habit learning processes that support the two major forms of adaptive behavioral control can be observed in both humans and rats and appear to depend on homologous corticostriatal circuits, it is unknown how these forms of learning interact and what conditions modulate whether they cooperate or inhibit/ interfere with one another. As presented above, it is clear that under some circumstances they interact; goal-directed and habitual control of performance often appears to be all or none rather than some mixture of the two. In other situations, these processes appear to be temporally related to one another and to function in synergy during the selection, evaluation, and implementation of actions. This will be a critical problem to resolve if we are to formulate accurate models of real life decision making in the course of which ongoing routine actions have often to be suspended, interference between concurrent choices has to be overcome, and new information has to be incorporated into the decision process while, nevertheless, remaining adaptive, at least for the most part. Finally, we also described considerable evidence suggesting that homologous structures in rat and human mediate the influence of motivational processes on the performance of goal-directed and habitual actions, particularly the influence of Pavlovian cues on choice. Central and lateral OFC and ventral striatum appear to be particularly important for calculating and deploying the influence of Pavlovian values and, as described above, similar structures have also been implicated in rats in this process. This is perhaps most clear in the influence of outcome-specific Pavlovian values on choice in Pavlovian-instrumental transfer; in rodent, this effect depends on a circuit involving accumbens shell, mediodorsal thalamus, and lateral obitofrontal cortex. In humans, to date we have found evidence that the ventral putamen, a region coextensive with the shell, is activated in the presence of cues predicting the same outcome as the action when that action is performed, and is reduced when an action associated with a different outcome is performed. Similarly, outcome values encoded as a consequence of exposure to, and consummatory contact with, the consequences of actions have been found to depend on amygdala, insular, and medial orbitofrontal cortex in humans and to rely on similar structures in rats. Unfortunately, apart from very few notable exceptions, little of this research has been undertaken using comparable tasks or motivational manipulations organized to influence the same or comparable regulatory systems. Again, it is clearly research along these lines that will make the most rapid progress in understanding functional homologies in motivation. Finally, we do not have a clear understanding of the way that motivational and emotional processes regulate the networks that control choice and decision making in either humans or rodents. The common features of the influence of outcome and Pavlovian values on choice in rodent and human subjects described above points to the fact that similar neural systems organized along similar lines likely underlie this integrative process at least in mammals but, for the moment, it would be pure speculation to attempt to specify those in any greater detail.

(b) Region of human vmPFC (here medial OFC) exhibiting a response profile consistent with the goal-directed system. Activity in this region during action selection for a liquid food reward was sensitive to the current incentive value of the outcome, decreasing in activity during the selection of an action leading to a food reward devalued through selective satiation compared to an action leading to a non-devalued food reward. From Valentin et al (2007) . (c) Regions of human vmPFC (medial prefrontal cortex and medial OFC) exhibiting sensitivity to instrumental contingency and thereby exhibiting response properties consistent with the goal-directed system. Activation plots show areas with increased activity during sessions with a high contingency between responses and rewards compared with sessions with low contingency. From Tanaka et al (2008) . (d) Photo-micrographs of NMDA-induced cell-body lesions of dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum (right hemisphere) with the approximate region of lesion-induced damage illustrated in using red and purple circles, respectively (left hemisphere). This lesion of dorsomedial striatum has been found to abolish acquisition and retention of goal-directed learning (cf. Yin et al, 2005) , whereas this lesion of dorsolateral striatum was found to abolish the acquisition of habit learning (Yin et al, 2004) . (e) Region of human anterior dorsomedial striatum exhibiting sensitivity to instrumental contingency from the same study described in panel c. (f) Region of posterior lateral striatum (posterior putamen) exhibiting a response profile consistent with the behavioral development of habits in humans.From Tricomi et al, 2009. Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2. (a) Evidence reviewed in text suggests that distinct neural networks mediate the acquisition of goal-directed actions and habits and the role of goal values and of Pavlovian values in the motivation of performance. On this view, habits are encoded in a network involving sensory-motor (SM) cortical inputs to dorsolateral striatum (DL), with feedback to cortex through substantial nigra reticulata/internal segment of the globus pallidus (SNr/GPi) and posterior thalamus (PO) and are motivated by midbrain dopaminergic inputs from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). A parallel circuit linking medial prefrontal cortex (MPC), dorsomedial striatum (DM), SNr, and mediodorsal thalamus (MD) mediates goal-directed actions that may speculatively involve a dopamine-mediated reward process. Finally, choice between actions can be facilitated both by the value of the goal or outcome associated with an action, likely involving amygdala inputs to ventral striatum, MPC and DM, and by Pavlovian values mediated by a parallel ventral circuit mediated by orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatal (VS) inputs into the habit and goal-directed loops. (b) Various theories have been advanced, based on rat and primate data, regarding how limbic, cortical, and midbrain structures interact with the striatum to control performance (see text).Here, dopaminergic (DA) feedforward and feedback processes are illustrated involving VTA-accumbens shell and core and SNc-dorsal striatal networks. The involvement of the BLA in reward processes is illustrated, as is the hypothesized involvement of the inframbic cortex (IL) and central nucleus of the amygdala in the reinforcement signal derived from SNc afferents on dorsolateral stiatum. Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3. Associations that current evidence suggests are formed between various stimuli (S), actions (R), and outcomes (O) or goals (G) and goal values (V) during the course of acquisition or performance of goal-directed action. (i) Current research provides evidence for both R-O G and O S -R associations in the control of performance. Whereas the O S -R association does not directly engage or influence changes in outcome value, the R-O G association directly activates an evaluative process (V). Performance (R E ) relies on both R-O and O-R processes. The necessity of the evaluative pathway in response initiation can be overcome by increasing the contribution of the selection process either by presenting a stimulus separately trained with the outcome (ie, S CS -O S as in Pavlovian-instrumental transfer experiments) or by strengthening the O S -R association itself by selective reinforcement through overtraining. ..............................................................................................................................................Neuropsychopharmacology REVIEWS ...............................................................................................................................................................

Introduction A hungry guest's stomach rumbles at the sound of a dinner bell; a child extends her hand for a piece of candy. Both sensory cues and the initiation of actions can become associated with expectations about future outcomes. There are two broad conceptualizations of how associations between actions, events, and their resultant outcomes are formed. The first is a gradual strengthening of an association between an action or a stimulus and a reliable outcome -often described as Hebbian learning 1 . The second is a gradual reduction in errors of prediction through comparison of expected and observed outcomes -often a critical component of reinforcement learning 2 . In a well-known example of such a representation, the activity of mammalian midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons correlates with changes in reward expectation -or reward prediction errors (RPEs) -following associative learning 3 . This has provided direct evidence in support of the notion that reinforcement learning proceeds via a progressive reduction in error that is represented in the RPE correlates of mDA neurons. RPE correlates have been observed in mDA neurons almost exclusively within a specific experimental condition: well-trained animals learning new associations through the introduction of new cues or altered contingencies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Behavioral performance and mDA reward signals can adapt to these new contingencies within tens of trials in rodents 11 and monkeys 4, 5 . However, it has also been observed that mDA neuron correlates can lag adaptive changes in behavior 5, 7 , calling into question the causal role of RPE correlates in the learning of associations. Additionally, even in the well-studied overtrained condition the circuit mechanisms by which reward prediction errors are computed remains unclear 12 . This could be due, at least in part, to the tight coordination of multiple learning systems characteristic of the trained state 13, 14 . In sharp contrast to the rapid adaptation to changed contingencies in trained animals, for naive animals learning a novel association many hundreds of trials can be required to observe stable or asymptotic behavior -especially for trace conditioning paradigms. These more gradual adaptive changes in behavior allow for more observations of inherently probabilistic neural activity and behavior. Influential models of the RPE computation make quantitative predictions about the emergence of RPE correlates reflected in mDA neuron activity during such novel learning 3, 15 . However, to date, empirical data to quantitatively compare to these predictions is lacking. Moreover, whereas novel learning requires intact mDA signaling 16 , necessity has not been demonstrated for many aspects of adaptive changes in behavior following extensive training. Thus, we reasoned that observing the dynamics with which mDA neuron activity changes over training could provide important constraints on possible circuit mechanisms underlying RPE correlates. Here we examine movement-related mDA activity as naïve (but habituated) mice are first trained in a Pavlovian trace-conditioning paradigm. We use optogenetic identification to unambiguously identify mDA neurons from two major midbrain populations in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). By studying the initial mDA response in naive animals through to responses to self-initiated movements, sweetened water rewards, and sensory cues in well trained mice we detail the time courses with which each correlate emerges. We replicate the observation that RPE correlates become apparent in both VTA and SNc mDA neurons only after learning. We find that this late emergence is due to that fact that RPE correlates are a consequence of temporal integration of independent reward expectation signals associated with reward-predictive sensory cues and initiation of appetitive actions. Results Adult transgenic mice expressing a light-activated opsin, channelrhodopsin-2 17 (Chr2), in mDA neurons were exposed to a trace conditioning paradigm in which a 0.5 sec long auditory tone was presented 1.5 sec before delivery of a sweetened water reward (Fig. 1a-b ; see Methods). We chose to use a head fixed paradigm 18 as in canonical studies on representations in mDA neurons 3, 19 and for the desirable reduction in variability of behavior. While no action was necessary to receive water, anticipation of available water is often accompanied by body movements (readily observed in freely moving animals) not typically assessed in head-fixed subjects. To enable such measurement, we supported mice in a spring-suspended basket equipped with an accelerometer (Fig. 1a , see Methods). Body movements were correlated with, but not synonymous with, bouts of licking (Fig. 1b )confirming that body movement can provide an additional metric to track learned behaviors in head-fixed mice. Learning was characterized by the emergence of conditioned changes in behavior both to the delivery of water and to the presentation of the tone. With increasing experience mice exhibited increasingly rapid reactions to presence of available water (Fig. 1c ). The mean reaction time to collect the water was monotonically reduced from hundreds of milliseconds in naïve animals to a latency of ~60 ms (~1/2 licking cycle) after ~1000 trials with water delivery. This decrease in the latency to collect available water was correlated with a monotonic increase in the number of licks at the water spout during the delay between tone offset and water delivery steadily increased (Fig. 1c-d ; latency to initiate licking following tone, r = -0.50, p < 0.0001; licks in the CR during tone-reward interval, r = 0.63, p < 0.0001). In addition, body movements became increasingly stereotyped and reliable (Fig. 1c ; relative difference in basket displacement in response to the tone and reward, r = -0.43, p < 0.0001). Whereas mice overtrained on this same paradigm rapidly re-acquire and extinguish responses to the tone 7 , naïve learning is characterized by a rapid emergence of learned behavior (~3 sessions; ~100 trials/session) and a gradual asymptotic stabilization of multiple aspects of learned behavior (decreased latency to collect water, increased anticipatory licking and stereotyped body movements). Given this examination of behavior during the first ~1000 trials of training we next explored how responses to mDA neurons emerge over this same period. We obtained cell-attached electrophysiological recordings (Fig. 1e-h ; see Methods) from optogenetically-identified ('optotagged' 20, 21 ) mDA neurons in the VTA (n =47) and SNc (n =88) of naïve mice as they learned an auditory trace conditioning paradigm. Localization of the SNc or VTA on each penetration was determined by observing the magnitude of an optogenetically-evoked field potential (Fig. 1g ) known to reflect the presence of mDA neurons 22 . Cell-attached, loose-seal recordings were obtained in the region of the largest evoked potential (Fig. 1f-g ) and mDA neuron identity was confirmed by optically driving trains and bursts of action potentials (Fig. 1g ). The range of depths over which evoked potentials and positively identified mDA neurons were found agreed well with the anatomy of the VTA and SNc (Fig. 1h ). Moreover, identified mDA neurons had properties that agreed with canonical electrophysiological criteria and post-hoc confirmation of high penetrance labelling of mDA neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1a-b ). Phasic modulation of mDA activity at initiation of body movements and licking Recent studies have found that activity in at least some populations of mDA neurons correlates to movement initiation in naive or untrained animals [23] [24] [25] . In trained animals, DA release in ventral striatum can correlate with initiation of reward-related actions 26, 27 . Thus, we first examined activity in naïve animals acclimated to the head-fixed context, but prior to receiving any rewards in that context. In the absence of informative stimuli or expectation of water rewards, we observed significant inhibition in 10 of 12 mDA neurons from SNc and 9 of 17 in VTA upon initiation of body movement. Only one mDA neuron in VTA and none in SNc exhibited significant excitation (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, modulation window vs baseline, see Methods; Fig. 2a ). Reports of excitatory peri-movement responses in mDA neurons 23, 25 led us to more carefully examine activity around the time of movement initiation. We measured the interspike interval (ISI) just before movement-related pauses in activity (see Methods). This analysis revealed an apparent "covert" excitation in the form of a spike phase advance present in mDA neurons from both SNc and VTA (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b ). Thus, mDA neurons are modulated by a sequence of (covert) excitation followed by a more dominant inhibition prior to movement initiation in mice acclimated to headfixation. Given evidence for more prominent positive modulation around purposive action initiation in rodents 2827, 29, 30 and primates 31 , we next examined whether weak excitation in naïve mice might be altered by the presence of available water rewards. Following the introduction of mice to auditory trace conditioning we again examined peri-movement mDA neuron activity. We first considered movement bouts initiated during the long intertrial intervals that were well separated from either auditory cues or water delivery. Such self-initiated movements occurred within the intertrial intervals in bouts (bout length: 3.9 ± 1.5 s) separated by periods of stillness (interbout interval: 6.4 ± 1.9 s). Around half (57 ± 5%) of self-initiated movement bouts were accompanied by licking. In contrast to the net inhibition of mDA neuron activity in the naive context, in a rewarded context we observed more significant excitation of individual mDA neurons just prior to self-initiated movement onset (23 out of 96 during training vs 1 out of 29 pre-reward training, p = 0.01, SNc: 19 of 66 during training vs 0 of 12 pre-training, p = 0.03; VTA: 4 of 30 during training vs 1 of 17 pretraining, p = 0.6, Fig. 2b, c ). Thus, SNc DA neurons were more likely to be excited at movement initiation than VTA DA neurons although significant excitation was observed from individual neurons in both populations. As in naïve animals, net inhibition at movement initiation was still common in both mDA neuron subpopulations (SNc: 34 of 66, VTA: 17 of 30) and appeared to be unchanged in its magnitude (Fig. 2c ). Also similar to naïve animals, covert excitation was present in non-"excited" neurons in the form of a spike phase advance just prior to movement-related pauses (Supplementary Fig. 2c ). Together these results suggest a majority of mDA neurons receive both excitation and inhibition upon movement initiation; however, excitation can be enhanced by the presence of rewards, while inhibition is not. We next examined within-trial modulation of mDA neuron activity as naïve mice first began to consume water rewards in our training context (sessions 1-3; n=22 mDA neurons; n=6 mice). Consistent with activity around self-initiated movements, we found that modulation of mDA activity after water delivery appeared to be associated with the initiation of consumptive licking (Fig. 3 ). This was particularly apparent in mDA neurons recorded in mice with variable latencies to initiate consumption (Fig. 3a ). On average, mDA activity peaked prior to the first contact of the tongue to the water port (Fig. 3b-c ), indicating that activity was related to movement initiation rather than sensation of the water. In trained animals, mDA neurons have a highly characteristic latency of response to auditory sensory cues -around 50ms onset, 85ms peak 7 . However, early in training we observed little specific modulation of mDA activity until ~150 ms after water delivery (Fig. 3a, d ). This suggests that the audible solenoid valve did not provoke a robust sensory or "salience" response in mDA neurons. As training progressed a large additional component of the mDA reward response emerged that was time-locked to reward delivery (within the first 150 ms post-reward, p = 0.0002 trials 1-300 vs trials 301-900; 151-400 ms post-reward, p = 0.6, Fig. 3d ). Also consistent with the lack of a strong sensory component to mDA activity at this early stage of learning, we observed no response to the louder auditory cue (audible tone: 70 dB; solenoid valve: 52dB; background noise: 55 dB; see Fig. 4 ) and none of our stimuli reached the intensities previously reported to produce salience responses (~90 dB 3, 32 ). If it is the case that the modulation of mDA activity after reward delivery does not have a significant sensory component early in training, we reasoned that substantially reducing a salient sensory component of water delivery -activation of the solenoid valve -would not diminish the mDA response. Thus, we recorded mDA neurons in a subset of animals using a silent solenoid that was undetectable across the ultrasonic frequency range (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). The phasic modulation of mDA neuron activity with an undetectable solenoid remained similarly well aligned to the initiation of consumptive licking (Fig. 3e ). Notably, in primary thirst and hunger centers in the rodent brain, even in naïve animals, modulation of activity can be predictive of consumption rather than a reflection of physical, sensorial contact with water 33, 34 . Our data thus suggest that a movement initiation-associated phasic excitation-inhibition sequence is the earliest reward-related modulation of activity in SNc and VTA mDA neuron populations during novel learning. Emergence of sensory cue-related activity in mDA neurons during early learning We next sought to characterize the emergence of sensory cue-related activity of mDA neurons over early learning. Consistent with a large body of prior work 3 , mDA neurons lacked a coherent response to the auditory cue early in learning, but developed a robust, monotonically increasing phasic response with training (r = 0.32, p = 0.002, n = 96, Fig. 4ac ). Surprisingly, the proportion of mDA neurons with a robust phasic response at the time of water delivery also increased over the first three sessions (1-3 sessions: 10 of 22, 4-8 sessions: 38 of 43, 9+ sessions: 27 of 31. p < 0.001; Fig. 3d ). In contrast to responses to the auditory cue, response amplitude at the time of water delivery was not significantly correlated with the number of trials experienced (r = -0.06, p=0.6, n = 96; Fig. 4c ). The inference from existing data and influential models is that mDA neuron activity should directly "transfer" from a reward to an earlier, predictive stimulus 6, 8, 15, 19, [35] [36] [37] . By contrast, our data -the first to examine the time course of the emerging mDA response to a predictive cue in naïve animals -suggest that mDA responses to the predictive cue and the reward do not exhibit the predicted, negative trial-by-trial correlation 15, 36 . Rather, auditory cue and water delivery responses had a small but significant positive correlation in individual mDA neurons across training (r = 0.26, p = 0.01, n = 96; Fig. 4d ). We finally examined the relationship of cue and reward signals on a trial-by-trial basis selectively within neurons that had significant sensory cue-related responses. Only 6 of 75 such neurons exhibited significant correlations between auditory cue and reward responses, and they were positive (Fig. 4e ). mDA responses to predictive sensory cues and water delivery thus appear to emerge independently while being scaled by a common cell-specific factor 32, 38 (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). We have described two apparently independent components of the phasic responses of mDA neurons: a movement-related excitatory-inhibitory sequence (Fig. 2, 3 ) and a phasic excitation associated with sensory stimuli that emerges as mice begin to exhibit learned behavior (Fig. 3d, 4a-c ). In the sensory cue-related component, excitation is specifically enhanced as a function of the extent of learning (Fig. 3d, 4c ). For the movement initiationrelated component, excitation was pronounced once water rewards were first available even for self-initiated movements in the absence of cues or water rewards. Movement-initiation related activity of mDA neurons reflects reward expectation mDA movement-related activity was specific for the moment of movement initiation, as large accelerations within bouts of movement were not encoded by mDA neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). We next sought to clarify whether the magnitude of movement initiation-related mDA excitation reflects animal's reward expectation. We divided periods of self-initiated movement into those accompanied by licking (Lick+) and those without (Lick-), and examined mDA activity in neurons significantly excited or inhibited around movement initiation (Fig 5a ). We then compared these self-initiated actions to movements initiated following the reward predictive auditory cues ("cued mvmt"; Fig 5a ). We reasoned that this analysis should distinguish categories of action with relatively less (Lick-), more (Lick +), or most (Cued) degrees of reward expectation. A 2-way ANOVA (movement type x movement response type) confirmed a main effect of movement response type (excited vs inhibited at mvmt, F (1,216) = 149.8, p < 0.0001) as well as a main effect of movement type (Lick-vs Lick+ vs Cued, F(2,216) = 18.1, p < 0.0001) and an interaction (F (2, 216) = 5.6, p = 0.004). Post hoc comparisons found that indeed, in mDA neurons positively modulated by movement initiation, Lick+ movements were accompanied by greater excitation than Lickmovements (3.2 ± 0.6 vs 1.0 ± 0.4 Hz, p = 0.036, n = 23), consistent with the proposal that the excitatory action initiation-related component of mDA responses is sensitive to reward expectation. In contrast, inhibition apparent in negatively modulated mDA neurons was independent of expectation (-2.3 ± 0.3 vs -1.8 ± 0.3 Hz, p = 0.92, n = 51; Fig. 5a-b ). Furthermore, modulation of mDA neuron activity around cued movement was significantly greater than self-initiated movements in both response classes (positively modulated: 4.8 ± 0.6 Hz, p < 0.0001 vs Lick-; negatively modulated: -0.4 ± 0.5 Hz, p = 0.05 vs Lick-, p = 0.002 vs Lick+; Fig. 5a-b ), with the exception that in movement-excited neurons, cued movement responses were not significantly greater than self-initiated, Lick+ responses (3. Excitation and inhibition were balanced such that there was a negligible self-initiated movement signal on average and a net inhibition during movements in naïve mice (Fig. 2 ). This indicates that in our paradigm mDA activity is not obligatory for movement. However, it has recently been proposed that excitation in select mDA SNc neurons is specifically sufficient 24 or perhaps even necessary 25 for movement initiation. Thus, we sought to directly test whether bursts of mDA activity of the duration and magnitude observed in our task might be responsible for initiating movement. We injected the red-shifted Ca 2+ -indicator jRCaMP1a bilaterally directly under stimulation fiber sites in the SNc or VTA of separate cohorts of mice (n = 4 per group). We then performed fiberometry recordings in the primary targets of those regions in the ventral (vSTR) or dorsal (dSTR) striatum, respectively (Fig 6a ). Following 2-4 days of trace conditioning, we made use of our ability to monitor axonal population activity to calibrate somatic optogenetic stimulation to observed reward signals at the same recording sites (4 total conditions: axonal Ca 2+ responses that were, respectively, 1.1 ± 0.3, 2.8 ± 0.4, 2.1 ± 0.5, and 5.2 ± 1 times the magnitude of cued reward responses; see Methods; Fig. 6a-e ). Neither SNc nor VTA stimulation matched to physiological signals was sufficient to elicit significant movement initiation (Fig. 6c, e ). Indeed, only one condition, the strongest stimulation in the SNc, resulted in a significant modulation of movement (VTA: 1-way ANOVA p = 0.8, n = 4; SNc: 1-way ANOVA p = 0.01, baseline vs 150 ms, 1 mW stim: p = 0.8, baseline vs 150 ms, 7 mW stim: p = 1, baseline vs 500 ms, 1 mW stim: p = 0.6, baseline vs 500 ms, 7 mW stim: p < 0.0001, n = 4; Fig. 6b-e ; Supplementary Fig. 6 ). As a positive control, stimulation of mDA neurons matched to the magnitude of physiological reward signals (150 ms, 30 Hz burst at 1 mW peak power) was able to induce conditioned place preference in a single 60 minute session (Fig. 6f-g ; VTA: 50 ± 8 % in stim quadrant vs 17 ± 3 % in others, n = 4, p = 0. 02; SNc: 42 ± 6 % in stim quadrant vs 22 ± 8 % in others, n = 4, p = 0.03). Thus, taken together these data argue that in the context of our task and within the physiological range of activity we observe in both electrophysiological and calcium imaging, phasic mDA neuron activity at the time of movement does not (exclusively) reflect activity that is causal for movement initiation 39 . Emergence of RPE correlates in mDA activity during novel learning How do these sensory cue-related and movement initiation-related response components contribute to the quantitative representation of reward, and specifically RPE correlates, in mDA neurons? RPE correlates are well known to be present in animals after extensive conditioning 3 ; however, it is unclear when RPE correlates emerge during initial trace conditioning. To address this question, we began to omit either the auditory cue or water delivery on a subset of trials (<= 10% of trials in any session) once animals exhibited criterion learning (session 4; see Fig. 1c, d ). This produced trials with "unpredicted (uncued) rewards" and "omitted rewards", and thus trials with positive prediction errors and negative prediction errors, respectively 3, 19 . mDA responses to water delivery remained unaffected by the presence or absence of a reward-predictive auditory cue in middle training (pred. vs unpred.: 4.3 ± 0.6 vs 4.1 ± 0.7 Hz, p = 0.65, n = 30) despite clear evidence that mice had learnt the auditory cue was predictive of reward (Fig. 1, 4 ) and had a reduced latency to consume reward when it was preceded by a cue (Fig. 7a ). In late training, cued water delivery began to evoke smaller mDA responses than uncued water delivery (3.1 ± 0.6 vs 4.5 ± 1.0 Hz, p = 0.03, n = 24, Fig 7b-d ). Thus, in late learning we observed clear evidence of positive prediction error correlates in mDA neuron activity. We also examined the response of mDA neurons to omitted rewards to look for a negative prediction error correlate. Brief pauses in mDA neuron activity at the time of omitted rewards have provided the most direct evidence to date for negative prediction errors mediated by inhibition of mDA neurons at the moment of an expected (but omitted) delivery of reward 40, 41 . As with positive prediction errors we observed a significant pause in mDA activity to omitted rewards that emerged during late training, but was not present earlier (middle training: 5.4 ± 0.7 to 5.7 ± 0.9, p = 0.73, n = 16; late training: 5.3 ± 0.6 to 2.6 ± 0.4, p <0.0001, n = 17; Fig. 7d ; Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Thus, the eventual emergence of signed RPE correlates (uncued > cued > 0 > omitted), and the specific shape of the mDA neuron response to water delivery we observed is remarkably consistent with previous observations in mice with ~1000-2000 trials of training 21, 38 . The unpredicted mDA response had two clear peaks ('bimodal') consistent with many previous reports at later stages of training in a variety of species 3 including mice 25, 36 . What has not been appreciated to date is that these two peaks occur at very similar latencies to canonical sensory cue-related responses (~50-150 ms) and the latency to initiate consumptive licking (>150 ms) after uncued water delivery, respectively (Fig. 7a-d ). Additionally, we found that only a subset of individual mDA neurons displayed bimodal response timecourses (Fig 7e ). When analyzed separately, both unimodal and bimodal populations encoded positive prediction errors in the form of larger responses to uncued rewards (unimodal: 7.6 ± 0.5 vs 9.4 ± 0.7, p=0.03, n= 7; bimodal: 9.2 ± 0.7 vs 11.6 ± 1.1, p = 0.006, n = 11) indicating that unimodal responses did not reflect the absence of a component of the mDA response; rather, bimodal and unimodal response timecourses could reflect differences in temporal integration. One key difference in action timing could dictate these changes in integration: while during bimodal responses the latency from reward delivery to the first rewarded lick event was significantly longer for cued vs uncued rewards (155 ± 9 vs 213 ± 27 ms, n = 11, p = 0.002), this difference was smaller and nonsignificant during the recording of unimodal responses (142 ± 14 vs 162 ± 1 ms, n = 7, p = 0.06). The timing of action thus correlates with the timecourse of the mDA RPE correlate, indicating that temporal integration of sensory cue-related and action initiation-related components determines mDA reward expectation signals. A model sufficient to account for the emergence of RPE correlates To further assess whether temporal integration was quantitatively consistent with our data, we developed a model with the minimal features we propose to explain mDA responses during early learning. mDA responses integrate: (1) an excitation associated with reward predictive sensory cues that strengthens with learning and (2) an excitation-inhibition sequence around initiation of appetitive actions (e.g. lick bouts) constant throughout learning. Predicted mDA neuron responses were generated by convolving these impulse response functions with observed behavior distributions (Fig. 7c ; the distribution of latencies to initiate consummatory lick bouts) across training phases (Fig. 8 ; Supplemental Methods). This reduced model was sufficient to account for the detailed time course of mDA neuron activity throughout novel learning (Fig. 8 ). Canonical implementation models of RPE predict that the magnitude of inhibition to an omitted reward is necessarily correlated with the difference between predicted and unpredicted rewards (e.g. equations 3 and 4 in 15 ). As noted above, our data exhibit a positive, rather than negative, correlation inconsistent with predictions from such models (Fig. 4c-e ). In the implementation we propose here (Fig. 8 ), negative trial by trial correlations are not predicted nor is inhibition required to account for the difference between predicted and unpredicted reward responses. Consistent with our implementation, suppression of activity on omitted trials was uncorrelated with either the timecourse or integrated difference between predicted and unpredicted reward responses (Supplementary Fig. 7a-c ). In contrast, our account predicts that the magnitude of inhibition observed during omitted rewards reflects inhibition following self-initiated movement lacking expectation of reward (i.e. similar to 'lick-' in Fig. 5 ). The magnitude of suppression of mDA neurons on omitted trials was indeed correlated with the magnitude of inhibition during self-initiated movements (Supplementary Fig. 7d-e ). Discussion Here we show that the positive, phasic responses of mDA neurons reflect the summation of an excitation-inhibition sequence related to initiation of appetitive actions and an excitation associated with sensory cues that predict future reward. In both components, the excitation (but not inhibition) is modulated by expectation of reward; however, only the sensory cuerelated excitation depends upon the extent of training. These two sources of input appear to summate and have distinct dynamics during learning. We thus propose that these components of the mDA neuron response may reflect separate afferent pathways consistent with the diverse excitatory inputs to mDA neurons 42 . All inputs, albeit in different ratios 43 , appear to be present in the majority of VTA and SNc mDA neurons consistent with a number of projections from frontal cortex and midbrain that target both mDA neuron populations 42 . Specific inactivation of colliculonigral projections has been observed to block some, but not all, components of mDA neuron responses in trained monkeys 44 consistent with our observations that multiple, dissociable components underlie mDA neuron responses during conditioning. Action determines the timing of mDA signals Phasic mDA activity associated with the initiation of action has been observed many times in the literature; however, the sign, prevalence, timing, and learning-related properties of these correlates are variable across studies [23] [24] [25] 29, 31, 45 . Here we rovide a set of observations obtained in a large set of identified mDA neurons from two major midbrain nuclei during associative learning that can help to reconcile these observations. We find that a majority of mDA neurons receive a sequence of excitation followed by inhibition around movement initiation, even in naïve animals. Movement-related inhibition appears more constant than excitation, as the introduction of rewards to the context significantly increased excitation at least in the SNc subpopulation. However, even in a rewarded context, selfinitiated movement did not result in large excitation across the entire population, but only within a minority of individual neurons in both VTA and SNc. Arguing against a movement-specific subpopulation in our data, of 21 individual mDA neurons lacking excitation to reward cues, only 1 exhibited significant excitation around self-initiated movement (Supplementary Fig. 1d ), while over the population movement initiation-related and sensory cue-related activity was positively correlated (Fig. 5d , n = 96, r = 0.35, p < 0.001). We note that our recordings were localized to relatively lateral VTA and medial SNc. These subregions contain a substantial portion of midbrain dopamine neurons, and are less diverse in their connectivity, response patterns, and biophysical properties than the medial VTA and lateral SNc, which might exhibit more specialization 43, 46 . While we did not observe a clear dissociation between mDA neurons that respond to action initiation and sensory cues, we note that the characteristic response to movement initiation was correlated with a difference in baseline firing rate (Supplementary Fig. 1c ) consistent with mDA heterogeneity reflected in the biophysics of individual neurons 46 . Optogenetic manipulation can drive a substantially larger and more sustained activation of mDA populations than observed during behavior. Thus, we tested the sufficiency of mDA excitation for the control of movement using stimulation patterns calibrated (within the same animal) to physiological reward signals (largest transients observed during behavior). Stimulation calibrated to reward responses was sufficient to produce conditioned place preference, yet effects on movement were not apparent -arguing for a primary role of phasic DA signals in learning, rather than online behavioral control. A net effect on movement required stimulation at least 5x greater in magnitude and 2x greater in duration than that observed in response to reward and many fold greater than the observed correlate of movement initiation. This data both highlights the value of using calibrated exogenous stimulation and suggests that the typical phasic bursts of mDA activity associated with action initiation are not causal for movement. Rather, our data suggests that these mDA bursts may be a corollary signal associated with certain instances of action initiation under the expectation of a reward. The tight temporal synchronization of certain actions with phasic mDA signals (e.g. Fig 3b ) suggests that the circuit mechanisms for generating phasic movement-related bursts in mDA neurons may fundamentally rely on the transition to action 25, 27, 29 not solely on motivationally-relevant sensory stimuli. RPE correlates emerge following behavioral adaptation Our study is consistent with the fundamental insight that mDA neuron activity reflects aspects of subjective reward expectation 3, 31 . We elaborate a parsimonious model that is the first model to quantitatively account for the precise timecourse of mDA response and the slow emergence of RPE correlates during initial learning. Our model contrasts with qualitative proposals that mDA responses in naïve mice are primarily salience or novelty responses and/or reflect direct sensation of a water reward 3, 15 . Our data and model are consistent with causal evidence that exogenous induction of RPE correlates in mDA neuron activity is sufficient for learning 47, 48 and that even prolonged suppression of mDA neuron activity within trials does not impair motor components of task performance 39, 49 . Detailed analysis of the emergence of mDA activity correlates revealed that both sensory cue-related and action initiation-related mDA neuron activity (at least in part) reflect expectation of reward. Learning drives both changes in behavior (action timing) and enhanced sensory cue-related components that lead the integrated mDA response to correlate with RPE after learning. However, our data and our proposed model calls for a revision of the proposed circuit implementation of RPE signaling during initial learning 2, 15, 36 . The additive combination of sensory-related (input) and movement-related (output) signals in mDA neurons suggests that dopamine release could mediate a Hebbian-like teaching signal reflecting moments when sensory input coincides with action output. Hebbian rules are often sufficient for learning and can be equivalent to error-based rules 50 . Thus, an initial correlation-based teaching signal in the activity of mDA neurons may allow a novice animal to rapidly learn from its successes and later produce RPE correlates that could be useful for reducing errors or adapting to changes in contingency. Methods Animals. All procedures and animal handling were performed in strict accordance with protocols (11-39) that were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and consistent with the standards set forth by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC). For behavior and cell-attached recordings we used 11 adult male DAT-Cre::ai32 mice (10-24 weeks old) resulting from the cross of DAT IREScre (The Jackson Laboratory stock 006660) and Ai32 (The Jackson Laboratory stock 012569) lines of mice, such that a Chr2/EYFP fusion protein was expressed under control of the endogenous dopamine transporter Slc6a3 locus to specifically label dopaminergic neurons. For combined fiber photometry and Chr2-stimulation experiments, we used 8 DAT-Cre::ai32 male mice (14-24 weeks old). The specificity of labelling in the DAT-cre mice has been previously characterized with Rosa26 reporter mice 51 and the DAT-cre::Ai32 double transgenic has been used previously to obtain specific activation of mDA neurons 52 . All animals were handled in accordance with guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Janelia Research Campus. Animals were housed on a 12-hour dark/light cycle (8am-8pm) and recording sessions were all done between 9am-1pm. Following at least 4 days recovery from headcap implantation surgery, animals' water consumption was restricted to 1 mL per day for at least 3 days before training. Mice underwent daily health checks, and water restriction was eased if mice fell below 75% of their original body weight. No randomization procedure was employed to determine inclusion of mice in the study-mice for each experiment type were chosen arbitrarily from among available litters. Behavioral training. Mice were habituated to head fixation in a separate area from the recording rig in multiple sessions of increasing length over >= 3 days, including manual water administration through a syringe. Mice were then habituated to head fixation while resting in a spring-suspended basket in the recording rig for at least two 30+ minute sessions before recordings were attempted or training commenced. No liquid rewards were administered during this recording rig acclimation. Mice head-fixed while resting in a spring-suspended basket were then trained to learn a classical (Pavlovian) auditory trace-conditioning paradigm. The reward consisted of 3 μL of water sweetened with the non-caloric sweetener acesulfame potassium delivered through a lick port under control of a solenoid. In the first training session, a 0.5 s, 10 kHz tone preceded reward delivery by 1.5 s on 100% of trials. In subsequent training sessions, "unpredicted" reward responding was assessed by randomly omitting the predictive tone on 30% of trials during select blocks of trials, with the result that the proportion of unpredicted reward trials never exceeded 10% over any given training session. "Omitted" reward responding was assessed by randomly omitting the reward following a predictive tone on 30% of trials during select blocks of trials, such that the proportion of omitted reward trials never exceeded 10% over any given training session. Intertrial intervals were chosen from randomly permuted exponential distributions (means of ~10, 25, or 50 s) every 20 trials in order to fully disrupt reliable estimation of intertrial interval while keeping the mean interval tractable for recording. Ambient room noise was 50-55 dB, while an audible click of ~53 dB attended solenoid opening upon water delivery and the predictive tone was ~65 dB loud. It should be noted that these stimuli are all quieter than the 72-90 dB stimuli that were reported to activate mDA neurons via their salience in primates 32 . Indeed, in naïve animals no significant modulation was apparent to the tone (Fig. 2a , left), and the timecourse of modulation by reward delivery early in training (Fig. 5a, b ) was not consistent with proposed salience signaling in mDA neurons. However, to control for such signaling as an alternative explanation for the predictive nature of the mDA reward response, we recorded from additional mice trained with an inaudible solenoid (The Lee Company, LHQA1231220H). Behavioral and electrophysiological measurements. Individual licks were timestapped according to deflections of a piezo strip supporting the lick port. Piezo signals were high-pass filtered at 0.1 Hz, then rectified and smoothed by convolving with a square wave in order to facilitate identification of individual tongue strikes during high frequency lick bouts. Basket movements were recorded by a triple-axis accelerometer (Adafruit, ADXL335) attached to the underside of a custom-designed 3D-printed basket suspended from springs (Century Spring Corp, ZZ3-36) well suited to allow robust movements but fully support the ~20-25 g body weight of adult mice. Basket height relative to the point of head fixation was set so that a mouse's back was at a ~30° angle to the plane of the its headcap. This positioning was comfortable for the animals and minimized the translation of body movement to movement of the brain with respect to the skull, allowing for more stable recordings. Raw accelerometer signals summed across all axes were used to identify transitions from rest to movement (movement initiations). Relative basket position was tracked by low-pass filtering accelerometer data at 2.5 Hz to enrich for the signal corresponding to forces due to the angle of the accelerometer with respect to the earth. Both lick and movement events were detected by threshold crossing but were timestamped according to the their earliest deviation from the previous baseline signal. Electrophysiological recordings were made with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) interfaced to a computer by an analog-to-digital converter (National Instruments, PCI 6259) controlled by Axograph X recording software (www.axograph.com). Spikes were recorded in current clamp mode, AC-coupled at 1 Hz, then high-pass filtered at 300 Hz to facilitate simple threshold crossing analysis to generate spike time stamps. Data were smoothed by convolving with a Gaussian function with a 20 ms decay. The above signals as well as the command signals that spanned the predictive tone length, the reward solenoid open time, and the on time of the laser used for optotagging were synchronously recorded and digitized (at 1 kHz for behavioral data, 30 kHz for electrophysiology data) with a Cerebus Signal Processor (Blackrock Microsystems). Stimulations and cue deliveries were coordinated with custom-written software using Arduino Mega hardware (www.arduino.cc). Data was analyzed using Matlab software (Mathworks). Data analysis was done in batches following days or weeks of recording sessions. During initial analysis including timestamping of action potentials and alignment to task and behavioral variables, the experimenter was blinded to the recording location (ventral tegmental area vs substantia nigra) of the individual neuron as well as the training progression of the animal at the time of recording. Blinding to the above variables during data acquisition was not attempted. Cell-attached recording. A small craniotomy (<200 μm diameter) was made over the recording site (from bregma: -3.2 posterior, 0.5 lateral for VTA, -3.0 posterior, 1.5 lateral for SNc) at least 4 hours prior to recording. Exposed brain tissue was kept moist with phosphate-buffered saline at all times, and craniotomy sites were covered with Kwik-Sil elastomer (WPI) outside of the recording session. Borosillicate glass pipettes (Sutter, BF165-120-10) were pulled to a long taper (~10 mm taper) with a ~1-2 μm tip (resistance 4-14 mOhm) with a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter). Pipettes were filled with 0.5 M NaCl solution and mounted in a holder with a side port (Warner, PE30W-T17P) to allow insertion of a fiber (105 μm core, 0.22 NA, Thorlabs) that was coupled to a 473 nm laser (50mW, OEM Laser Systems) to carry light to the pipette tip. An AgCl pellet reference electrode was placed in the well of saline that covered the craniotomy site. Experimental power ranges out of the assembly were estimated by painting the taper of a pipette with nail polish in order to simulate brain tissue attenuation of light escaping the pipette, and were found to be 0.5-1.5 mW across the laser powers used during experiments. Pipettes were lowered through the brain with a micromanipulator (Luigs and Neumann) while a small cycling current injection allowed monitoring of resistance changes across the pipette tip. In addition to stereotactic coordinates, dopaminergic regions could be further targeted empirically by monitoring extracellular potentials in response to brief (<5 ms) flashes of blue light through the pipette tip (Fig. 1E ). The amplitude of population responses closely corresponded to patterns of dopaminergic cell body enrichments predicted from standard coordinates 22 . Deviations from that correspondence represented errors introduced through individual anatomical variation or the plane of headcap attachment to the skull, and referencing of the population response allowed correction on subsequent passes, greatly increasing the yield of identified mDA recordings across the life of each animal. Once within a dopaminergic region, the pipette tip was advanced by 1-2 μm steps until a steep increase in resistance was detected. The pipette was then advanced 5-10 μm until positivegoing spikes were resolved well above noise (>~0.5 mV). ChR2-expression was assayed with 0.5 s 473 nm light stimulations, either in bursts of 1 ms flashes at 10 Hz or continuous pulses. Cells were not re-identified for the remainder of the recording session so as not to interfere with physiological responses. Cells were held for a median of 11 trials (interquartile range 7:19) and a median of 27 self-initiated movements (IQR 14:47). During pilot experiments, 0 of 20 neurons in the first 2 mm of tissue overlying the targeted areas were significantly modulated by stimulation with max laser power (~26 mW out of the fiber tip), indicating that activation due to heating or other nonspecific processes was not a concern. This technique is commonly referred to as "juxtacellular" recording, however that term can imply that transmembrane labelling was always performed. In order to increase yield from each animal, we did not label and recover a majority of cells, instead relying on the depth soundings reported by the extracellular responses to light for a reliable estimation of recording position. However, in some pilot experiments, identified mDA cells were labeled in the juxtacellular configuration for future recovery by including Neurobiotin (Life Technologies) in the pipette solution and entraining spiking with 2 Hz, 50% duty cycle current injections of the minimum amplitude required to entrain spiking (>1 nA). We quantified tone and reward responses by averaging firing rates over a 500-ms window following the cue and subtracting the average baseline firing rate in the 1000 ms preceding tone delivery 21 . We quantified movement responses by averaging firing rates over a 300-ms window beginning 50 ms before movement initiation and subtracting baseline firing ratesthis window was chosen in order to capture the bulk of both excitatory and inhibitory responses across different neurons. Slightly different windows were used for one-tailed tests of significant modulations of activity by movement initiation in single cells: for excitation, a 200 ms window beginning 100 ms before initiation was used; for inhibition, a 300 ms window beginning at the moment of movement initiation was used. These parameters better described the activity during the optimal windows for each signal. The numbers of cells recorded in each trail type for each animal is detailed in Supplementary Table 1 . Combined fiber photometry and optogenetic stimulation. In the course of a single surgery session, DAT-Cre::ai32 mice received: 1) Bilateral injections of AAV2/1-CAG-FLEX-jRCaMP1a in the VTA (50-100 nL at the coordinates -3.1 mm A/P, 1.3 mm M/L from bregma, at depths of 4.6 and 4.3 mm) or in the SNc (100 nL at the coordinates -3.2 mm A/P, 0.5 mm M/L, depth of 4.3 mm) 2) Custom 0.39 NA, 200 μm fiber cannulas implanted bilateral directly above the injection sites, (VTA: -3.2 mm A/P, 0.5 mm M/L, depth of -4.1 mm; SNc: -3.2 mm A/P, 1.4 mm M/L, depth of 4 mm) 3) Fiber cannula implanted unilaterally in either dorsal striatum (0.9 mm A/P, 1.5 mm M/L, depth of 2.5 mm) or ventral striatum (1.5 mm A/P, 0.85 mm M/L, depth of 4.1 mm). Hemisphere choice was counterbalanced across individuals. Imaging began 20 days post-injections using a fiber photometry system custom-built around a 5-port filter cube (FMC5, Doric Lenses). The system was designed with two parallel excitation-emission channels to allow for simultaneous measurement of RCaMP1a and eYFP fluorescence, the latter channel having the purpose of controlling for the presence of movement artifacts. 470 nm and 565 nm fiber-coupled LEDs (M470F3, M565F3, Thorlabs) were connected to excitation ports with acceptance bandwidths of 465-490 nm and 555-570 nm respectively with 200 μm, 0.22 NA fibers (Doric Lenses). Light was conveyed between the sample port of the cube and the animal by a 200 μm core, 0.39 NA fiber (Doric Lenses) terminating in a ceramic ferrule that was connected to the implanted fiber cannula by a ceramic mating sleeve (ADAL1, Thorlabs) using index matching gel to improve coupling efficiency (G608N3, Thorlabs). Light collected from the sample fiber was measured at separate output ports (emission bandwidths 500-540 nm and 600-680 nm) by 600 μm core, 0.48 NA fibers (Doric Lenses) connected to silicon photoreceivers (2151, Newport). Signals from the receivers were streamed into the Blackrock Cerebus Signal Processor described above at 30 kHz. In order to avoid influencing physiological RCaMP signals, blue excitation for the measurement of the static eYFP signal was only used intermittently outside of recording periods to verify the absence of significant movement artifacts aligned to task variables or somatic mDA stimulation. LEDs were controlled at a frequency of 50 Hz (3 ms on, 17 ms off) by TTL signals which were recorded so that excitation-specific signals could be resolved in analysis using custom-written Matlab code. Somatic Chr2 excitation was performed with a 473 nm laser (50mW, OEM Laser Systems) coupled by a branching fiber patch cord (200 μm, Doric Lenses) to the SNc or VTAimplanted fiber cannulas using a ceramic mating sleeve. 30 Hz burst activations (10 ms on, 23 ms off) were delivered with durations of either 150 ms or 500 ms. Two levels of laser power were used, resulting in 1 mW or 7 mW peak power with constant illumination, measured at the tip of the ferrule of the patch cable. The lower level of 1 mW was chosen because when given in a 150 ms-duration burst it resulted in axonal Ca2+ signals equivalent to those measured in response to reward delivery after 2-4 training sessions. For movement initiation sufficiency tests (Fig. 7b-d ), burst stimulations were delivered with interstimulus intervals randomly chosen from an exponential distribution with a mean of 32 seconds. One of the four burst options (low or high power, short or long burst) were chosen at random for each trial. Conditioned place preference. Mice were placed in an open arena with a clear floor through which video data was monitored, and their VTA-or SNc-targeted fibers were mated to the laser patch cable tethered to a commutator suspended above the arena. One quadrant was chosen at random in which the mouse would receive bilateral laser burst stimulation (calibrated to a rewardequivalent level: 150 ms long, 30 Hz burst with 1 mW peak power), and stimulation was triggered by entry into an area within one-half of the quadrant's length from the corner of the quadrant (see Fig 7f ). Stimulation was delivered with a minimum interstimulus interval of 4 seconds while the mouse was in the designated stimulation area. This intermittent schedule was chosen rather than the more common constant burst illuminations used in order to be comparable to the isolated bursts used in the tests for movement initiation sufficiency. Sessions lasted 60 minutes and time spent in each quadrant was totaled over the entirety of the session. Statistical analysis. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications 7, 21, 23 . Data distribution was assumed to be normal but was not formally tested for normality. Paired comparisons were made using twotailed Students' t-tests, except where significance was tested for individual neuron activity aligned to movement or reward, in which case one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed. Multiple comparisons were made using ANOVAs with Tukey's post-hoc multiple comparisons test (Graphpad Prism). Contingency testing was done with the chisquared test. Errors are reported as standard errors of the mean (s.e.m.). All sample sizes refer to the number of distinct neurons summarized in the data, or for behavioral quantification (e.g. Fig. 2b ), it refers analogously to the number of distinct neuron recording sessions during which behavior was quantified. For the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of differences between baseline and delay period (anticipatory) licking, number of licks were counted per 100 ms-bins in the baseline period 1000 ms before cue delivery, and compared to lick counts in 100 ms bins during the 1000 ms delay period following cessation of the auditory cue. Histology. Mice were killed by anesthetic overdose (isoflurane, >3%) and perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by paraformaldehyde (4% wt/vol in PBS). Brains were post-fixed for 2 h at 4° C and then rinsed in saline. Whole brains were then sectioned (100 μm thickness) using a vibrating microtome (VT-1200, Leica Microsystems). For recovery of juxta-labelled cells from pilot experiments exemplified in Fig 1e-g , slices were incubated with Alexafluor 594-conjugated streptavidin to visualize Neurobiotin-labeled neurons against the backdrop of EYFP-expressing mDA neurons. Model simulations. Simulations were implemented in Matlab as described in Figure 8 and the main text. Example simulation code related to Figure 8 is available at www.dudmanlab.org/html/ learnda.html.

Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. predicted mDA activity panels: Impulse response functions were derived from data using a either a single excitatory Gaussian function for cue-related activity or a sequence of excitatory and delayed inhibitory Gaussian functions for movement-related activity (Fig. 3 , 5, 7). Impulse response functions scaled by input strength for cue-related activity or scaled and convolved with a probability distribution matching observed behavior distributions for movement-related activity (distributions fit to Fig. 7 ). This yielded two components of mDA activity (cue-related in cyan and movement-related in magenta). Simulated mDA responses are the sum of these components for predicted (red) and unpredicted (black) water delivery. Lower box compares simulated mDA responses and to mDA neuron recording data for comparison. See Matlab code in Supplemental Methods to recreate figure. 2 ± 0.6 vs 4.8 ± 0.6 Hz, p = 0.25, Fig 5b). Importantly, responses to self-initiated movement were not correlated with training (Fig 5c, r = 0.1, p = 0.32) but were correlated with their response to auditory cues (Fig 5d, r = 0.35, p < 0.001), as can be appreciated in the blunted cue responses for mDA neurons significantly inhibited around movement (Fig 5a, right; p < 0.0001). Together, these results suggest that mDA neuron activity reflects the sum of action initiation and reward-predictive sensory cue inputs. Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1. Juxtacellular recording from identified midbrain dopamine neurons in awake, behaving mice. a) Schematic of the head-fixed behavioral apparatus. Mice were head-fixed in front of water port tube positioned within tongue-length and supported by a spring-suspended basket monitored by an accelerometer. Small droplets of sweetened water (~3 uL) were delivered by opening a valve on a gravity fed line; a suspended drop of liquid stayed on port until collected by licking. b) Auditory stimuli, openings of a solenoid water valve (reward), vibration of the water port due to licking (licking), and juxtacellular recordings from identified midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons could be recorded simultaneously with bodily movements that displaced basket position relative to its resting position (relative basket position). c) Licking (upper) and basket displacement (lower, 'mvmt') in response to auditory cue (shaded gray bar) and sweetened water delivery (dashed line) averaged for the same mouse at training sessions 1, 3, and 8, n = 50 trials for each average trace. d) (upper) Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve to assess whether number of licks differed significantly from baseline (first session to reach significance at p < 0.05 for each animal indicated with asterisk) during the 1 second delay between cue and reward.

Physiological mDA stimulation supports learning but is insufficient to provoke movement initiation a) Illustration of strategy used to record projection-specific mDA activity while optogenetically stimulating mDA somata (see Methods for details). Briefly, AAVs carrying a cre-dependent transgene for a red genetically encoded calcium indicator (jRCamp1a) were injected into either VTA or SNc. Fibers were implanted in either SNc and dorsal striatum (dSTR; upper) or VTA and ventral striatum (vSTR; lower) to allow simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and fiberometry of mDA axons. b) Comparison of reward responses recorded in mDA SNc>dSTR projections to responses to 150 and 500 ms-duration optogenetic burst stimulations at low (1 mW peak, dark green) and high (7 mw peak, light green) laser power. c) For an example mouse (1 of 4) average basket movement is plotted relative to time of stimulation onset.

(Left box) Simulations assumed two classes of excitation onto mDA neurons: Sensory cue-related (cyan) and movement initiation-related (purple). All excitatory inputs are independent functions of reward expectation with a shared history of reward experience. In addition, movement-related input contained delayed inhibition.

osmolytes like taurine (6) (hence VSOAC, volume-stimulated organic osmolyte/anion channel (7) ), but this notion is controversial (8) (9) (10) . VRAC is believed to be important for cell volume regulation and swelling-induced exocytosis (11) , and also for cell cycle regulation, proliferation and migration (1, 3, 4) . It may play a role in apoptosis and various pathological 3 states including ischemic brain edema and cancer (4, 12) . Progress in the characterization of VRAC and its biological roles has been limited by the failure to identify the underlying protein(s) despite efforts for decades (1, 5) . ClC-2 Cl --channels activate upon cell swelling, but their inward rectification and Cl -over I -selectivity deviate from VRAC (13) Drosophila dBest1, a member of a family of Ca 2+ -activated Cl --channels, mediates swelling-activated Cl -currents in insect cells (14, 15) , but their characteristics differ from VRAC currents and the mammalian homolog of dBest1 is swelling-insensitive (16) . We show that VRAC represents a distinct class of anion channels that also conduct organic osmolytes. To identify VRAC, we opted for a genome-wide RNA interference screen that could identify non-redundant VRAC components. Swelling-induced iodide influx into HEK cells expressing the iodide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein YFP(H148Q/I152L) (17) was used as read-out in a fluorometric imaging plate reader (Fig. 1A ). Exposure to saline containing 50 mM iodide entailed a slow fluorescence decay under isotonic conditions, whereas hypotonicity induced a delayed increase in YFP quenching (Fig. 1B ) that could be reduced by VRAC inhibitors like carbenoxolone (18) (fig. S1 ). In a prescreen targeting 21 anion transporters (table S1 ), only siRNAs against the Cl -/HCO 3 -exchanger AE2 gave significant effects (Fig. 1B ). They decreased iodide influx under both isotonic and hypotonic conditions. Our genome-wide screen utilized three separately transfected siRNAs per gene (fig. S2 ). Offline data analysis (fig. S3 , A and B) yielded the maximal slope of fluorescence quenching that was used to define hits. Further criteria included the presence of predicted transmembrane domains and a wide expression pattern. 87 genes (table S2 ) were taken into a secondary screen with independent siRNAs. Of these, only suppression of LRRC8A robustly slowed hypotonicity-induced YFP quenching (Fig. 1C ). LRRC8A knock-down also strongly suppressed I Cl(swell) in patch-clamp experiments (Fig. 1 , D to F), suggesting that the multispan membrane protein LRRC8A is an indispensable component of VRAC or is needed for its activation. Although LRRC8A reached the plasma membrane (fig. S4A for HeLa cells), its transfection into HEK cells rather decreased I Cl(swell) (Fig. 1F ). We hypothesized that VRAC contains LRRC8A as part of a heteromer and that LRRC8A overexpression led to a subunit stoichiometry that was incompatible with channel activity. LRRC8A has four closely related homologs (LRRC8B -LRRC8E) which all have four predicted transmembrane domains (19, 20) . EST databases suggested that all homologs were widely expressed. Immunocytochemistry of transfected HeLa cells (fig. S4A ) and of native HEK cells (Fig. 1 , G and H) detected LRRC8A at the plasma membrane. Truncation of its carboxy-terminus as in a patient with agammaglobulinemia (21) led to cytoplasmic retention (fig. S4B ). LRRC8B through LRRC8E remained intracellular when transfected alone, but reached the plasma membrane when co-transfected with LRRC8A (Fig. 1 , I and J, fig. S4 , C to H). Unlike LRRC8A transfection, LRRC8A/LRRC8C co-expression did not suppress I Cl(swell) (Fig. 1F ). However, neither this co-expression, nor any other combination tested, significantly increased current amplitudes above WT levels. We used zinc-finger nuclease and CRISPR/Cas (22) technologies to constitutively disrupt LRRC8 genes. Besides polyploid HEK cells we used stably diploid human HCT116 cells for increased disruption efficiency. Gene disruption was confirmed by sequencing and Western blots (Fig. 2A , table S3 ). To exclude off-target effects, we generated two HEK and three HCT116 lines in which LRRC8A was disrupted at different positions (tables S3 and S4). I Cl(swell) was abolished in all five lines and could be rescued by LRRC8A transfection (Fig. 2, B and C, and fig. S5 ), proving that LRRC8A is essential for I Cl(swell) . We also produced HCT116 cells in which other LRRC8 genes were disrupted singly or in combinations, including a line with disruption of all five LRRC8 genes (henceforth called LRRC8 -/-cells). Except for LRRC8A, disruption of single LRRC8 genes did not abolish VRAC currents (Fig. 2, B and C ). LRRC8A transfection into quintuple KO LRRC8 -/-cells failed to rescue I Cl(swell) (Fig. 2, E and F), agreeing with the absence of I Cl(swell) in LRRC8(B/C/D/E) -/-cells (Fig. 2 , B and C). Cotransfecting LRRC8 -/-cells with LRRC8A and either LRRC8C or LRRC8E yielded I Cl(swell) with current densities similar to native cells (Fig. 2F ). Co-expressing LRRC8A with LRRC8D yielded lower currents (Fig. 2 , E and F). No current was observed upon LRRC8A+B coexpression, which may relate to the poor expressibility of LRRC8B (Fig. 3 , D and F). These findings fit to the low currents of LRRC8(C/E) -/-cells (Fig. 2C ) where LRRC8A can only interact with poorly expressible LRRC8B and/or LRRC8D. Reconstituted I Cl(swell) activated like WT VRAC upon swelling (Fig. 2E ) and displayed its typical anion permeability sequence (fig. S6, B and C). I Cl(swell) inactivated more slowly and at more positive voltages when LRRC8A was coexpressed with LRRC8C in LRRC8 -/-cells compared to cells co-expressing LRRC8A with LRRC8E or LRRC8D (Fig. 2 , E and G, and fig. S6E ). This observation agreed with the faster I Cl(swell) inactivation in LRRC8C -/-cells (Fig. 2 , B and D, and fig. S6D ) in which the 'decelerating' LRRC8C subunit may be replaced by LRRC8E or other 'accelerating' subunits. Native I Cl(swell) currents display different inactivation kinetics (3) . Whereas I Cl(swell) shows prominent inactivation at positive potentials in HEK (23, 24) (Fig. 1E , Fig. 2D , and fig. S6D ) and even more so in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2 , B and D, and fig. S6D ), it inactivates much less in blood cells like promyelocytic HL-60 cells, and in vascular smooth muscle and neurons (24) (25) (26) . EST databases suggest that these cells express the 'decelerating' subunit LRRC8C, but lack LRRC8E that potently induces inactivation (Fig. 2 , E and G, and fig. S6E ). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that HEK and HCT116 cells expressed LRRC8A through LRRC8E, whereas LRRC8E was almost absent from HL-60 cells (fig. S7 ). Moreover, HCT116 cells, whose I Cl(swell) inactivates more than that of HEK cells (Fig. 1E , Fig. 2 , B and D, and fig. S6D ), express less 'decelerating' LRRC8C than HEK (fig. S7 ). LRRC8 proteins have four predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) followed by hydrophilic C-termini with up to 17 leucine-rich repeats (27) (hence LRRC8 = leucine-rich repeat containing 8) (Fig. 3A ). Their C-termini were originally thought to be extracellular (19, 21) , but proteome databases revealed (20) that the TMD2-TMD3 linker can be phosphorylated and suggested that LRRC8 N-and C-termini are cytoplasmic (Fig. 3A ). LRRC8 proteins display weak homology (20) to pannexins, pore-forming proteins (28) with connexin-like topology. Connexins form hexameric hemichannels and gap junctions (29) . This similarity suggested (20) that LRRC8 proteins form hexameric channels for so far unknown substrates. Just like VRAC currents (14, 15, 30) , LRRC8 proteins are found in vertebrates, but not in other phyla like arthropoda (20) . We ascertained the pannexin-and connexin-like transmembrane topology of LRRC8A. Mutating potential N-linked glycosylation sites between TMD1 and TMD2 abolished the size shift upon PNGaseF treatment (Fig. 3B ), demonstrating that this loop is extracellular. Immunofluorescence of cells transfected with HA-tagged LRRC8A constructs showed that the TMD3-4 segment is extracellular and the C-terminus cytoplasmic (Fig. 3C ). The formation of LRRC8 heteromers was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from HEK cells transfected with LRRC8A and epitope-tagged versions of either LRRC8B, C, D, or E. LRRC8A co-precipitated each of the other isoforms, but not the Cl --channel ClC-1 used as control (Fig. 3, D and E ). Conversely, precipitation of epitope-tagged versions of LRRC8B through LRRC8E brought down LRRC8A (Fig. 3F ). Co-precipitation of LRRC8 isoforms was also observed for native HEK cells (fig. S8 ). Hypotonicity induced a robust taurine efflux from HEK and HCT116 cell lines, but not from their LRRC8A -/-derivates (Fig. 4A and fig. S9A ) where it could be rescued by LRRC8A/LRRC8C co-transfection (fig. S9B for HEK). Taurine efflux was also abolished in LRRC8(B/C/D/E) -/-HCT116 cells (Fig. 4A ). Since both I Cl(swell) and swelling-induced taurine efflux similarly depended on LRRC8 heteromers, VRAC is most likely identical to VSOAC, the volume-stimulated organic osmolyte/anion channel (7) . Accordingly, LRRC8A -/-HEK cells showed severely impaired volume regulation. After initial swelling, WT, but not LRCC8A -/- cells slowly reduced their cell volume in the continuous presence of extracellular hypotonicity (Fig. 4B ). Hence, LRRC8-containing VSOAC is a major player in RVD. The identification of LRRC8 proteins as crucial VRAC constituents ends a decades-long hunt for the elusive molecular identity of this important channel. The absence of I Cl(swell) upon genomic disruption of LRRC8A and its rescue by transient re-expression identified LRRC8A as an indispensable component of VRAC, or alternatively as being crucial for its activation. The wide expression pattern of LRRC8 genes and the plasma membrane residency of LRRC8A-containing heteromers are fulfilled prerequisites for LRRC8 proteins forming the channel. The dependence of current properties on LRRC8 isoform combinations indicated that LRRC8 heteromers are integral components of VRAC, a notion buttressed by the homology of LRRC8 proteins to pannexins. Since co-transfection of LRRC8 isoforms failed to significantly increase I Cl(swell) amplitude over WT levels other factors limit VRAC activity. Such a limiting component might be an auxiliary subunit of VRAC or could be part of the signaling cascade leading to its activation. Indeed VRAC currents seem to be highly regulated, with amplitudes differing only 2-3fold across cell types (3, 30) . The homology between LRRC8 proteins and pannexins suggested that LRRC8 proteins form hexameric channels (20) . We confirmed the pannexin-like topology of LRRC8A and propose that VRAC is formed by LRRC8 hexamers of LRRC8A and minimally one other family member. In this model, VRAC may contain two to five different LRRC8 isoforms. This could create a large variety of VRAC channels with different properties. The variation of I Cl(swell) inactivation kinetics between different tissues and cells (3) can now be ascribed to different expression ratios of LRRC8 isoforms. LRRC8-dependent Cl --and taurine-fluxes indicated that VRAC is identical to VSOAC (6) and fit to a pore formed by LRRC8 hexamers because hexameric pannexin channels likewise display poor substrate specificity (28) . Our work provides the basis to explore the structure-function relationship of VRAC/VSOAC, to clarify the signal transduction from cell volume increase to channel opening, and to investigate the role of the channel in basic cellular processes like cell division, growth, and migration and in various pathological states. Interestingly, a truncating LRRC8A mutation has been described in a patient with agammaglobulinemia (21) and LRRC8C may have a role in fat metabolism (31) . Supplementary Materials Contain: Materials and Methods Author contributions Figures S1-S10 Parameters Extracted from FLIPR TM Screen and Bioinformatics Analysis Several parameters were extracted from the primary data and used for subsequent data evaluation (fig. S3, A and B ). The averaged fluorescence before the pipetting step, F abs ante , was obtained by averaging values from measurements 1-3 and was used to set a warning 'low cell' flag when its value was less than 0.8 times of mean F abs ante averaged over all experimental wells from the plate. After pipetting, the fluorescence acutely changed to new values that were more or less stable for about 30 s before swelling-induced quenching of YFP set in. We averaged fluorescence values from measurements 9 to 12 to obtain F abs start which was subsequently used for normalization. F abs fin was defined as averaged fluorescence from the four last measurements and we set another warning flag if fluorescence had not reached quasi-steady-state at the end of the measurement. F abs fin might be used for background subtraction. We preferred, however, to subtract F BG TX100 , the averaged (over the last 300 s) fluorescence of the four control wells from the same plate that had been exposed to Triton X100 to maximally quench YFP fluorescence. The background-subtracted fluorescence value of each well was then normalized to the corresponding F abs start value to yield F* (fig. S3B ). siRNA-mediated knock-down of VRAC should reduce iodide current magnitude, but not necessarily the final intracellular iodide concentration (reflected in F abs fin ). Although not being a linear function of iodide influx, the speed of YFP quenching after exposure to hypotonicity is the best indicator for the magnitude of VRAC currents. We therefore determined the slope of fluorescence change by linear regression of 11 points in a sliding window between 35 and 350 s. The maximum of these slopes was defined as S max . The intersection of the corresponding linear regression line with F*=1 defined t onset as a measure for the speed of response to the hypotonic challenge, a delay that might be changed e.g. by interfering with the signal transduction cascade leading to VRAC opening (fig. S3B ). For each individual plate we then calculated the mean maximal slope S max mean of all experimental wells and the corresponding standard deviation. S max of each individual siRNA-treated well was expressed in terms of standard deviations to yield Z-scores, with e.g. Z=2 meaning that the slope is slower by two standard deviations compared to the average of the plate. siRNAs leading to cell death or targeting YFP confirmed that results of none of the 384-well plates had to be discarded because of low transfection efficiency. Results were sorted by genes and listed individually for each of the three siRNAs (which generally were on different plates) the Z-score, t onset , F abs ante , F abs fin , the low-cell and the non-steady-state flags (1 or 0). It also listed the protein families associated with the gene products (as obtained from UniProtKB database (32)), the genes' tissue expression pattern (as determined by publicly available microarray data (33) ) and predicted number of transmembrane domains that was calculated by the software TMHMM 2.0c (34) . Comparison of the first and replicate screen showed that the effects of individual siRNAs on the respective Z-scores of S max correlated reasonably well and demonstrated the usefulness of our warning flags (fig. S3, C and D ). To account for different efficiencies of siRNA knock-down with the three individual siRNAs against each gene, some of which may be ineffective or show off-target effects, we sorted our results according to the mean Z obtained with the two 'best' siRNAs (giving the largest values of Z). As expected, many of the hits could be ruled out by one or more criteria. For instance, siRNAs against several ribosomal proteins led to large Z-scores that were caused by poor cell growth or cell death as indicated by the 'low cell' flag. Large Z-scores that were not reproduced in the replicate screen could sometimes be eliminated by examining the photographs of the plates which showed dirt at the respective well that had caused high background fluorescence. As we were looking for the channel itself and not for proteins involved in the activation of VRAC, we limited our search to proteins having at least one predicted transmembrane domain. Many candidates could be eliminated by their wellestablished function or their inclusion in well-known gene families like olfactory receptors or other G-protein coupled receptors. However, as annotations are not always reliable and as proteins may serve more than one function, several candidates whose annotated function appeared to be incompatible with VRAC function but which otherwise seemed promising were earmarked for a secondary screen. As VRAC currents have been observed in every mammalian tissue that has been investigated, we excluded candidates that showed a narrow tissue distribution or very low expression levels as indicated by NCBI EST profile databases or the scientific literature, except when they belonged to a gene family whose overlapping expression pattern covered many tissues. On the basis of these criteria 87 candidate genes (table S2 ) were selected for a secondary screen that used again the FLIPR TM assay with pools of four siRNAs (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA, Thermo Scientific) that were different from the ones used in the primary screen. Of these genes, only LRRC8A passed the test. The SMART pool directed against LRRC8A slowed hypotonicity-induced quenching of YFP fluorescence better than the SMART-pool against AE2 (Fig. 1C ). It is interesting to note that LRRC8A was at the 222 nd position of hits sorted exclusively by the mean Z-score averaged across both screens from the 2 out of 3 siRNAs per gene that gave the best score. Only one of the three siRNAs against LRRC8A gave a Z-score for maximal slope of ~2, the two others were below 1 (fig. S3E ). Generation of Monoclonal Knock-out Cell Lines Using the CRISPR/Cas and Zinc-finger Nuclease Technologies For the disruption of LRRC8 genes by the CRISPR/Cas system in cell culture, we used the px330 single plasmid system as described (22) . The targeting sgRNA sequences were chosen using both the UCSC Genome Browser tool at www.genome-engineering.org and the sequence collection from (35) (for sequences, table S4 ).Target sgRNAs were cloned into the px330 vector and transfected into the described YFP expressing HEK293 clone or WT HCT116 cells in a 6-well format using 3 µl of the Fugene HD transfection reagent and 900 ng targeting vector(s) (up to 4) plus 100 ng pEGFP-C1-vector. In HCT116 cells, the LRRC8A gene was additionally disrupted using custom-designed CompoZr ® Knock-out Zinc-Finger Nucleases (Sigma). The zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) pair encoded on two separate plasmids was transfected as the CRISPR/Cas constructs described above, using 500 ng of each ZFNplasmid and 100 ng of the pEGFP-C1 vector. 2-5 days post-transfection single GFP-positive cells were FACS-sorted into 96-well plates containing preconditioned DMEM (for HEK cells) or McCoy's 5A (for HCT116 cells) medium. In some cases, transfected cells were enriched by G418 selection before FACS sorting. Monoclonal cell lines were raised and tested for sequence alterations using target-sitespecific PCR on genomic DNA followed by Sanger-sequencing and/or Western blot analysis to confirm the absence of the protein when specific antibodies were available. To generate multiple KOs of several genes, the respective plasmids were transfected together, or cell lines already carrying LRRC8 gene disruptions were targeted again for other LRRC8 genes. Antibodies Polyclonal antibodies against LRRC8A were raised in rabbits against the peptide QRTKSRIEQGIVDRSE that was coupled to KLH through an N-terminally added cysteine. Its sequence corresponds to LRRC8A protein sequence between TMD2 and TMD3. Polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminus of LRRC8E were raised in rabbits against the peptide LYEGLPAEVREKMEEE that was also coupled with an N-terminally added cysteine to KLH. Sera were affinity-purified against the respective peptide and proved specific in Western blots (Fig. 2A and fig. S10, A and B ) and-for LRRC8A-in immunofluorescence (Fig. 1, G and H, and fig. S10C ). The rabbit anti-KCC1 antibody was described previously (36) . The following commercial primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-myc (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-GFP (A-11122, Life Technologies) for IP and chicken anti-GFP (1020, Aves Lab) for Western blot, mouse anti-α-tubulin (DM1A, Sigma), mouse anti-HA (HA.11, Covance). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 or 546 (Molecular Probes) or to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Expression Constructs and Immunocytochemistry For expression of LRRC8A -E with GFP fused to their N-termini or C-termini, cDNA encoding the respective human protein (or only aa 1-719 for LRRC8A trunc ) was cloned with stop codon into pEGFP-C1 or without stop codon into pEGFP-N1, respectively. For expression of C-terminally RFP-tagged LRRC8A, the cDNA was cloned into pmRFP-N1. cDNA encoding human ClC-1 was in pEGFP-C1. For untagged (co-expression in electrophysiological experiments and LRRC8A antibody testing by Western blot) and Cterminally myc-tagged (deglycosylation experiment and co-immunoprecipitations upon heterologous expression) expression, cDNA encoding LRRC8A was cloned (with and without stop codon, respectively) into pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-)B (Invitrogen). HA-tags (at T307 or at the extreme C-terminus of LRRC8A) and point mutations were introduced by PCR. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing the complete ORF. For immunocytochemistry, cells were transfected (if indicated) with plasmid encoding the respective construct(s) using Fugene HD. 24-36 h after transfection, cells were fixed in pre-cooled methanol at -20°C for 10 min (immunostaining with LRRC8A antibody), or in 2% (topology assay) or 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min followed by a 5-min incubation with 30 mM glycine in PBS at room temperature. Cells were incubated sequentially for 1 h each with primary and secondary antibodies (where applicable) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (or without Triton X-100, for non-permeabilized cells) supplemented with 3% BSA. Images were acquired with an LSM510 confocal microscope with a 63x, 1.4 NA oil-immersion lens (Zeiss). Quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated from cell pellets using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). We subjected ~1 μg of RNA to DNase I (amplification grade, Invitrogen) digestion and subsequently transcribed it into cDNA using random primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). A 20-μl qRT-PCR reaction was set up using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5 µM of specific primers. Reactions were run in triplicates with a 60-s elongation time at 60°C. Amplification and melting curves were monitored using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System and StepOne Software (Applied Biosystems). GAPDH was used as internal control and for ΔΔCt calculations. Primers were designed using the QuantPrime selection tool (37) to preferentially span exon-exon boundaries and to give products of 60-150 bp. The following primer pairs were used (5'-3'): GAPDH: ACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTCTT and GTTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTGA LRRC8A: 10 kHz. The holding potential was -30 mV. Cells with a membrane resistance below 800 MΩ or series resistance above 10 MΩ were discarded. The standard protocol for measuring the time course of I Cl(swell) activation, applied every 15 s after membrane rupture, consisted of a 0.6-s step to -80 mV followed by a 2.6-s ramp from -100 to 100 mV. The read-out for I Cl(swell) was the steady-state whole-cell current at -80 mV normalized to the cell capacitance (current density) subtracted by the baseline current density at -80 mV before perfusion with hypotonic solution. The voltage protocol, applied after complete activation of I Cl(swell) , consisted of 1-s or 2-s steps starting from -120 mV to 120 mV in 20-mV intervals preceded and followed by a 0.5-s step to -80 mV every 5 s. Relative anion permeabilities (P X /P Cl ) were calculated from the shifts in reversal potential induced by perfusion with the anion substituted hypotonic salines using a modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation: hypo subst X Cl subst [Cl] exp [Cl] / [X] rev EF RT PP       where ΔE rev is the shift in reversal potential, [Cl] hypo and [Cl] subst are the extracellular chloride concentrations in the normal and anion substituted hypotonic saline, and [X] subst is the concentration of the substituting anion. R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is the Faraday constant. Reversal potentials were determined by measuring 3 to 6 cells for each cell line or transfection. Liquid junction potentials were measured for all solutions and corrected for in ion selectivity experiments. The inactivation kinetics of I Cl(swell) could not be fitted appropriately by a single-exponential function. We therefore calculated the fraction of remaining current by dividing the current amplitude at the end of the 2-s voltage step by the current amplitude 1.5 ms after the beginning of the voltage step (avoiding contamination by capacitive transients). The half inactivation time t 1/2 was determined by the time point where the inactivation reached half of the total inactivation after 2 s. Calculation of current densities and inactivation characteristics was carried out with an automatic script written in MATLAB R2011a (MathWorks) and plotted with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Boltzmann curve-fitting and calculation of V 1/2 was done with GraphPad Prism with the following fitting constraints: bottom value less than 0.2, top value greater than 0.9. Example current traces were lowpass-filtered at 2 kHz and reduced to a sampling rate of 1 kHz for clarity. Averaged data is presented as mean ± SEM. Significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test, where applicable. At least 4 cells per condition were measured on at least two different days; exact n-values are given in the figures. Where possible, measurements were done blinded. Deglycosylation, Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot To assess glycosylation of LRRC8A, HEK cells were transfected on 10-cm dishes using 17 µl of polyethylenimine (PEI) and 6 µg of plasmid encoding myc-tagged LRRC8A (wild-type or mutant). Cells were lysed in Ripa lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 4 mM Pefabloc (Roth), complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). After 10 min centrifugation at 14.000 rpm at 4°C, protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by BCA assay. 60 µg of total protein were mixed with 2 µl of denaturing buffer (NEB) and 2 µl of 0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 7.4 in a reaction volume of 20 µl and denatured at 75°C for 10 min. Then 4 µl of 10xG7 Buffer (NEB), 4 µl of 10% NP-40 (NEB) and 4 µl of PNGase F (Roche) were added in a total volume of 40 µl. After 2 h incubation at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by adding 10 µl 5xLämmli sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using the LRRC8A antibody. The experiment was repeated 3 times. For co-immunoprecipitation, HEK cells were co-transfected with plasmids (6 µg total) encoding myc-tagged or untagged LRRC8A and N-terminal fusion constructs of LRRC8A-E or ClC-1 (or soluble GFP) on 10-cm dishes using PEI as described above. 48 h posttransfection cells were lysed in 300 µl lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 4 mM Pefabloc (Roth), complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) for 10 min on ice. The lysate was pre-cleared by centrifugation at 14.000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and subsequently spun at 30.000 g for 30 min at 4°C. 150 µl of the supernatant were mixed with 10 µg of the respective antibody and IP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40; 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) was added to final volume of 800 µl. The sample was rotated for 1-2 h at 4°C before 10 µl of Protein A Dynabeads ® (Life Technologies) were added and rotation continued overnight at 4°C. After four washes with 500 µl IP buffer, precipitates were eluted in 40 µl Lämmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as indicated. Lysate equivalent to 20% of input was loaded as reference. Experiments were repeated 3 times. For the immunoprecipitation from native cells, lysates from two confluent 15-cm plates per cell-line (wild-type and LRRC8A -/-) were prepared as described above. 1.9 ml lysate were mixed with equal volumes of IP buffer and 30 µl of Protein A Dynabeads ® (Life Technologies) previously coupled to 15 µg of the LRRC8A antibody using dimethyl pimelimidate. After incubation and washing as described above, precipitates were eluted from the beads in 50 µl of 0.2 M glycine (pH 2.5), mixed with Lämmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as indicated. To assess protein expression, cells were lysed as described above. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA and equal amounts were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as indicated. Taurine Efflux Experiments HEK or HCT116 cells were grown to ~80% confluency (48-72 h after plating) in 35-mm diameter plates coated with poly-L-lysine. For rescue experiments, cells were transfected one day before flux measurements with LRRC8A and LRRC8C-GFP expression plasmids using Fugene HD. For these experiments, WT cells were mock transfected with a GFP expression vector. Cells were loaded with 3 [H]-taurine (2 µCi/ml; Perkin-Elmer) for 2 to 2.5 h in culture medium (without FCS) at 37°C. They were then washed 7 times at room temperature with isotonic solution (in mM: 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 1.5 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose, 10 HEPES pH 7.4, 320 mOsm). After washing, external media were removed in 5-min intervals and replaced with fresh isotonic or hypotonic solution (in mM: 105 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 1.5 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose, 10 HEPES pH 7.4, 240 mOsm) and saved for counting. At the end of the experiment, cells were lysed with 0.75 ml of 0.1 M NaOH. The radioactivity of cell supernatants and of the final cell lysate was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Values presented were normalized to the total cellular radioactivity at that time point which was determined by adding the counts from the cell lysate and those of the supernatants collected at the corresponding and following time points. In each flux experiment, each data point represents the mean of 6 wells. RVD Measurements Cell volume was measured semiquantitatively using the calcein fluorescence method (38) . HEK cells were plated 2 days before measurements at a density of 6,000 cells per well in a 384-well plate. For the RVD assay, 10 µM calcein-AM (Affymetrix eBioscience) in DMEM were loaded for 1 h at 37°C and then washed 3 times with 80 µl isotonic solution (in mM: 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES pH 7.4, 329 mOsm) using a Tecan Freedom EVO 200 workstation. Finally 10 µl of the isotonic solution were added to each well. After a 5-min incubation period the plate was transferred into the FLIPR TM (Molecular Devices) and fluorescence measurements at λ= 515-575 nm were initiated using the FLIPR Fluo4 LED/filter set. After baseline recording for 25 s, 25 µl aqua dest. were added to the wells resulting in a final osmolarity of 94 mOsm. Calcein fluorescence was monitored for ~65 min. Wells containing cells of the respective cell-line not loaded with calcein-AM (but otherwise treated equally) were used for background subtraction, and fluorescence values were normalized to t= 30 s (after the pipetting procedure). Less pronounced swelling and RVD of WT HEK cells was observed under the conditions of our primary screen (exposure to 189 mOsm) and RVD was likewise abolished in LRRC8A -/-cells (not shown). S4 .        * For targeted guide sequences, see table S4 . § Targeting with construct 1B in LRRC8 -/-cell line resulted in a duplication of a1043 which would lead to A349G-fs after TMD4. However, the mutations by the 2B targeting (given in table) truncate LRRC8B already after TMD2. Supplementary Tables However, I Cl(swell) amplitudes were robustly reduced in LRRC8E -/-and in LRRC8(C/E) -/-double and LRRC8(C/D/E) -/-triple knock-out (KO) cells. I Cl(swell) was abolished in LRRC8(B/C/D/E) -/- cells (Fig.2, B and C). I Cl(swell) inactivated faster and at less positive potentials in LRRC8C -/-and LRRC8(C/E) -/-cells compared to wild-type (WT) HCT116, LRRC8B -/-, LRRC8D -/-or LRRC8E -/-cells. By contrast, I Cl(swell) inactivated more slowly and at more positive voltages in LRRC8(D/E) -/-HTC116 cells (Fig.2, B and D, and fig.S6D) and in WT HEK cells (Fig.1E). I Cl(swell) of these mutant cell lines retained the characteristic I ->NO 3 ->Cl - >>gluconate permeability sequence (figS6A).

All wells of the plate were simultaneously illuminated at λ= 495-505 nm and YFP-fluorescence was measured at λ= 526-585 nm using the FLIPR Fluo3 LED/filter set. After 5 measurements in intervals of 5 s, parallel pipetting within the FLIPR TM added 25 μl iodide-containing hypotonic (rows 1-23) (in mM: 70 NaI, 5 NaCl, 5 KCl; 1 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose, 10 HEPES pH 7.4, 189 mOsm) or isotonic (row 24) (in mM: 70 NaI, KCl; 1 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose, 140 mannitol, 10 HEPES pH 7.4, 329 mOsm) solution into each well. The solution added to wells O23, P23, O24 and P24 was hypotonic and contained 1% Triton X100. The mixture of the pre-existing 10 μl isotonic solution and the newly added 25 μl hypotonic solution resulted in a final osmolarity of 229 mOsm, i.e. a ~30% decrease in osmolarity, and a final concentration of 50 mM iodide. Fluorescence measurements were continued for 55 s in 5-s intervals, followed by 8 measurements in 30-s intervals to minimize bleaching, and finally 10 measurements in 1-s intervals. The total amount of measurement (500 s) was sufficient for YFP-quenching to nearly reach steady state. At time points 0 s and 5 s (before pipetting) and at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 490 s (during/after pipetting) photographs of the entire plate were taken to allow post-hoc control of the integrity of the cell layers of each well. All original fluorescence traces were stored for reanalysis. cells were plated onto gelatine-coated coverslips and transfected using Fugene HD (Promega) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) transfection reagents, respectively. One of the transfected LRRC8 isoforms was fused C-terminally to GFP. When LRRC8A was co-transfected with other LRRC8 isoforms only the latter carried GFP because plasma membrane fluorescence indicated co-expression with LRRC8A. Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments were performed in isotonic extracellular solution containing (in mM) 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 1.5 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH (320 mOsm). I Cl(swell) was elicited by perfusing the cells with hypotonic solution containing (in mM) 105 NaCl, 6 CsCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 1.5 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH (240 mOsm). For anion selectivity experiments, NaCl was replaced in this solution by an equimolar amount of NaI, NaNO 3 , or Na-D-gluconate. The pipette solution contained (in mM) 40 CsCl, 100 Cs-methanesulfonate, 1 MgCl 2 , 1.9 CaCl 2 , 5 EGTA, 4 Na 2 ATP, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 with CsOH (290 mOsm). Osmolarities of all solutions were assessed with an Osmomat 030 freezing point osmometer (Gonotec). All experiments were performed at constant temperature of 20-22°C. Currents were recorded with an EPC-10 USB patch-clamp amplifier and PatchMaster software (HEKA Elektronik) or a MultiClamp 700B patch-clamp amplifier/Digidata 1440A digitizer and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Patch pipettes had a resistance of 1-3 MΩ. Series resistance was compensated by 80-90% to minimize voltage errors. Currents were sampled at 5 kHz and low-pass filtered at Fig. S2 . S2 Fig. S2.

(B) Taurine efflux measurement as in (A), but the LRRC8A -/-HEK cells had been co-transfected with LRRC8A and LRRC8C-GFP. This cotransfection partially restores the taurine flux capability of LRRC8A -/-HEK cells. Cotransfection was necessary as overexpression of LRRC8A alone leads to a suppression of I Cl(swell) . Only partial rescue of fluxes with transfected cells agrees with the transfection efficiency of roughly 50%. Fig. S10 . S10 Fig. S10. Characterization of LRRC8A and LRRC8E antibodies.

Clones were selected using 200 µg/ml hygromycin B and 10 µg/ml blasticidin. Monoclonal cell lines were subsequently tested for robust and homogenous expression of YFP after induction with 1.25 μg/ml doxycycline using life-cell imaging. The clone 1:5-( 6 ) was chosen for the genome-wide screening procedure. The cells were kept in DMEM with tetracycline-free Hyclone FCS (Thermo Scientific) and the above-mentioned antibiotics. Genome-wide siRNA Screen The screen was performed at the FMP Screening Unit using the Ambion Silencer ® Human Genome siRNA Library V3 (Life Technologies) containing 189 384-well plates. This library targets each gene by three independently placed siRNAs. The screen was performed in two replicates. Each screening plate contained several controls like siRNA pools against YFP (Silencer GFP siRNA from Ambion), a non-targeting siRNA (Silencer Negative Control from Ambion), an siRNA pool against AE2 (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA SLC4A2 from Thermo Scientific) and a cell death-inducing siRNA mixture (AllStars Hs Cell Death Control siRNA from Qiagen). For detailed plate layout see fig. S2 . For siRNA transfection, in each well of the 384-well assay-plate 8 µl of a 500 nM library-siRNA-OptiMEM ® solution was mixed with 0.2 µl Lipofectamine ® RNAimax transfection reagent (Life Technologies) previously diluted in 11.8 µl Opti-MEM ® (Life Technologies). Subsequently 6000 cells/well in antibioticfree DMEM were seeded onto the pre-dispensed transfection mixture using a BioTek EL406 TM dispenser resulting in a final concentration of 50 nM siRNA in a total volume of 80 µl per well. After 24 h the cell culture medium was exchanged to phenol red-free DMEM containing 1.25 μg/ml doxycycline to induce YFP-expression.

Background The Scottish biting midge, Culicoides impunctatus, is responsible for more than 90% of biting attacks on human beings in Scotland. The painful reactions caused by the bites discourage tourists and disrupt outdoor industries including agriculture and forestry, causing significant losses to the British economy [1] . An estimated 20% loss in working hours each year has been reported in the forestry industry due to midge bites alone [2] . In extreme circumstances, a rate of more than 40 000 midges landing on one forearm every hour has been recorded [3] . Biting midges are known to demonstrate a preference for certain human hosts over others. Anecdotal evidence relating to this phenomenon is now supported by recent scientific evidence. We have shown that host preference is controlled by differences in body odour profiles of different individuals, with non-attractive people producing natural "repellents" [4] . Although the chemical basis for differential attraction to midges is now known, we do not know whether there are particular characteristics or lifestyles that make someone more or less susceptible to attack by midges. The body odours of many vertebrates (including human beings) are known to provide information about individual identity, sex, reproductive status and health to other members of the same species [5] . Therefore, odours that are specifically associated with such factors could influence biting insects during the selection of an appropriate human host. This has never been investigated for biting midges, but some evidence exists in studies with mosquitoes. For example, some studies have shown that species of Anopheles (malaria mosquitoes) preferentially feed on adults rather than children [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Similarly, Michael et al. [13] demonstrated that the biting rates of Culex quinquefasciatus (the Southern house mosquito) had a positive association with age in children. It has also been shown that men are bitten more readily than women [10, 14] and that larger people are also bitten more often [11] . Additionally, it has been shown that women are more likely to be bitten when pregnant [15] . Other conflicting studies have indicated that certain mosquito species will feed randomly on individuals regardless of age, sex or size [11, 14, 16] . There is also evidence that the level of attractiveness to mosquitoes could be hereditary. For example, Kirk et al. [17] performed a survey on adolescent twins and demonstrated that there was a strong genetic influence on frequency of being bitten by mosquitoes in children between the ages of 12 and 14. Although there is anecdotal evidence for the association between certain lifestyle, health and demographic characteristics and level of attractiveness to midges, this has never been examined in detail. The aim of this study was to use, for the first time, a questionnairebased survey to investigate whether the above factors have any association with attraction to midges and reaction to midge bites. Methods The survey was completed by volunteers who were participants or spectators at a duathlon event (First Monster Challenge) held in Inverness, Scotland in September 2008. The cohort involved was thus fairly uniform with the majority of respondents being young, fit and healthy adults. All questionnaires were either distributed the evening before the event and collected the following day or handed out and collected on the day of the event. A structured self administered questionnaire survey, using both closed and open-ended questions, was developed to investigate details about the level of attractiveness to midges in Scotland and how this relates to other demographic, lifestyle and genetic factors. The questionnaire consisted of 28 questions in five sections: (1) demographics (including age, sex, height, weight and place of residence); (2) lifestyle/health; (3) perceived level of attractiveness to midges; (4) perceived level of attractiveness of their offspring (expressed as first child) to midges; (5) reproductive state (women only). For perceived level of attractiveness to midges, volunteers were asked "when in Scotland, in an area with midges, how often do you get bitten, when on your own?" and were given answer options of "never", "sometimes", "often" or "always". All other factors relating to demographics, lifestyle, etc were cross referenced to this question. Volunteers were also asked "when in Scotland, in an area with midges, how often do you get bitten, when you are with others?". The answers to this question were highly correlated with the answers to the question referring to when the volunteers were on their own, therefore, we have not included these results. Participants were also asked "when midges bite how do you react?" and were given four options "no reaction" (no mark on skin), "minor" (raised red mark that disappears quickly), "bad" (raised red itchy mark that lasts for a few days) and "very bad" (large red mark with blisters giving pain and itching). Again, factors relating to demographics and lifestyle, etc were cross referenced to this question. The study was approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (Ref 07/S0801/51). Statistical analysis Data for level of attractiveness (i.e. "never", "sometimes", "often" and "always") were combined to give two categories "never bitten" (category "never" only) and "bitten" (a combination of categories "sometimes", "often" and "always"). Data for reaction to bites ("no reaction", "minor", "bad" and "very bad") were combined to give three categories "no reaction", "minor" and "bad" (a combination of "bad" and "very bad"). Descriptive statistics were then performed on the data using GenStat (version 12.1.0.3412). Two-way cross tabulations were used to analyse associations between level of attractiveness and the following variables: age, sex, height, weight, BMI, place of residence, smoking habit, diet, allergies, exercise, medication intake (including oral contraceptives), alcohol consumption and menstrual cycle stage (women only). For this purpose, the continuous variables age, height, weight and BMI were grouped to form categorical variables. In these cases, category boundaries were chosen to be both easily interpretable and to give a reasonable spread of participants across categories. To determine whether susceptibility to being bitten by midges can be inherited, a cross tabulation was also done to investigate associations between level of attractiveness of parents and their children. A chi-square test of independence was done on all two-way tables and, due to small sample sizes for certain categories, p-values were generated from a permutation test using the method of Roff & Bentzen [18] . When the chi-square test indicated association between the variables, further models were fitted. Where one of the variables could be construed as a binary response, logistic regression was used to identify the categories where the response differed. Where all variables had more than two categories, multinomial models were fitted, and residuals from a model of conditional independence were used to identify categories contributing to the association. For the variables height, weight and BMI, where the distribution differed markedly between men and women, three-way tabulations were formed for the level of attractiveness ("never bitten" vs. "bitten") against both sexes and height, weight or BMI. Logistic regression was used to analyse these data, using height, weight or BMI as a continuous variable. Results Participant summary A total of 325 participants took part in this survey. The majority (66.2%) were male and most were within the 'under 31' or '31-40' age categories (30% and 33% respectively) and there was an equal age distribution across both sexes (p = 0.46). The majority of participants were fit and healthy with most people (76.9%) doing more than 3 hours of exercise per week and only 6.6% doing less than 1 hour per week. Forty five percent of males and 53% of females had a normal BMI (between 21 and 30). Most people lived in Scotland (71%) with the majority of these living in the west of the country (Table 1 ). Level of being bitten When the participants were asked the question "when in Scotland alone in an area with midges, how often are you bitten?" the majority (85.8%, n = 310) said they were bitten sometimes, often or always with only 14.2% claiming to never be bitten. When the participants were asked the question "when in Scotland in an area with midges with others, how often are you bitten?" the majority (88.4%, n = 303) said they were bitten sometimes, often or always with only 11.6% claiming to never be bitten. There was a very high association (p < 0.001) between the two questions, with only 9.2% (28 out of 303) participants giving different answers to the two questions. The data for other factors were then cross-referenced with the answers to the question "when in Scotland alone in an area with midges, how often are you bitten?". Because of possible variation in people's ability to accurately recall, we compared this with their actual perceived level of being bitten on the day of the survey when there were midges present and people were being bitten. There was a strong positive association between the level of being bitten usually compared with level of being bitten on that day (p < 0.001). There was a strong association between where people live and how much they report they are usually bitten (p = 0.004). The probability of being bitten was significantly greater for people living in west Scotland and significantly less for those living in England (Table 2 ). Logistic regression relating the probability of (reporting) being bitten to sex and height showed strong evidence that the probability of being bitten increased with height for men (p = 0.006, n = 305; Figure 1 ) but not for women. The predicted probability of being bitten for men at the 10 th (170.7 cm) and 90 th (188 cm) sample percentiles of height distribution are 0.7 (SE 0.05) and 0.92 (SE 0.26). Weight showed no relationship to the probability of being bitten (p = 0.79, n = 300). However, there was evidence that the probability of being bitten increased with BMI for women (p = 0.050, n = 296) but not for men. The predicted probability of usually being bitten in Scotland for females at 10 th (19.42) and 90 th (27.90) sample percentiles of BMI distribution are 0.77 (SE 0.072) and 0.96 (SE 0.02) respectively (Figure 1 ). There was a strong interaction between the frequency of bites the first child receives and how often the parent is usually bitten (p < 0.001, n = 146). Logistic regression showed that the probability of the first child not being bitten by midges was much higher if the parent also claimed to be usually not bitten (p < 0.001). There was no evidence that the sex of the parent had an effect on the rate of biting on the child (p = 0.11) (Figure 2 ). There was insufficient variation in the responses to reliably assess association between ethnic origin, general diet, medication or illness and whether people are bitten or not bitten by midges. There was no significant association between age, sex, smoking, exercise, eating strongly flavoured foods (e.g. garlic, chilli and onions), frequency and amount of alcohol consumption and whether people are bitten or not bitten by midges (p > 0.05). In women there was no evidence for an interaction between level of biting and the reproductive status (i.e. premenopausal, menopausal or postmenopausal) (p = 0.99, n = 62), whether the respondents were taking oral contraceptives (p = 0.44, n = 91), or the stage of the menstrual cycle (p = 1.00, n = 51). There was some evidence of a significant association with allergy to insect bites and being bitten (p = 0.05, n = 310), due to a high proportion of people with insect allergy reporting that they are "always bitten" when in Scotland. This association disappears (p = 0.99) for the binary (not bitten vs. bitten) response. Level of reaction to bites For participants' reported reactions to midge bites, data in the "bad" and "very bad" categories were combined in the analysis because there were only 11 responses in the "very bad" category (3.6%, n = 305). The majority of people (53.1%) reported a minor reaction and 33.8% reported a bad reaction. Only 13.1% claimed that they have no reaction to midge bites. There was a strong association between the frequency of being bitten and the reaction to bites with most people who report reacting badly to bites also receiving high numbers of bites and with those who do not react badly claiming they never get bitten (p < 0.001, Figure 3 ). There was no correlation between age and reaction to bites (p = 0.46, n = 305). However, there was a significant association of reaction to bites in relation to sex (p = 0.005), which was caused by women having a significantly higher probability of reporting a bad reaction to midge bites (p = 0.01) (Figure 4 ). There was no association between residence (p = 0.37, n = 292), eating strongly flavoured foods (e.g. chilli, garlic, onions, p = 0.14, n = 300) or the frequency (p = 0.70, n = 301) and amount (p = 0.36, n = 303) of alcohol ingestion, reproductive status (p = 0.18, n = 61), contraceptive usage (p = 0.86, n = 90) or menstrual stage (p = 0.94, n = 52) and reaction to midge-bites. Neither smoking (p = 0.27, n = 304) or allergies (including allergies to animals, antibiotics, food, hay fever and pollen) had any effect on reaction to bites either amalgamated (p = 0.98, n = 304) or individually. However, there was a significant association between people reporting an allergy to insects and their reaction to bites, with people with an insect allergy reacting more badly to bites than those without (p = 0.03, n = 305), as would be expected. There was also a significant association between exercise and reaction to midge bites (p = 0.04, n = 303). A multinomial model indicated that people doing the least exercise (less than one hour per week) and most exercise (more than 4 hours) were more likely to have no reaction to midge bites than people who do between 1 and 4 hours of exercise per week. Logistic regression showed no significant interaction between level of reaction and height (p = 0.59, n = 300), weight (p = 0.74, n = 296) or BMI (p = 0.18, n = 292) (when differences due to sex had been accounted for). Discussion Despite the vast amount of anecdotal evidence surrounding why some people get bitten more than others by blood-feeding insects, few studies have investigated the demographic, lifestyle and health factors involved. This is the largest investigation of its type for any biting insect. Our finding that only 14.2% of people claim to never be bitten is the first measurement of differential attraction to biting insects using a large sample size. To our knowledge this is the first reported statistic of the prevalence of the trait for being "unattractive" to biting insects and supports our previous work on mosquitoes and midges on much smaller sample sizes when directly measuring attractiveness and odour profiles of individuals [4, 19] . It is well known that the west coast of Scotland is an area of high midge populations and, therefore, it was expected to find that people who claim they are bitten at home the most indeed lived in the west of Scotland. This geographic region provides a unique environment which allows the Scottish biting midge to thrive successfully [3] . Our study is the first to show an association between body size and attractiveness to biting midges. The preference for biting people of a greater height could be associated with midge behaviour and flight patterns. For example, Venter et al. [20] demonstrated, using light traps, that most midges are caught at a height of 2.8 metres above ground level. Midges are also known to rest in trees after they have emerged from pupae and are found in greater numbers with increasing height (in particular from 1-4 metres) [21] . It is, therefore, possible that midges searching for a suitable host would be descending from above and would encounter taller people, within in a group, first. Additionally, larger people would provide a more substantial visual target for hostseeking midges as well as greater amounts of heat, moisture and attractant semiochemicals (behaviour modifying chemicals), such as carbon dioxide, which are all involved in the location of a suitable blood meal. These findings are also supported by similar studies with mosquitoes. For example, Port et al. [11] demonstrated that larger people are bitten more often by certain mosquito species. Similarly, men have been shown to be bitten more readily than women in previous studies, however, whether this is due to true differences between the sexes (a pattern not found here) or due to differences in body size is unknown [10, 14, 22] . Some investigations have provided evidence that certain mosquito species will preferentially feed on adults rather than children [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Similarly, Michael et al. [13] demonstrated that biting rates of Culex species mosquitoes had a positive association with age in children. In this study, the participants were adults so we could not assess whether there is a difference between children and adults. However, we did not find any association of age with the level of being bitten by midges. There is a reported link between alcohol ingestion and attractiveness to biting insects suggesting that people who drink alcohol are more attractive to mosquitoes [23, 24] . Anecdotal evidence for this certainly exists in relation to midges, however, in our study we found no such association. There was also no association between being bitten and the consumption of strongly flavoured foods (e.g. garlic, chilli and onions). This is contrary to popular belief as people commonly believe that garlic, in particular, makes you less attractive to biting insects. In support of our findings, Rajan et al. [25] found no effect of garlic consumption on how many mosquito bites were received in laboratory trials. There is also much speculation that other factors such as smoking, exercise, diet and reproductive stage can be related to whether people are bitten or not bitten by midges [26] . However, no such associations were found in this study. This suggests that these factors do not influence the cues used by midges during their search for a potential blood meal. The interaction between the frequency of bites the first child receives and how often the parent is usually bitten suggests that the factor that makes someone attractive or unattractive to midges may be hereditary   and could be controlled genetically. Kirk et al. [17] performed a survey on adolescent twins and also suggested that there was a strong genetic influence on frequency of being bitten by mosquitoes of children of certain ages. Other studies have shown that odours of twins are similar and thus may indicate the importance of genetic makeup on body odour [27] . Logan et al. [4, 19] demonstrated that the reason some people are bitten less by mosquitoes and midges is due to the production of repellent chemicals in their body odour. Therefore, it is plausible that the biosynthesis or release of such natural repellents is under genetic control and is hereditary [26] . Although differences in parental awareness of bites received by their children may also play a role here, there appears to be growing evidence that the level of attractiveness to biting insects is under genetic control. We are currently investigating further the possible genetic control of attractiveness to biting insects in molecular studies in our laboratories. For the first time we also report the proportion of people who claim to react differently to bites from midges and our results suggest that, despite the immense annoyance factor caused by these insects, the majority of people sustain a minor reaction whilst 33% report having a bad reaction. Those that report having no reaction to midge bites are in the minority with a strong association between the frequency of being bitten and the reaction to bites. This may be a direct association with number of bites received (e.g. the more bites received, the higher the level of perceived reaction) or it may indicate that there is an indirect link between level of attractiveness and level of reaction, that does not relate to the number of bites received. Indeed the severity of cutaneous reactions to insect bites is known to differ between individuals and, therefore, there could be an association [28, 29] . Additionally, other studies have shown that people's perception of how attractive they are (in a questionnaire) matches well with their accurately measured level of attractiveness to mosquitoes in the laboratory [4, 19, 26] . However, no study has ever investigated this link and we cannot make definitive conclusions from our own study. Nevertheless, it does suggest that people's perception of how attractive they are to mosquitoes could be influenced by their reaction to the bites they receive rather than the number of bites. In support of this, Read et al. and Peng et al. [30, 31] also demonstrated a lower than expected correlation between reported bites of volunteers and the number of mosquitoes caught in traps using their body odours in a public perception of mosquito annoyance survey. In our study we found a significant association of reaction to midge bites in relation to sex, which was seen in women having a significantly higher probability of a bad reaction to midge bites than men. Women may experience a greater reaction to midge bites or may have a greater awareness of bites received. Further sensitivity studies would need to be done to confirm this result, although other studies have also suggested, by measuring the level of mosquito saliva-specific antibodies in infants, that there may be similar differences between the sexes in terms of their reaction to bites from insects [32] . The study is not without limitations as our respondents were participants, spectators and organisers of a duathlon event and consequently the majority of respondents were young, fit and healthy. Additionally, it relied on subjective answers from volunteers rather than experimental measurement of level of attractiveness of the participants. However, measurement of every individual would have been logistically impossible. The data have been analysed using the answers to the questions "how often are you usually bitten when in Scotland?". Because of possible variation in people's ability to accurately remember, we compared this with their perceived level of being bitten on the day of the survey when there when people were being bitten and we found a strong positive association. We also have evidence from previous investigations that the perceived level of being bitten by biting insects is directly correlated to their actual level of "attractiveness" when measured accurately using a laboratory-based behavioural experiment with mosquitoes. Additionally, we have previously demonstrated that the level of attractiveness to midges is reflected in the response of mosquitoes to the same people, indicating that the results of this study could be extrapolated to instances where people are bitten by mosquitoes, including those that vector pathogens [4, 19] . Conclusions In summary, we found that 14% of people do not attract midges and only a small proportion report no reaction to midge bites. This study suggests that midges prefer to bite men that are tall and women that have a large BMI, and that the tendency for a child to be bitten or not could be inherited from their parent. Also, women tend to react more than men to midge bites. Contrary to common belief diet, health and other lifestyle factors do not play a role in making people more or less attractive to midges. The study is questionnairebased; therefore, the interpretation of the results may be limited by the subjectivity of the answers given by the respondents. Although the results are relevant only to the Scottish biting midge, the approach used here could be useful for investigating human-insect interactions for other insects, particularly those which transmit pathogens.

Online 'at-a-glance' summary Bulleted summary In contrast to the traditional idea that the processing of visual information consists of a sequence of feedforward operations, with neuronal functional properties taking on increasing complexity as one progresses through a hierarchy of cortical areas, increasing evidence points towards a reverse process, with higher order cognitive influences interacting with information coming from the retina. As a consequence, one must incorporate the following principles in thinking of the brain mechanisms of information processing: • Rather than having a fixed functional role, neurons are adaptive processors, changing their function according to behavioral context. • Vision is an active process, where higher order cognitive influences affect the operations performed by cortical neurons. • Visual pathways operate bidirectionally, with each feedforward connection matched by a feedback or reentrant connections going from higher to lower order cortical areas. • Top-down influences include various forms of attention, including spatial, object oriented and feature oriented attention. • Top-down influences are not limited to attention but mediate a much broader range of functional roles, including perceptual task, object expectation, scene segmentation, efference copy, working memory, and the encoding and recall of learned information. • The effect of top-down influences is to change the information conveyed by neurons, both by alteration of the tuning of their responses to stimulus attributes and by changing the structure of correlations over neuronal ensembles. • All areas of the visual pathway, except for the retina, are subject to top-down influences, including early cortical stages of visual processing such as the primary visual cortex and the lateral geniculate nucleus, and all areas along the dorsal and ventral visual cortical pathways. Each area contains an association field of potential interactions, and expresses a subset of these interactions to execute different functions. • The sources of top-down influences are widespread, with each area providing information reflecting the functional properties of that area. As a consequence, even a single neuron can be viewed as a microcosm of activity occurring throughout the visual pathway.. • We propose that the circuit mechanism of top-down control and adaptive processing involves a gating of intrinsic cortical circuits within an area mediated by long range feedback connections to that area. By selecting a subset of inputs, a neuron can express different components of its association field, and as a result take on different functional roles. The functional properties of cortical neurons are not fixed. Rather, they can be thought of as adaptive processors, changing their function according to the behavioral context, and their responses reflect the demands of the perceptual task being performed. Cortical neurons are subject to top-down influences of attention, expectation and perceptual task. "Top-down" refers to cognitive influences and higher order representations that impinge upon earlier steps in information processing. Such influences represent a reversal of the central dogma of sensory information processing, which is based on feedforward connections along a hierarchy of cortical areas representing progressively more complex aspects of the visual scene. But superimposed on the feedforward pathways there are reentrant or feedback pathways that convey higher order information to antecedent cortical areas. The top-down signal carries a rich amount of information that facilitates the interpretation of the visual scene and that enables the visual system to build a stable representation of the objects within it, despite rapid and continuous eye movements. It facilitates our ability to segment the complex arrangement of multiple objects and backgrounds in the visual scene. In addition, the top-down signal plays a role in the encoding and recall of learned information. The resulting feedforward signals carried by neurons convey different meanings about the same visual scene according to the behavioral context. This idea is in stark contrast with the classical notion of a hierarchy of visual cortical areas --where information is conveyed in a feedforward fashion to progressively higher levels in the hierarchy, beginning with the analysis of simple attributes such as contrast and orientation, and leading to more complex functional properties from one stage to the next --and implies that vision is an active process. As we analyze visual scenes we set up countercurrent streams of processing, with the resulting percept reflecting the set of functional states of all the areas in the visual cortical hierarchy. In this review we consider the receptive field properties that are subject to top-down influences, the nature of the information that is conveyed by reentrant pathways, and how the information carried by neurons depends on behavioral context. Over longer time periods receptive fields can change to accommodate alterations in visual experience. These lines of evidence point towards an evolving view of the nature of the receptive field, which includes contextual influences and emphasizes its dynamic nature, with neurons taking on different properties in response to experience and expectation. Top-down influences are conveyed across a series of descending pathways covering the entire neocortex and are relayed through thalamic nuclei (Figure 1 ). The feedforward connections define a hierarchy of visual cortical areas, beginning with primary visual cortex (V1) and ascending through two primary pathways, a ventral pathway, which is involved with object recognition, and a dorsal pathway, which is involved with visually guided movements and attentional control. For every feedforward connection there is a reciprocal feedback connection that carries information about the behavioral context. The Receptive Field Top-down influences take into account the nature of stimulus dependent properties in any sensory cortical area. There is an emerging view that in the early stages of visual cortical processing, rather than doing a local analysis of simple features, neurons can integrate information over large parts of the visual field, and that neurons in these areas can show selectivity for complex stimulus configurations. The integrative properties of cortical neurons are reflected in their selectivity for stimulus context. Contextual influences refer to the ways by which the perceptual qualities of a local feature are affected by surrounding scene elements and the way in which global scene characteristics affect the responses of neurons to local features. They play important roles in perceptual grouping, perceptual constancies, contour integration, surface segmentation and shape recognition. The most profound effects of top-down control are exerted on contextual influences. This has led to a change in our thinking about the role and prevalence of top-down influences across the visual cortical hierarchy, from initial studies suggesting that they are negligible at early stages of cortical processing to current studies showing substantial changes in neural responses with shifts in attention, with expectation and perceptual task. Understanding how such cognitive influences affect neuronal function requires understanding the character of the receptive field. The visual receptive field is the part of the retina where a stimulus can cause the neuron to respond with a train of action potentials. The characterization of the receptive field is dependent on the nature of the stimulus used to measure it. A simple stimulus, such as an oriented line segment, will activate a neuron over a small part of the visual field (known as the "minimum response field", which for superficial layer V1 parafoveal receptive fields is in the order of 0.5° in diameter), but similar stimuli outside this area, which by themselves will not activate the neuron, can greatly affect the neuron's response when presented jointly with a stimulus in the centre of the receptive field. These modulatory influences can be either facilitatory or inhibitory, and the direction and size of the effect depends on the position of the flanking stimulus relative to the receptive field core 1 . As a consequence, neurons' responses are as dependent on the characteristics of global contours and surfaces as they are on the attributes of local features within the minimum response field, and these contextual influences can extend over relatively large regions of the visual field. Contextual influences in areas V1 and V2 have been implicated in intermediate level vision, including contour integration (the assembly of contour elements into global shapes) and surface segmentation (the separation between object surfaces and their backgrounds) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The extent of these contextual influences varies according to the level of stimulus complexity and attentional state 9 . One has to keep contextual influences in mind when considering the role of top-down influences in altering a neuron's response properties. The function of a neuron is also characterized by its tuning to a range of stimuli, such as different line orientations, directions of movement or colors. One can extend this to any stimulus space and determine the responsiveness of a neuron to stimuli in different points within that space. This has been applied to determine a neuron's selectivity for the shapes of complex objects or for the configuration of complex stimuli consisting of multiple line segments. Beyond examining the shape of a neuron's tuning, one can use other measures to characterize a neuron's stimulus selectivity and to relate that selectivity to perception 10 . One is mutual information -the degree to which a neuron's response predicts stimulus identity, quantified in bits. Another is ideal observer analysis, which allows one to relate a neuron's discriminability in a stimulus space, its "neurometric" curve, or to the animal's discrimination performance, its "psychometric" curve. Top-down influences also affect these measures of neuronal function, and as a result, change the nature of the information that neurons convey. The cortical source and circuitry underlying contextual influences have been vigorously debated 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . We have proposed that long range intrinsic cortical connections provide a substrate for interactions across the visual field, and have a spatial extent and columnar specificity that is consistent with the contextual influences and with the Gestalt rules of perceptual grouping 5, 11, 12, 14 . Some have argued that these influences originate from higher order cortical areas, based on their timing relative to stimulus onset. It is not clear that timing is a reliable indicator of the source of a signal given the fast conduction velocities of feedback projections. An alternative explanation is that a signal delay is due to the time required for the network to shift from one stable state to another, with foreground and background interactions requiring time to evolve 18 . Delayed influences have been seen with stimuli involving texture segmentation and contour saliency 5, 19 , but for stimulus configurations without complex backgrounds contextual effects have been observed from the onset of responses 20 (see Figure 2 ). The nature of top-down influences and their effect on receptive field properties Top-down influences include different forms, such as attention, expectation and perceptual task. They are seen at all stages in the visual hierarchy, including primary visual cortex, and reaching as far back as the lateral geniculate nucleus 21, 22 . The effect of these influences is to alter receptive field properties and the information carried by neural ensembles. As a consequence, vision can be thought of as an active process, requiring expectation or hypothesis testing in order to interpret the visual scene. Some contextual influences have been proposed to arise from a predictive coding strategy, where higher levels in the cortical hierarchy make predictions about lower-level activity, and some neurons carry an error signal between the prediction and the stimulus generated activity 23, 24 . Top-down influences assume a number of forms, and there is a rich amount of information conveyed from higher order to lower order areas: Spatial attention Top-down control is traditionally associated with spatial attention. Its effect has largely been characterized in terms of gain control-enhancement of neural responses -as well as suppression of responses outside of the focus of attention 25, 26 . The utility of spatial attention is to allow us to select behaviorally relevant stimuli and to analyze specific parts of the visual field 27 . The consequent enhancement of neural responses is seen in a number of cortical areas, including V1, V2, V4, MT and IT 5, 26, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] and it provides a mechanism for selection of behaviorally relevant stimuli from competing distracters 41 . While earlier studies have suggested that higher order visual areas in the cortical hierarchy are more subject to attentional influences than earlier stages 42 , the magnitude of attentional effects is highly dependent on the nature of the task and the configuration of the stimulus 20, 26, 35, 38, [43] [44] [45] [46] . Attentional effects are more profound when there is competition between multiple stimuli 26, 45 . In V1, this is when contextual influences are involved 5, 26, 35, 38, 47 . One should therefore consider the effects of attention on lateral interactions, instead of their influence on feedforward properties such as the orientation of a line segment. For example, two collinear lines, one inside and one outside the receptive field, will produce a stronger response relative to that elicited by a single line centered within the receptive field. This facilitation depends on whether the lines are at an attended location and on the discrimination task performed at that location, resulting in several-fold differences between responses obtained with "attend to" and "attend away" conditions 35 . Attentional influences become more evident with increasing stimulus complexity 26 and depend on the precise geometric relationships between stimulus components 5 . Object oriented and feature oriented attention Rather than acting as a 'searchlight', attention can highlight discriminability of features belonging to the same object (object oriented attention), or components sharing similar properties (feature oriented attention), such as color, orientation or direction of movement. Feature based attention highlights the components of a scene sharing the same attribute, and distributes cognitive resources broadly across the visual scene, rather than the restricted spotlight of spatial attention 31, [48] [49] [50] . The effect may be specific to cortical areas that deal with the attended feature, such as color in area V4, direction of movement in area MT [50] [51] [52] [53] or with the attended object, such as the fusiform face area or parahippocampal place area 54 . Object oriented attention increases the perceptual saliency of the components of an entire object, rather than the features incorporated within a fixed spotlight. Attending to an object encompasses all the features belonging to the object 3, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] , and as measured with fMRI, the cortical effects of attention to a feature can spread throughout the visual field, even to regions lacking a visual stimulus 62, 63 . The Gestalt psychology movement recognized the importance of the whole influencing the perceptual quality of the parts, essentially reversing the direction of information flow whereby the representation of the object precedes the representation of its components 64 . Object expectation may play an important role in the segmentation of the visual scene. Because of the complexity of the visual environment, the most difficult task of object recognition is not the identification of an object but the association of the contour elements and surfaces belonging to the object and separating these from the object's background. Thus, while object recognition itself can, in theory, be accomplished by feedforward mechanisms alone 65 , top-down processes, or a "countercurrent stream" of information flow, is required for proper scene segmentation 66 where objects have to be identified in complex scenes consisting of many objects. Models that incorporate recurrent processing can help to resolve an extremely challenging task for the visual system: grouping and segmenting elements within the visual scene. Perceptual task Even when attending to the same location and receiving an identical stimulus, the tuning of neurons can change according to the perceptual task that is being performed. This form of top-down control allows the network to engage stimulus components that are relevant to the task, and to discard influences from components that are irrelevant to the task. The task dependent change in tuning of neurons can be analyzed in terms of a change in task relevant information in neuronal signalling. This implies that the functional roles of neurons are not fixed, but instead that they are adaptive processors, running different programmes in differing behavioral contexts. By changing the perceptual task based on the same visual stimulus, one sees responses that are influenced by different stimulus components 20 . As shown in Figure 2 , when presenting a central target line flanked by 2 parallel lines and 2 collinear lines, animals can perform either a 3-line bisection task based on the parallel lines or a vernier discrimination task based on the collinear lines. Neurons change their tuning according to the task being performed, showing more modulation to changes in position of the task relevant components (the parallel lines when performing the 3-line bisection task, or the collinear lines when performing the vernier discrimination task) than to changes in position of the task irrelevant stimulus components. Another example of this task dependency is in a curve tracing task, in which responses are enhanced for neurons with receptive fields lying along the attended than along the unattended contour 3 . A task involving detection of a contour in a complex background enhances the contour related facilitation in responses of V1 neurons. The perceptual saliency, or detectability, of such a contour increases with the number of collinear line segments, and this correlates with the increase in neuronal responses as the contour is lengthened. The facilitatory influence of the collinear line segments is much larger when the animal performs a contour detection task than when it carries out an unrelated task 5 . Although we emphasize the specificity of the task in generating the enhanced neural responses, one might think that these observations fall under the rubric of object oriented attention. Regardless of whether one calls this object-oriented attention or a task-dependent top-down influence, it is important to emphasize that the effect is to cause neurons to change their tuning to the characteristics of the stimuli within the area of visual space that is attended. Recent electrophysiological studies have suggested that the frontal eye field is the cortical locus for attentional selection of a target among distracters 67, 68 . Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human frontal eye field has shown that the back propagation of the induced signals from the prefrontal cortex to visual areas is dependent on the task being performed on a given stimulus, reflecting task-specific modulatory effects of expectation 69 . Anatomical studies have also shown segregated pathways projecting from frontal cortex to area V4 and MT, which may carry different top-down signals for processing different stimulus features 70 . The idea that neurons multiplex their function in a task-dependent fashion, that is, at different times they select one out of a battery of functional properties, may be general to all areas of the cerebral cortex (for the auditory cortex 71 ). Recordings in prefrontal cortex have demonstrated that neurons can be tuned to multiple categorical distinctions, so that the same neuron can exhibit different categorical representations as the task changes 72 (Figure 3 ). Establishing the generality of this phenomenon to other areas depends on using an experimental design in which neurons' selectivities are measured under different behavioral contexts. This is described in the following section, where neurons' shape selectivity is determined while animals are searching for different shapes. Object expectation When animals are cued to look for a specific shape, the shape selectivity of neurons in V1 changes to a form that approximates the cued shape or a portion of that shape. Evidence in support of object expectation in producing selectivity for specific geometric forms comes from an experiment in which animals were trained to identify a cued contour embedded in a complex environment. The cue consisted either of a straight line, a circle or a wave shape. The shape selectivity of V1 neurons was measured before the correct and false targets were presented in complex backgrounds in either hemifield, at which time the animal made a saccade towards the correct target. The important finding of this experiment was first, that neurons in V1 showed selectivity for complex shape geometries (not just single oriented line segments), and second, that this selectivity could be altered, for individual neurons and for the population of superficial layer neurons as a whole, by changing shape expectation 8 . This process suggests that expectation of an object creates a set of filters that are selective for the object's components and thus, a role of top-down processes in object recognition 73 . The idea is further supported by the transfer of perceptual learning between objects with shared components 74 . These experiments demonstrate that even at the earliest stages in visual cortical processing neurons are selective for more complex geometries than single oriented line segments, and that their shape selectivity depends on object expectation. In effect, neurons become selective for components of expected objects, and object recognition involves a countercurrent stream of processing, with top down anticipatory influences dynamically creating the appropriate set of lower level filters, and the feedforward connections from these filters collectively creating the representation of the full object. This emerging view contrasts with the dogma of hierarchical, bottom-up visual processing. Efference copy We see the world as stable, even as our eyes scan the visual scene, causing movement of scene features across our retinas. This is because a copy of the motor instruction to execute an eye movement, known as the efference copy or corollary discharge, is sent to the sensory apparatus to "subtract" the movement signal, thereby cancelling out any sensation of object movement due to eye movement. In the last few years the efference copy pathway, involving the superior colliculus, the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus and frontal eye fields, has been elucidated 75, 76 . The effect of this signal is to shift receptive field position (for neurons in the parietal cortex) in the direction of the eye movement 77 . An alternative mechanism for perceptual stability is one involving a predictive mapping of attention to selected targets 78 , although the shift in the locus activation of neurons is nonetheless powerful evidence of top-down influence on receptive field properties based on motor plan. Shifting cortical receptive fields in anticipation of eye movements has been seen in areas of parietal cortex and frontal eye fields [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] . Thus, for some neurons, even the property of receptive field location is not fixed, and shifting receptive fields plays a valuable role in perceptual stability. Working memory, associative memory and perceptual learning The way a cortical area responds to a stimulus depends on prior experience and current task. An excellent example of this is one in which animals were trained to associate a pattern of moving dots with a stationary arrow. Ordinarily neurons in area MT respond to stimuli moving in a particular direction and are not responsive to stationary stimuli. But in animals trained in this associative task, MT neurons respond well to the stationary stimulus, indicating that their activity reflects not just the external stimulus but also cognitive state, visual imagery and stimulus associations 85 (Figure 4 ). Another example is where neurons in frontal eye fields retain "memory responses" in the absence of a visual stimulus but represent locations of intended saccades, that is, they respond to stimuli located in positions where the receptive field will be at the end of the saccade 86 , or the target of attentional selection 87 . Longer term influences of learning, in particular perceptual learning, have been shown to alter response properties as early as V1 (for review see Gilbert and Li, 2012 13 ). Although perceptual learning is outside the scope of this review, top-down influences play an important role in its mechanism. They are required for the encoding of the learned information as well as in its recall, as the neuronal properties associated with learning are only present when the animal is performing the trained task 6, 20, 38 . Dynamic encoding of information at the network level A useful way to think about the effect of top-down influences is in terms of the information they convey and impart upon their target neurons. Information theory provides a measure of the extent an ideal observer can categorize a stimulus based on the spike count from a recorded neuron during one trial. Top-down influences affect neuronal tuning in a way that enables neurons to carry more information about the stimulus being discriminated. Neurons can increase the degree of modulation of their responses over a set of stimuli, making these responses more informative about stimulus identity. The idea that a neuron is an adaptive processor, changing the calculation it performs in accordance to the top-down instruction received from higher order cortical areas, has attendant with it that the neuron's line label is not fixed. The line label idea suggests that when a neuron fires it is signaling the presence of a stimulus possessing the neuron's preferred attribute (orientation preference, for example), and the strength of its firing indicates the closeness of the stimulus to that attribute. But if the top-down signal causes neurons to change the meaning of the information they carry, then these neurons are effectively changing their line label. How can this not distort the analysis of the visual image if neurons are constantly changing their function? The answer lies in the fact that the higher order areas sent the instruction for these neurons to perform a particular calculation, so the return signal is "interpreted" by these areas as the result of that calculation, and is not confused with other operations those neurons perform. Beyond the effect of top-down influences on the functional properties of individual neurons, neuronal ensembles can be induced to carry more information by altering their correlation structure, that is, the spatial and temporal distribution of correlated activity over the network of neurons within and across cortical areas. Neurons are variable in their responses to a given stimulus, and as more neurons participate in encoding the stimulus, the variability can be averaged out to provide better signal to noise ratios. But this depends on the ability of neurons to be independent from one another. The optimal information content would require zero or low noise correlations. There is, however, a significant amount of noise correlation [88] [89] [90] [91] , so a decrease in noise correlations induced by top-down influences would increase the amount of information encoded by the neuronal ensemble [92] [93] [94] [95] . Decorrelation in the trial to trial variability of responses can allow groups of neurons to average out this variability and improve the signal to noise ratio. This benefit depends on whether neurons are similarly tuned as noise correlation between differently tuned neurons can increase coding efficiency 92, 93, 96 . Attention and perceptual learning have been shown to reduce noise correlations, although this has been an area of some debate [97] [98] [99] [100] . Even more task-specific effects are seen on noise correlations between cortical sites that are relevant to the task being performed, and these changes are larger than those associated with merely attending to the stimulus 101 . In area MT, noise correlations between a pair of neurons receiving identical visual stimuli can either increase or decrease depending on which of two orthogonal axes the monkey is cued to perform a motion detection task 102 . Top-down influences go well beyond specifying the locus of spatial attention and changing neuronal firing rates. The recurrent pathways that convey these influences must be capable of conveying much more information than a locus to be attended. By the same token, topdown influences cause neurons at the antecedent stages in the cortical hierarchy to alter the nature of the information in their signals. This is not simply a matter of gain control, but involves alterations in tuning that enable neurons to carry more information about stimulus components that are relevant to the task at hand, to take on selectivity for features that are components of expected objects, and to maintain a stable representation of the world in the face of continual eye movements. The increase in task relevant information is contributed in part by the changes in tuning of individual neurons and in part by the change in the structure of correlations across the neuronal ensemble. Different forms of top-down influences have been documented in different cortical areas, and these effects are relevant to the functional properties of these areas. But all cortical areas, and even the thalamus, can exhibit profound top-down influences. Based on early findings on the lack of attentional effects in V1, along with findings of strong effects in V4 and MT, it has been suggested that attentional influences get progressively stronger along the visual pathway 42 . However, more recent findings, based on more complex stimuli and behavioral paradigms, have called this idea into question, and have suggested that all areas in the hierarchy are equally subject to top-down influences. It is becoming increasingly evident that attention effects are seen early in the visual pathway 21, 22, 26, 35, 43, 44, 46, 103 . The way in which these influences are manifest depends on the functional role of each cortical area: contour integration in V1, responses to movement direction in MT, modulation by eye position in parietal areas, and so on. Circuit mechanisms of top-down control Many studies on top-down influences have focused on the enhancement or change in gain of responses induced by attention, which is equivalent to the stimulus being increased in contrast 50, 52, 104, 105 . The influence of attention on stimuli within the receptive field has been described in the 'biased competition' model 41 . In this model objects in the visual field compete for computing resources, and an object can "win" on the strength of its saliency ("bottom up" attention or pop-out) or behavioral relevance (top-down control). Related to the idea of biased competition is a normalization model of attention, which involves a multiplicative scaling of responses to multiple stimuli in the receptive field, and attention affects the strength of the normalization 106, 107 . These models assume that attention does not affect the stimulus selectivity of neurons. But top-down influences can alter the information carried in neuronal signals, which is distinct from a gain control. For example, changes in a neuron's tuning to the specific components of the stimulus that are relevant to the task being performed have been observed 20, 38 , rather than a generalized increase in response to attended stimuli. Attention can change stimulus selectivity in addition to changing gain of responses 108 . It is therefore useful to have a model that can account for the specificity of top-down influences for different contextual components and for a neuron's ability to select a subset among all its inputs in order to exhibit different functional properties. According to this model, although a neuron receives thousands of inputs from intrinsic connections, only a fraction of these are expressed under a particular behavioral context. Interactions between reentrant connections from higher order cortical areas and intrinsic circuits enable the network to gate the connections that are appropriate for the task at hand, with different functional networks operating under different task conditions. As a consequence neurons multiplex their function in a state-dependent manner, and constitute adaptive processors running different operations under the instruction of feedback from higher order cortical areas 109 . The contextual influences that mediate higher order, complex receptive field properties in V1 involve lateral interactions across a topographically organized region, and they have the consequence of perceptual grouping, such as that involved with linking line segments to global contours. The interactions follow precise geometric rules, showing facilitatory influences for neurons with receptive fields lying along collinear or cocircular contours. This mode of interaction is known as the "association field" 110 . This is a general entity that has been identified in V1, but that is likely to have an analog in all cortical areas. The idea underlying the association field is a linkage between elements that are systematically represented, topographically, over each cortical area. Lateral interactions between these elements allow perceptual linkage or association of pieces of information. The lateral interactions may be mediated by a plexus of long-range horizontal connections within V1. These connections are formed by pyramidal neurons, whose axons extend for long distances parallel to the cortical surface, and link neurons with widely separated receptive fields 11, 14, [111] [112] [113] [114] . Because of their extent and columnar specificity (they connect neurons of similar orientation preference 11, 14, 115, 116 ), they are ideal conveyors of the contextual influences that enable contour integration 12 . Although the horizontal connections provide an anatomical framework for a range of contextual interactions, the observation that these interactions are subject to top-down control suggests that feedback signals can alter the effective connectivity of horizontal connections. We have proposed that reentrant inputs dynamically modify intrinsic cortical connections, allowing the appropriate associations to be made under different behavioral contexts. A possible reason for the existence of horizontal connections is that they allow such changes in connectivity within the network, as opposed to each cell having a large receptive field generated by a fixed set of feedforward connections. This idea has been implemented in models of cortical circuitry, in which changes in the gain of horizontal connections by feedback allows subsets of neuronal inputs to be selectively expressed 18 . It also accounts for the time course of contextual interactions, where delayed components of neuronal responses are due to the time required for the network to move from one stable state to another, rather than a function of the conduction time required to get information from a distant, more central source. Finally, it provides a mechanism for contour integration and saliency 18 . The interaction between feedback and horizontal connections also suggests a mechanism for perceptual learning. During the encoding of learned information the recurrent input acquires the appropriate mapping to intrinsic connections, and during the recall of the learned information this relationship allows the appropriate inputs to be gated and the target neuron to assume the appropriate functional properties. In V1 the association field mediates contour integration and saliency, and the top-down input allows for sub-components of the association field to be gated, leading to the manifestation of different shape selectivities. In other areas the association field would be defined by the properties and the kind of information that are topographically mapped in that area, and by the relationship between the long range horizontal connections and that map. Many of the task and expectation dependent effects described above can be explained by an input selection mechanism. By selecting components of the association field, neurons can express contextual influences that are relevant to the task being performed. A contour detection task enhances collinear interactions and suppresses influences from non collinear elements in the background 5 . A shape discrimination task induces neurons to select collinear influences when the cue is a line and cocircular influences when the cue is a circle 8 . By selection of components of the association field over multiple nodes in the horizontal network, neurons in V1 can take on selectivity for complex shapes, including wave like shapes with reversals in curvature. The selective influence of parallel lines in a 3-line bisection task and collinear lines in a vernier discrimination task 20 can be mediated by changing the effective connectivity of task relevant inputs. This idea is supported by an experiment involving recording from an array of electrodes, where the interactions between cortical sites are measured by cross-correlation analysis (based on the relative timing of spikes between pairs of neurons) or coherence between local field potentials (LFPs) measured at different sites. Changing the perceptual task with the identical visual stimulus strongly influences correlation strength. Perceptual grouping tasks enhance LFP coherence between parallel sites in 3-line bisection, and between collinear sites in contour detection. Perceptual segregation decreases LFP coherence between collinear sites as seen in a vernier discrimination task 101 (Figure 5 ). This is similar to the expectation-dependent changes seen in noise correlations 102 . Although some measures of coherence suggest that attention decreases cortical interactions 117 , the effect of top-down influences depends on the nature of the task and the way in which different cortical sites are engaged in the task. Further support of this idea comes from fMRI measures of coupling between distant cortical sites representing separated stimuli in a task requiring integration of the two stimuli 118 . Changes in effective connectivity mediated by top-down influences relates to the idea that neural synchrony is the neural code for perceptual grouping and segmentation [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] , although some studies have failed to confirm this idea 102, [126] [127] [128] [129] . It has been proposed that perceptual grouping is achieved by synchronizing the activity of neurons representing the grouped features 130, 131 , and that neuronal synchrony plays important roles in sensorimotor integration [132] [133] [134] . Synchrony in itself may be more a reflection of the dynamic connectivity leading to task dependent alterations in neural tuning rather than the information being carried by the relative timing of action potentials per se. The two may in fact be related, with alterations in effective connectivity underlying the task-dependent changes in tuning. Selective attention can also provide a solution to the "superposition problem", where contour components belonging to one object have to be associated with one another and perceptually separated from components that belong to the object's background. The role of attention in synchronization is seen in animals performing a color change detection task, in which there is gamma band synchronization between cortical sites encoding the behaviorally relevant stimulus 135 . Also, top-down influences can affect effective connectivity between cortical areas. Just as attention can increase gamma band synchronization within V4, it increases synchronization between the frontal eye fields and V4 136, 137 . This idea is supported in human subjects by fMRI based correlations of BOLD background connectivity between cortical areas, which is specific to task and cortical area 138 . It is important to emphasize that top-down influences don't just alter effective connectivity in general, they can selectively and differentially change the effective connectivity between cortical sites that are task relevant 101 . Signals that represent top-down influences are observed following the cue directing the task or expectation and before the stimulus presentation 99, 101, 139, 140 . The pre-stimulus taskdependent activity suggests that subthreshold signals set the cortical "state" for executing the calculation that is appropriate for the behavioral context, and that a given percept results from the set of states assumed by the entire network of cortical areas. This view contrasts with the traditional idea that perception results from the activity of a small number of cells at the top of the visual hierarchy. Instead, the percept arises from the global set of cortical states and task-specific interactions between multiple cortical areas. The connectivity mediating top-down instructions is likely to include cortico-cortical feedback connections. For area V1, for example, although the strongest feedback arises from area V2, there are a number of cortical areas that provide direct recurrent input to V1, including those in the ventral pathway, such as areas V4 and IT, and areas in the dorsal pathway, including area MT 14, [141] [142] [143] . The feedback projection from area MT to V1 has been implicated in visual awareness 144 . The ventral pathway inputs could provide information about object expectation and the dorsal pathway inputs could provide information about attentional locus or saliency maps. In addition, other areas, such as prefrontal cortex, could provide executive control over a perceptual task, and the sites of transmission from prefrontal cortex to posterior areas depend on the nature of the task 69 . Though prefrontal cortex is not directly connected to V1, it could exert its influence by a cascade of connections descending through the parietal lobe. Other non-cortical sources of recurrent input have been suggested, such as the pulvinar 145, 146 . Multiple sources are likely to be involved in top-down control, but as indicated above, they must be capable of carrying the richness of information involved in not only spatial attention but expectation and perceptual task. (Figure 1 ) Summary The existence of such a varied array of top-down influences and their profound effect on the functional properties of neurons (as well as on their interactions within neuronal ensembles) raises a host of questions for further investigation: What are the sources of the various types of top-down control and what are the pathways by which this control is exerted? What is the nature of the signal that is conveyed along these recurrent pathways? What are the synaptic and network mechanisms by which feedforward, recurrent and intrinsic cortical connections interact to enable adaptive changes in neuronal function? The challenge is to address these questions in the context of the intact, functioning system and to do so in behaving animals. By selecting different sets of inputs neurons take on different functions. The source of topdown influences can be widespread, either by direct connections from different cortical areas, or by a cascade of inputs originating from many more areas. In effect a large part of the cerebral cortex can exert influences over individual neurons within a particular area, with multiple descending inputs interacting with intrinsic cortical connections (Figure 6 ). As such, each neuron is a microcosm of the brain as a whole, with synapses carrying information originating from far flung brain regions. This mode of operation has important implications for our understanding of the cortical mechanisms underlying all sensory modalities and behaviors, and its dysfunction may be the cause of behavioral disorders.

His work focuses on the brain mechanisms of visual perception and learning at the molecular, circuit and perceptual levels. He studies the way in which the brain analyzes visual images, how this analysis is shaped by higher order cognitive influences and by perceptual learning, and the circuit mechanisms of experience dependent plasticity of the adult visual cortex. Glossary Visual cortical hierarchy Refers to the hierarchy of cortical areas in the classical model of the cortical representation of visual information beginning with the primary visual cortex and ascending through two pathways, a ventral pathway extending into the temporal lobe, which is involved with object recognition, and a dorsal pathway extending into the parietal lobe, which is involved with visually directed movement and spatial attention. Reentrant or feedback pathways Refers to the processing strategy whereby the product of an ongoing computation at one cortical level is analyzed by the next level. The resultant information is then sent back to the initial level to influence its further computation. This is also sometimes referred to as countercurrent processing streams. Intermediate level vision Visual processing has been characterized as involving three stages, low level vision, the analysis of simple attributes such as contrast, orientation, movement and color, intermediate level vision, which involves contour integration and surface segmentation, and high level vision, which involves object recognition. Distracters In a complex visual scene, some objects are attended (the targets) and others (the distracters) are unattended, but the distracters can compete with the target for attentional resources. Hemifield Visual cortical areas are topographically mapped, particularly those at earlier stages in the cortical hierarchy. A cortical area in one hemisphere receives input from the contralateral half of the visual field, or hemifield. Line label The property or information represented by a neuron. Different neurons represent different values, and the strength of their firing indicates how close the stimulus is to that value. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex carry out different functions in accordance with task. Top, monkeys were trained to discriminate between "dog" and "cat" categories in a delayed match to sample task as images were morphed from dog to cat prototypes, or between "sports car" and "sedan" categories as imaged were morphed from sports car to sedan prototypes. Bottom, an individual neuron in the prefrontal cortex showed similar responses to images on one side of the category boundary and distinct responses to images on opposite sides of the category boundary. The differential responses during the delay period between dog/cat categories or sports car/sedan categories support the idea of neuronal multitasking. Top-down influences dynamically change effective connectivity within and between cortical areas, allowing neurons to select inputs, and take on functional properties, that are appropriate for the immediate behavioral context. As a result each cortical area and each neuron within that area is an adaptive processor, continuously changing its line label to serve different functions. Right, Long range horizontal connections link distant points in each cortical map, mediating an association field that provides a set of potential interactions. The association field in V1 is represented by the gray cocircular and collinear lines and by the fields of oriented line segments on either side of the central black neuron. The underlying circuit is represented by the long range horizontal connections formed by excitatory neurons (triangles) and disynaptic connections involving inhibitory neurons (circles). Depending on the top-down instruction, different sets of inputs can be gated according to the state of feedback (represented by the green connections coming from higher order cortical areas), so that under different tasks the black neuron may select either the red or blue inputs. Because of the multiple sources of long range inputs coming from within the same cortical area and from many other cortical areas, and because these influences can cascade over multiple nodes, each neuron effectively becomes a microcosm of nearly the entire brain. Left, multiple layers of such interactions operate across the entire visual pathway, each cortical area containing its own gate-able association field, and top-down interactions cascade across the layers (feedforward pathways are represented by the blue connections between cortical "planes" and feedback pathways are represented by the red connections), not just between nearby cortical areas but also by longer range connections that skip over multiple stages (not shown). Each cortical area is represented here as a 2-dimensional network, but because of their laminar structure different layers tend to be responsible for feedforward connections (superficial cortical layers) and feedback connections (deep cortical layers). Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. Feedback pathways carrying top-down informationProcessing visual information involves feed forward connections across a hierarchy of cortical areas (represented by the blue arrows) beginning in primary visual cortex (V1), which in turn receives input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The feed forward connections extend through a ventral pathway into the temporal lobe and a dorsal pathway into the parietal and prefrontal cortex. Matching these feedforward connections are a series of reciprocal feedback connections (represented by the red arrows), providing descending top-down influences that mediate "reentrant" processing. Feedback is seen in direct corticocortical connections (those directed towards V1), in projections from V1 to the LGN, and in interactions between cortical areas mediated by the pulvinar. Information about motor commands, or efference copy, is fed to the sensory apparatus by a pathway involving the superior colliculus (SC), medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) and frontal eye fields (FEF). In addition to direct reciprocal connections, for example from V2 to V1, feedback can cascade over a succession of areas, for example PF to FEF to V4 to V2 to V1. As outlined in this review, a diversity of information is conveyed across these pathways, including attention, expectation, perceptual task and efference copy.

Task-dependent changes in neural tuning and information content in V1 Monkeys were trained to perform two different tasks with a visual stimulus consisting of 5 lines -a central line flanked by two collinear and two parallel lines. Each of the pairs of flanking lines were presented in one of 5 offsets relative to the central line fixed in the receptive field of a recorded neuron, forming a total of 25 stimulus conditions. From these stimuli the animals were cued to perform either a 3-line bisection task, based on the relative positions of the 3 parallel lines, or a vernier discrimination task, based on the relative positions of the 3 collinear lines. The bisection task involves judging to which of the two flanking parallel lines the central line is closer, and the vernier task involves judging the direction of offset of the central line relative to the two collinear lines. (a) The tuning of neurons to the offset of the side-flanks was measured when the animal performed either the 3-line bisection task, where the side flank position was relevant to the task (solid red line), or the vernier discrimination task, where the side flank position was irrelevant to the task (dashed black line). The cell shown in this example was more modulated in its response to side flank offset position when the animal performed the 3-line bisection task (difference in response shown in blue). (b) The change in tuning of a V1 cell to the end-flank offset position when the animal performed the vernier discrimination task, where the tuning was relevant to the task (solid red line) versus when it performed the 3-line bisection task, where the tuning was task irrelevant (dashed black line). (c) The difference in tuning for task relevant and task irrelevant conditions was characterized in terms of mutual information, where the population of recorded neurons carried more information relative to side flank tuning (blue ×) or vernier tuning (red +) in the task relevant condition than in the task irrelevant condition. A series of Monte-Carlo simulations where the responses were randomly assigned to the two different tasks are shown in the blue and red clouds, which are located on the diagonal and far from the experimental conditions. (d) The difference in response between the task relevant and task irrelevant conditions arose from the outset of the Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3. (from Cromer et al, 2010 72 figure 2). Figure 4 . 4 Figure 4. Learned association generates recall-related activity in area MT Area MT normally responds to moving stimuli. However, when trained to associate a moving stimulus, a set of dots moving in a particular direction, with a static stimulus, an arrow (top), neurons become activated by the static stimulus. Bottom A, A neuron in area MT responds to and shows directional tuning to both the moving dot stimulus (red) and the static arrow stimulus (blue). B, for this neuron, polar plot showing tuning to direction of movement (red) and to arrow orientation (blue). (from Schlack and Albright, 2007 85 figure 2). Figure 5 . 5 Figure 5. Task dependent changes in local field potential coherence and noise correlations in area V1. Neurons were recorded with a 96 electrode array in animals trained on the 3-line bisection or vernier discrimination tasks based on the 5 line stimulus (a, b) or on the contour detection task based on a series of collinear line segments embedded in a background of randomly positioned and oriented lines (c). The effective connectivity between cortical sites representing parallel flanks (a) and collinear flanks (b) was measured by calculating the coherence between local field potentials (LFPs) at different frequencies. The graphs in the center column represent LFP-LFP coherence during the response interval from 100 to 500 ms in the task relevant (red) and task irrelevant (black) conditions. Operations involving grouping of parallel sites, 3-line bisection, or of collinear sites, contour detection, give stronger coherence in the task relevant condition. Operations involving segregation of collinear sites, vernier discrimination, produces weaker coherence in the task relevant condition. The difference in coherence in the 3-line bisection and vernier tasks was seen not only during the entire response period but in the interval preceding stimulus presentation, indicating top-down setting of lateral cortical interactions in advance of the appearance of the stimulus. (d), Noise correlations show task dependent differences. Calculated as Fisher information as a function of changes in stimulus bar position for the three task conditions (black, attend-away, green, attention to the receptive field location, red, performing the relevant task at the receptive field location), the V1 network carried more information about the stimulus when the animal performed the task, and roughly equal contributions to the increase in information came from the changes in neuronal tuning (dotted red line) and from the changes in noise correlation (solid red line).

EY007968 31125014 B07008 Noise The variability in neurons' responses to a given stimulus. If different neurons with similar functional properties have independent noise, an ensemble of such neurons can carry more information about a stimulus than a single neuron. Local field potential The electrical field generated by a population of neurons, with signals having components spanning a spectrum of frequencies. Local field potentials originate from the integrated currents coming from synaptic activation and from action potentials in dendrites, cell somata and axons.

Introduction Our ability to selectively focus attention is a core cognitive ability (Posner 1980) . Extensive research on visual selective attention has demonstrated that sensory signals are strongly modulated by attention at various stages of the visual pathways (Van Voorhis and Hillyard 1977; Moran and Desimone 1985; Heinze et al. 1994; Chelazzi et al. 1998; Tootell et al. 1998; O'Connor et al. 2002; Briggs et al. 2013) . Most models of visual attention posit that this modulation of visual processing is under the control of a frontoparietal attention network whose top-down influences alter the gain of signals in multiple visual areas (Mesulam 1999; Corbetta and Shulman 2002; Miller and Buschman 2013) . Evidence for such models comes from observations of attentional deficits following focal brain damage (Mesulam 1981 ; Barcelo et al. 2000) , spatially specific changes in the background neural activity (single neuron spikes, blood-oxygen-level dependent [BOLD] signals, and electroencephalography [EEG] alpha activity) in visual cortex during preparatory attention (Luck et al. 1997; Kastner et al. 1999; Hopfinger et al. 2000; Worden et al. 2000; Thut et al. 2006) , and modulations of visual cortical activity by stimulation in the frontal and parietal cortex (Hilgetag et al. 2001; Moore and Armstrong 2003; Moore and Fallah 2004; Hung et al. 2005; Thut et al. 2005; Szczepanski et al. 2010) . The modulation of posterior alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) following an attentional cue is one robust neural marker signifying selective sensory biasing by covert attention via top-down mechanisms. When covert attention is directed to one side of the visual field, alpha oscillation is more strongly suppressed over the hemisphere contralateral to the attended hemifield (Worden et al. 2000; Sauseng et al. 2005; Thut et al. 2006; Rajagovindan and Ding 2011) . This lateralized reduction of alpha activity is thought to reflect an increase in cortical excitability in task-relevant sensory neurons to facilitate the processing of upcoming stimulus inputs (Sauseng et al. 2005; Thut et al. 2006; Romei et al. 2008) . Putative sources of the top-down control signals include the dorsal frontoparietal attention network, and other higher-order executive regions known to mediate goal-directed behaviors (Kastner et al. 1999; Corbetta et al. 2000; Hopfinger et al. 2000; Capotosto et al. 2009; Corbetta and Shulman 2011) . Two recent studies employing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) showed disrupted alpha lateralization after selectively disrupting processing in the frontal eye field (FEF) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) (Capotosto et al. 2009 (Capotosto et al. , 2012)) , providing strong evidence of the functional link between activity in the frontoparietal network and modulation of posterior alpha activity. Evidence from testing that does not perturb neural activity, however, has remained scarce. The simultaneous recording of EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) opens avenues to address this gap. In the present study, we recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI from subjects performing a cued visual-spatial attention task. Correlating single-trial alpha power and alpha lateralization during the post-cue period with BOLD activity across the entire brain, we sought to identify sources responsible for different aspects of attention-related alpha modulation, and to establish additional evidence for direct interactions between frontoparietal control systems and visual cortical activity during anticipatory attention. We also investigated the involvement of other brain structures known to mediate goal-directed behavior, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) (Crottaz-Herbette and Menon 2006; Dosenbach et al. 2006) . Materials and Methods Participants Eighteen right-handed college students with normal or corrected-tonormal vision, and no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, participated in the study in exchange for course credit. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Florida. Written informed consent was obtained from every participant before the experiment. Data from 5 participants were excluded for one of the following 3 reasons: (1) behavioral performance below criterion (1 participant); (2) difficulties in following task instructions (1 participant); and (3) excessive body or eye movements (3 participants). The remaining 13 participants (5 females) had a mean age of 19 years (SD = 1.34 years). Paradigm Stimuli were displayed on a 30-in. MR-compatible LCD monitor with 60-Hz refresh rate that was placed outside of the scanner bore beyond the head of the subject. Participants viewed the stimuli via a mirror at a viewing distance of ∼230 cm. Within an experimental block, participants were instructed to maintain constant fixation on a white dot positioned at the center of a gray background. Two additional dots were placed at the lower left and lower right peripheral visual fields (5°l ateral to the central fixation and 1.2°below the horizontal meridian) to continuously mark the 2 locations where task-relevant or irrelevant stimuli would appear. As illustrated in Figure 1 , each trial began with a 200 ms duration symbolic cue presented slightly above the central fixation point, which instructed the participants to covertly direct their attention (not their eyes) to either the lower left or lower right visual field. Left-directing cues and right-directing cues had equal probability. Following a variable cue-target interval randomized between 2000 and 8000 ms, target stimuli composed of vertical black-and-white gratings (100% contrast; 1.7°in viewing angle) were flashed briefly for 100 ms at one of the marked peripheral locations with equal probability (50% target validity). When a target stimulus appeared at the cued (attended) spatial location, participants were required to discriminate the spatial frequency (5.5 vs. 5.0 cycles per degree) of the grating and make a speeded 2-button choice response using their right index or middle fingers without sacrificing accuracy. Stimuli occurring at the unattended location were to be ignored. The difficulty in discriminating the 2 grating patterns, which had very similar spatial frequencies, strongly encouraged the deployment and maintenance of covert attention following the cue. It should be noted that the instructional cueing strategy used here differs slightly from the probabilistic cueing method used in classical visuospatial attention paradigms (e.g., Posner 1980) because it does not require responses for stimuli at uncued locations, and therefore does not yield behavioral measures of selective attention. We have employed this instructional cue approach previously (e.g., Hopf and Mangun 2000; Hopfinger et al. 2000; Walsh et al. 2011) , as have other investigators (e.g., Worden et al. 2000; Kelly et al. 2009) , because it engenders strongly focused attention. In a control behavioral study in the scanner, however, we tested our design using probabilistic cueing with the same stimuli and presentation schedule and obtained behavioral measures of target processing at both the cued-and uncued-location. In addition, we incorporated a divided attention decrement test where the cue instructed the subjects to divide attention between left and right field locations (Navon and Gopher 1979) . We observed the standard attention effects in reaction time (RT): responses to cued targets were significantly faster than those in the divided attention condition (P < 0.01) or the uncued condition (P < 0.03). Therefore, the speeded discrimination task was sufficiently difficult to require focal attention to achieve maximal performance. In addition to the 2 types of instructional cues (attend-left versus attend-right), there was a third type of cue (choice cue) randomly inserted in the trial sequence of the experiment, but this condition was not analyzed with respect to the main question of interest in the present study. Nonetheless, we provide the details so all aspects of the design are reported. Upon seeing the choice cue, participants were asked to spontaneously decide which spatial location to attend and then covertly attended the chosen location. The target discrimination task performed in the choice trials was the same as that in the instructional trials. As noted above, these trials were not analyzed for the present study (see Bengson et al. 2014 for additional details of the full design). Regardless of cue type (cued or choice), following the target stimulus by a random interval of 2000-8000 ms, participants were further prompted by the screen "?SIDE?" to report the spatial location they attended within the trial via a button press (index finger: left, middle finger: right). After reporting where they had attended for that trial, an intertrial interval (ITI) randomized between 2000 and 8000 ms elapsed before the start of the next trial. Bilaterally symmetric symbols were used as cues (T, O, and ◊), and were counterbalanced across subjects as to their meaning (attend-left, attend-right, or freely choose). All participants went through a training session before the actual experiment to ensure adequate performance (above 70% accuracy) and proper maintenance of eye fixation. The experimental session was divided into multiple blocks of trials, with the length of each block kept around 6 min to prevent subject fatigue. Each participant completed between 8 and 12 blocks for the experiment. A short break was administered between 2 adjacent blocks. The meaning of cues and the importance of proper maintenance of eye fixation were emphasized during each break. EEG Acquisition and Preprocessing Continuous EEG data were collected during the experiment with a 32-channel MR-compatible EEG recording system (Brain Products, Germany). Thirty-one Ag/AgCl electrodes were placed on the scalp according to the 10-20 system using an elastic cap. One additional electrode was placed on the subject's upper back to record the electrocardiogram (ECG), which was subsequently used to remove the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact during EEG preprocessing. The impedance from scalp channels was kept <5 kΩ throughout the experiment. Referenced to site FCz during recording, the EEG data were bandpass filtered between 0.1 and 250 Hz, sampled at 5000 samples per second, and synchronized with the scanner's internal clock, a step important for the proper removal of the gradient artifacts in subsequent data processing. The initial EEG preprocessing was performed in BrainVision Analyzer 2.0 (Brain Products, Germany). Gradient and the BCG artifacts were corrected according to a modified version of the average artifact subtraction method proposed in Allen et al. (1998 Allen et al. ( , 2000)) . Specifically, the gradient artifacts were corrected by constructing an average artifact template over 41 consecutive volumes in a sliding-window fashion, and then subtracting this template from the raw EEG data for each volume. The BCG artifacts were removed using a similar approach in which ECG R-waves were first detected, and 21 consecutive ECG segments defined around the R-waves were averaged to produce a BCG artifact template. The resulting artifact template was then subtracted from EEG data to correct for BCG contamination. The MR-corrected EEG data were then bandpass filtered from 0.1 to 50 Hz, and down Figure 1 . An illustration of the sequence of events within a trial. Following cue onset, participants covertly directed their attention toward either left or right hemifield marked by the 2 white dots, while maintaining eye fixation on the central dot. Targets were flashed briefly at one of the marked locations after a variable inter-stimulus interval. Participants were required to discriminate the spatial frequency of the gratings and make a forced 2-button choice response only when targets appeared on the attended location. At the end of each trial, participants were also prompted to report the hemifield they attended to. This reporting was necessitated by another condition of the experiment where the participants, upon seeing a "choice cue," spontaneously decided which side to attend. Data from this choice condition was not analyzed here. sampled to 250 Hz before being exported to EEGLAB (Delorme and Makeig 2004 ) for further analyses. The continuous EEG data were epoched from 500 ms before to 1500 ms after cue onset separately for the attend-left and attend-right trials. Only trials with correct responses were included. Epochs were visually inspected for artifact contamination and trials containing excessive body movement-related artifacts were rejected. Frontal channels (channels FP1, FP2, F7, and F8) were further used to monitor subjects' eye movements and blinks. Epochs contaminated by eye movements as indicated by electro-oculograms recorded from anterior and lateral frontal channels were rejected. We further removed epochs during which subjects blinked within a 200 ms window around cue onset. Across subjects, the mean trial rejection rate was 9.5%, and the mean number of artifact-free trials was 67 and 66 for attend-left and attend-right conditions, respectively. Further EEG preprocessing using Second-Order Blind Identification (Belouchrani et al. 1993 ) was applied to correct for any residual BCG, eye-blinking, and movement-related artifacts. To sharpen spatial localization, the artifact-free scalp voltage data were converted into reference-free current source density (CSD) data by calculating the 2D spatial Laplacian (Mitzdorf 1985; Chen et al. 2011) . FMRI Acquisition and Preprocessing MR images were acquired using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner (Philips Medical Systems, the Netherlands) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. Functional images were collected during the experimental sessions using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following scanning parameters: repetition time (TR), 1.98 s; echo time, 30 ms; flip angle, 80°; field of view, 224 mm; slice number, 36; voxel size, 3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 mm; matrix size, 64 × 64. The slices were oriented parallel to the plane connecting the anterior and posterior commissures. Image acquisition was performed during the initial 1.85 s within each EPI volume, leaving an interval of 130 ms towards the end of each TR where no image acquisition was performed; the absence of gradient artifacts in this interval enables online visual monitoring of the simultaneous EEG acquisition. MRI data were processed in SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm/, last accessed August 30, 2014). Preprocessing steps included slice timing correction, realignment, spatial coregistration, normalization, and smoothing. Specifically, slice timing correction was carried out using sinc interpolation to correct for differences in slice acquisition time within an EPI volume. The images were then spatially realigned to the first image of each session by a 6-parameter rigid body spatial transformation to account for head movement during acquisition. Each subject's images were then normalized and registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. All images were further resampled to a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm, and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 8 mm full width at half maximum. Slow temporal drifts in baseline were removed by applying a high-pass filter with cutoff frequency set at 1/128 Hz. Global effects were accounted for by using the proportional scaling approach which divides the signal from each voxel by the spatial average of signals from all cerebral voxels (Fox et al. 2009) . EEG Spectral Analysis EEG power spectral density (PSD) was calculated on the CSD data in the period from 500 to 1000 ms after cue onset (Fig. 2A ) using the FFT-based periodogram approach. To calculate the grand average power spectrum across subjects, the power spectrum from each subject was normalized by dividing the PSD by that subject's mean alpha power from the attend-left condition. Such normalization was not performed when correlating alpha power with the BOLD signal. For each subject, trial-by-trial spectral power in the alpha band was calculated by integrating the unnormalized single-trial power spectrum within the range of 8-12 Hz in regions of interests (ROIs) over occipitoparietal sites where alpha showed the strongest attentional effects (Fig. 2B, C ; left hemisphere: O1 and P3; right hemisphere: O2 and P8). The selected posterior scalp ROIs for EEG alpha analysis corresponded well to the scalp regions used in previous studies (e.g., Worden et al. 2000; Thut et al. 2006) . For trials rejected during preprocessing because of EEG artifacts, we used the mean alpha power calculated within the same condition as substitutes, to allow for regression with trial-by-trial BOLD activity in subsequent EEG-informed fMRI analysis. To measure alpha asymmetry, a single-trial alpha hemispheric lateralization index was defined as (Thut et al. 2006 ): Index ðaÞ ¼ a ipsilateral ROI À a contralateral ROI meanða ROIs from both condition Þ : The above lateralization index measures the percentage difference between single-trial alpha amplitudes from ROIs ipsilateral and contralateral to the attended visual field. Larger values of the above index indicate stronger lateralization of alpha due to attention. FMRI Activation Analysis The BOLD responses were examined using general linear models (GLMs) as implemented in SPM5. In total, 8 task-related regressors were included in the GLM to model the following stimulus events: 2 regressors separately modeled BOLD activity related to leftward and rightward cues with correct responses; 2 additional regressors modeled BOLD responses evoked by target stimuli appearing on the left and right visual fields; a fifth regressor of no interest was added to model cue events with incorrect responses; finally, the choice cues as well as the side-reporting were also included in the GLM as regressors of no interest to account for BOLD activity evoked by these events. Group-level cue-evoked fMRI activations were obtained by a parametric one-sample t-test and were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Event-related BOLD responses to target stimuli in the visual cortex were estimated via a GLM with finite impulse response (FIR) model as implemented in MarsBaR region of interest toolbox (http://marsbar. sourceforge.net/, last accessed August 30, 2014). Activations in visual cortex by targets were identified by examining the positive BOLD activations by target stimuli under P < 0.05, FDR (Fig. 2E ). A 3-mm-radius spherical ROI was then seeded around the peak voxel in the left and right calcarine sulci to estimate evoked BOLD activities via the above FIR model. Attentional enhancement related to target processing in the above calcarine ROIs were assessed via a 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on the peak BOLD responses with Target Cueing (cued vs. uncued), Target Hemifield (left vs. right), and Hemisphere (left ROI vs. right ROI) as factors. EEG-informed fMRI Analysis In addition to the above task-related regressors, coupling effects between alpha oscillations and BOLD were modeled in the GLM using parametric modulations based on single-trial alpha power. Specifically, 3 separate GLMs were constructed to model 3 aspects of coupling between BOLD and EEG alpha rhythm: (1) coupling between BOLD and alpha power measured in ROIs contralateral to the attended hemifield, (2) between BOLD and alpha power measured in ROIs ipsilateral to the attended hemifield, and (3) between BOLD and attentioninduced alpha lateralization. For the first 2 GLMs (Models 1 and 2), 2 regressors modeling attentional modulation of alpha power were included in the design matrix with onsets of the boxcar functions specified according to cue onset timings in attend-left and attend-right conditions. The height of each boxcar function modeling each trial within these regressors was multiplied by the single-trial alpha power sampled from the contralateral ROI in Model 1 and from the ipsilateral ROI in Model 2. To orthogonalize the parametric modulation with respect to regressors modeling cue-related activities, the mean alpha power across trials within a session was subtracted from single-trial alpha powers for the corresponding cue conditions. The resultant regression coefficients indicate the strength of coupling between BOLD and alpha power measured separately on the contralateral and ipsilateral ROIs. In the third model (Model 3), the interaction between BOLD and the degree of alpha hemispheric lateralization was modeled by a set of parametric modulations derived from the single-trial alpha lateralization index. Specifically, in Model 3, 2 new regressors were included in the GLM in the same way as in Models 1 and 2 for the attend-left and attend-right conditions, but with the height of the boxcar functions modeling each cue onset multiplied by the mean-removed single-trial alpha lateralization index. All task-relevant regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function to allow for comparisons with the recorded BOLD signal. Six movement-related regressors were further incorporated into the design matrix to regress out residual signal variance from head movement. At the individual subject level, the coupling between BOLD and alpha modulation was assessed by examining, via t-contrasts, the significance of the coefficients related to the alpha regressors. At the group level, systematic alpha-BOLD coupling was further assessed via a second-level random effects analysis using the contrast images from individual-level alpha-BOLD coupling analysis via a nonparametric permutation testing scheme as implemented in SnPM (Statistical Nonparametric Mapping, http://go.warwick.ac.uk/tenichols/snpm, last accessed August 30, 2014). Compared with the parametric tests, nonparametric permutation tests require much weaker assumptions about properties of data samples (Nichols and Holmes 2001 ) and hence, are more suitable for EEG data recorded concurrently with fMRI where multiple sources of noise/uncertainty in the EEG-related regressors might render the normality assumption untenable. The test first shuffles the condition labels of each sample in the group and computes the test statistic for each relabeling to construct an empirical distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. Then, the actual observed test statistic was compared against the critical value derived from the empirical distribution to assess statistical significance. EEG-BOLD couplings are typically weak because they measure the residual effects after the mean evoked BOLD responses are removed. Past work using voxel-wise thresholds of P < 0.001 or P < 0.005, uncorrected, has yielded highly interpretable statistical brain maps (Laufs et al. 2003; Debener et al. 2005; Eichele et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2012 ). Here, additional requirements that the coupling should be consistently observed across all individual subjects and the activated cluster contains at least 5 voxels were adopted. To further test the statistical robustness of activated regions, we utilized the maximal statistic approach as discussed in Nichols and Holmes (2001) to correct for multiple comparisons and limit family-wise Type I errors. Specifically, the family-wise Type I error was controlled by thresholding the observed statistical map using a cluster-level critical value derived from the permutation distribution of the maximal suprathreshold cluster size from every possible relabeling (Holmes et al. 1996) . The primary threshold used in this study to generate suprathreshold clusters was P < 0.005, uncorrected. Alpha-BOLD coupling effects exceeding the 95th percentile of the above permutation distribution of the maximal suprathreshold cluster size were denoted P FWE < 0.05 under this correction scheme. It has been suggested that this type of cluster-level threshold is more suitable for multiple comparison correction in fMRI data than typical single-voxel based approaches such as the FDR implemented in SPM (Nichols and Holmes 2001) . Results For the 13 subjects included in the analysis, the mean accuracy rates for discriminating the spatial frequency of the grating stimuli were 85.4% for attend-left and 86.0% for attend-right conditions, respectively. No difference was observed in reaction time between attend-left (mean = 927.94 ms; SD = 101.16 ms) and attend-right (mean = 911.38 ms; SD = 82.92 ms) conditions ( paired t-test, P = 0.38). Attention-related Modulation of Occipital Alpha The average alpha peak frequency was 10.2 Hz with a standard deviation of 0.94 Hz among the 13 subjects. For the chosen postcue/pretarget analysis window (500-1000 ms postcue), posterior alpha over both hemispheres was lower than a precue baseline defined to be 500 ms before cue onset (Fig. 2B ), with a stronger decrease in alpha power over the occipital scalp region contralateral to the attended hemifield (Fig. 2A ; left hemisphere: t 12 = -2.1462, P < 0.05; right hemisphere: t 12 = -1.9145, P < 0.05). Topographically, the difference in the degree of alpha suppression between 2 hemispheres gave rise to the hemispheric lateralization pattern seen in Figure 2C , in which alpha power from the attend-right condition was subtracted from the attend-left condition. This lateralization pattern in posterior alpha matches findings reported in prior studies of visual spatial attention (e.g., Worden et al. 2000; Thut et al. 2006) . Attentional Control: BOLD Activations Evoked by the cue Significant BOLD activations in areas within the dorsal attention network were observed in the postcue interval, including bilateral FEF, IPS, and regions within the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 2D ). This activation pattern is in line with those typically observed in the attention literature (e.g., Corbetta and Shulman 2011) , and in conjunction with the postcue lateralization of alpha, indicates that participants properly allocated their covert attention during the cue-to-target interval according to cue instructions. Other regions activated during the anticipatory period included the supplementary motor area (SMA), precuneus, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and middle temporal complex (MT+). The coordinates of all the activated regions are listed in Table 1 . Attentional Selection of Sensory Signals: BOLD Activations Evoked by the Target Target stimuli evoked significant BOLD activations in the visual cortex within the calcarine sulcus and adjacent lingual gyrus (Fig. 2E , outlined in yellow; MNI coordinates for left calcarine: -11, -83, 8; right calcarine: 15, -71, 9). To assess whether spatial attention enhances target processing in the visual cortex, event-related BOLD responses in ROIs within the calcarine cortex were extracted for attended and unattended targets in the left and right hemifield (Fig. 2F ). Enhanced BOLD activity was observed in calcarine ROIs contralateral to the attended target location. We conducted a 3-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA with Target Cueing (cued vs. uncued), Target Hemifield (left vs. right), and Hemisphere (left ROI vs. right ROI) as within-subject factors and identified a significant main effect of Target Cueing (F 1,12 = 6.171, P < 0.05), and a significant 3-way interaction among Target Cueing, Target Hemifield, and Hemisphere (F 1,12 = 6.366, P < 0.05). Follow-up analyses via paired t-tests on peak BOLD responses confirmed that for left visual field targets, significant attentional enhancement toward target stimuli (cued > uncued) was observed only in the right visual cortex (RH: P < 0.05, corrected; LH: n.s.), while for right visual field targets, attentional enhancement was only observed in the left visual cortex (LH: P < 0.01, corrected; RH: n.s.). The increased amplitude of BOLD response for attended targets in the visual cortex is consistent with prior fMRI studies of spatial attention (e.g., Hopfinger et al. 2000) , and provides additional evidence that the subjects oriented spatial attention according to the cues. BOLD-alpha Coupling: Inverse Correlations Combining attend-left and attend-right conditions, the alpha contralateral to the cued hemifield was inversely correlated with BOLD in bilateral IPS, left middle frontal gyrus, left ventral occipital cortex (VO), right inferior and middle temporal gyrus (IT/MTG), and left cerebellum (crus I and II), at P < 0.001, uncorrected (Fig. 3A , first row). That is, on a trial-by-trial basis, when these brain regions were more active, alpha was more reduced over the occipital scalp contralateral to the cued hemifield. Among the above regions, bilateral IPS and the left cerebellum showed stronger inverse coupling with contralateral alpha at P FWE < 0.05 (cluster-level threshold; left IPS: 222 voxels; right IPS: 262 voxels; left cerebellum: 55 voxels). Under a voxel-level statistical threshold of P < 0.005, uncorrected, BOLD signals from extended regions in the calcarine sulcus (CaS), bilateral VO, and bilateral crus II regions of the cerebellum further showed inverse correlations with alpha power in the hemisphere contralateral to the cued hemifield (Fig. 3A , second row). For alpha ipsilateral to the cued hemifield, regions showing inverse BOLD-alpha correlations at P < 0.001, uncorrected, included bilateral IPS and crus II of the left cerebellum (Fig. 3B ; Table 2 ). These correlations were generally weaker as no region showed a coupling strength that reached P FWE < 0.05. The coordinates of the regions showing inverse alpha-BOLD coupling are listed in Table 2 . A ROI-based analysis within the IPS revealed that the mean number of voxels showing significant inverse BOLD-alpha coupling in the left and right IPS clusters were 184 and 55, respectively, for ipsilateral alpha, while for contralateral alpha the respective cluster sizes were 222 and 262; the contralateral alpha-BOLD coupling cluster sizes were significantly larger than for the ipsilateral alpha-BOLD coupling (P < 0.001, onesided, paired t-test; test performed on 500 bootstrap samples constructed by the subjects with replacement; Fig. 4A ). In addition to differences in cluster size, the inverse coupling strength between alpha and the left IPS, measured by the coefficient in front of the regressor representing contralateral or ipsilateral alpha collapsed across attend-right and attend-left conditions, was stronger (more negative) for contralateral alpha than ipsilateral alpha (coupling strength for contralateral alpha: -1.26; ipsilateral alpha: -0.96; P < 0.05, one-sided, paired t-test; Fig. 4B ). Yet, in right IPS, the inverse coupling was only marginally stronger for contralateral alpha compared with ipsilateral alpha (coupling strength for contralateral alpha: -1.04; ipsilateral alpha: -0.96; n.s.; Fig. 4B ). These results suggest that the coupling between IPS and the ipsilateral alpha is generally weaker than that for contralateral alpha. It is worth noting that no coupling ( positive or inverse) was observed between alpha and BOLD signals in the FEF. BOLD-alpha Coupling: Positive Correlations For alpha recorded from the occipital scalp contralateral to the cued hemifield, areas showing positive BOLD-alpha correlation included regions within the precentral gyrus ( pre-CG), postcentral gyrus ( post-CG), and middle temporal gyrus (MTG), at P < 0.001, uncorrected (Fig. 5A ). That is, on a trial-by-trial basis, these brain regions showed decreased BOLD activity when alpha power also decreased. Among these regions, the positive coupling between bilateral post-CG and contralateral alpha is stronger, reaching P FWE < 0.05 (cluster-level threshold; left post-CG: 64 voxels; right post-CG: 47 voxels). For ipsilateral alpha, BOLD in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and adjacent cortices in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) showed positive correlation at P < 0.001, uncorrected (Fig. 5B ). No region showed significant positive coupling with ipsilateral alpha under P FWE < 0.05. While pre-and post-CG are in the sensorimotor cortices, the MPFC and MTG are core nodes of the default mode network (DMN). Table 2 lists the coordinates of regions that show positive correlations with alpha. Coupling Between Alpha Lateralization Index and BOLD The analysis in the foregoing 2 sections focused on the alpha power recorded over either the occipital hemispheres contralateral or ipsilateral to the cued hemifield. The degree of alpha lateralization, defined as ipsilateral alpha minus contralateral alpha normalized by their sum, assesses the alpha difference between the 2 hemispheres and is an important indicator of attentional control, with greater alpha lateralization signifying a more efficient allocation of spatial attention (Thut et al. 2006; Haegens et al. 2011; Händel et al. 2011) . Correlating the trialby-trial alpha lateralization index with BOLD activity, we found positive correlation between the alpha lateralization index and BOLD activity in regions within the dACC, as well as adjacent areas of right MPFC and left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (superior frontal gyrus, SFG, Brodmann area 9) (Fig. 6A, B ; Table 2 ). That is, on a trial-by-trial basis, when alpha was more strongly lateralized, BOLD signals in these regions were of greater amplitude. ROI-based analysis within the dACC showed that the strength of positive coupling, measured by the coefficient in front of the regressor representing alpha lateralization collapsed across attend-right and attendleft conditions, was highly consistent across participants ( positive coupling observed in 12 out of 13 participants with the only exception of Subject 9; Fig. 6C, D ), suggesting that the observed effect was not likely to be caused by outliers. These regions, especially dACC, have been hypothesized to be part of a "core" or "task control" or "salience" network responsible for maintaining executive control over the ongoing task (Dosenbach et al. 2008) . No regions were found to be inversely correlated with the alpha lateralization index. Regions included were thresholded by default at P < 0.001, uncorrected, if not stated otherwise. *P FWE < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-level nonparametric permutation test. Cluster sizes under the primary threshold of P < 0.005, uncorrected, are reported in parentheses. Note the crus I and crus II of the left cerebellum form one connected cluster and the combined cluster size is reported. **P < 0.005, uncorrected. Discussion Top-down, anticipatory control of spatial attention enhances the processing of attended stimuli by biasing sensory cortex before stimulus onset. The lateralization of alpha oscillations is a manifestation of this biasing action in visual (Worden et al. 2000; Sauseng et al. 2005; Thut et al. 2006 ) and somatosensory domains (Anderson and Ding 2011; Haegens et al. 2011) . The present work examined brain structures that contribute to the modulation of visual alpha oscillations during anticipatory attention by recording simultaneous EEG-fMRI from human subjects performing a cued visual spatial attention task. Unlike prior resting-state fMRI studies reporting BOLD correlates of alpha oscillations in the frontoparietal network (Laufs et al. 2003) , the current study directly addresses the mechanism of top-down attentional modulation by examining functional links between BOLD and alpha under an active state of covert spatial attention. Correlating hemispheric alpha power and crosshemisphere alpha lateralization with concurrently recorded BOLD signals, we found that: (1) alpha decreases contralateral to the cued hemifield were associated with BOLD increases in IPS, as well as in visual areas; (2) decreases in alpha contralateral to the cued hemifield were also associated with BOLD decreases in the sensorimotor cortices and the default mode network; and (3) the degree of alpha lateralization was positively coupled with BOLD in dACC/MPFC and regions of DLPFC. Alpha and Dorsal Attention Network One putative source of attentional modulation of alpha is the dorsal attention network, which is hypothesized to generate and maintain a top-down expectation signal to selectively bias visual cortical activity (Gitelman et al. 1999; Hopfinger et al. 2000; Corbetta and Shulman 2002) . Here, we provide evidence that increased BOLD in bilateral IPS is most strongly coupled with desynchronized EEG alpha in the hemisphere contralateral to the direction of spatial attention during anticipatory attention. Our results are consistent with 2 recent studies employing rTMS showing disrupted posterior alpha desynchronization following interference of preparatory activities in the IPS (Capotosto et al. 2009 (Capotosto et al. , 2012)) . Whether successful attention allocation is primarily achieved by an enhancement of task-relevant visual cortices, a suppression of task-irrelevant areas, or a combination of the 2 processes, is still debated. Evidence in terms of anticipatory alpha is also mixed. Some studies attribute selective attention to a mechanism of decreased alpha contralateral to the attended location (Sauseng et al. 2005; Thut et al. 2006; Grent-'t-Jong et al. 2011) , whereas other studies suggest that visuospatial attention functions by inhibiting the hemisphere contralateral to the unattended hemifield (Foxe et al. 1998; Worden et al. 2000; Yamagishi et al. 2003; Kelly et al. 2006; Händel et al. 2011 ). It should be noted that only a few studies were able to observe a net increase in alpha power relative to baseline over the hemisphere contralateral to the unattended location (Yamagishi et al. 2003; Kelly et al. 2006 ). In the current study, we observed alpha decreases in both hemispheres with respect to the baseline, with stronger a decrease in the hemisphere contralateral to the attended location (Rajagovindan and Ding 2011) . The stronger inverse coupling between contralateral alpha and BOLD in IPS, compared with ipsilateral alpha, appears to suggest that the IPS operates mainly by enhancing neuronal activity within task-relevant visual cortical areas (Corbetta and Shulman 2002) . Alpha increases over areas ipsilateral to the attended locations are often observed in tasks demanding active suppression of distractors at unattended locations (Yamagishi et al. 2003; Kelly et al. 2006) . This is not a strong requirement in our task and likely resulted in our findings being clearest for the contralateral alpha. Alpha and Task-irrelevant Networks Posterior alpha in the current study was found to be positively correlated with BOLD in sensorimotor cortices, as well as regions within the default mode network (DMN). This indicates that elevated visual cortical excitability, as indicated by decreased posterior alpha, is accompanied by decreased activity within task-irrelevant cortices in other sensory or cognitive modalities. Such a "push-pull" mechanism has been observed in past studies involving attention to multiple sensory modalities (Klimesch et al. 2007; Jensen and Mazaheri 2010) . For example, visual alpha is found to be increased when attention is directed to the somatosensory (Haegens et al. 2010; Anderson and Ding 2011) or the auditory domains (Foxe et al. 1998; Fu et al. 2001) . Similarly, higher levels of alpha activity within visual cortices were associated with enhanced performance toward auditory stimuli (Bollimunta et al. 2008) . The current study extends this mechanism to include the DMN, which is known to mediate non-sensory self-referential processes (Buckner et al. 2008 ). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that even under resting-state, when external task performance is minimal, positive coupling between spontaneous visual alpha fluctuations and BOLD in the DMN occurs, demonstrating an intrinsic dynamic interaction between different cortical systems (Mayhew et al. 2013; Mo et al. 2013) . In light of this, visual attention might modulate such intrinsic functional interactions to selectively inhibit task-irrelevant networks to facilitate processing in the ongoing visual task. It is worth noting that the ipsilateral alpha was only coupled with nodes in DMN, whereas the contralateral alpha showed coupling with both DMN and the sensorimotor network. The additional coupling within the sensorimotor network for contralateral alpha further suggests that the "push-pull" mechanism is more active over the hemisphere contralateral to the attended location. Differential Roles of IPS and FEF in Controlling Alpha A somewhat surprising finding was that alpha power was not coupled with BOLD in FEF, suggesting differential roles of FEF and IPS in modulating visual alpha during anticipatory spatial attention. This finding is consistent with a recent dynamic causal modeling study showing direct modulation of the visual cortex by IPS instead of FEF (Vossel et al. 2012) . Further, rTMS on IPS, but not FEF, has been shown to induce a paradoxical increase in alpha during anticipatory attention (Capotosto et al. 2009) . Taken together, the coupling between IPS and visual alpha found in our study suggests that IPS, instead of FEF, directly modulates the visual cortical excitability reflected in alpha power. Although a host of studies have reported involvement of FEF in modulating visual cortex during attention (Ruff et al. 2006 (Ruff et al. , 2008;; Bressler et al. 2008; Capotosto et al. 2009; Armstrong et al. 2012) , it is possible that such involvement reflects an indirect engagement of FEF in modulating visual cortices, through changes in inter-regional EEG synchrony rather than regional alpha desynchronization (Sauseng et al. 2005 (Sauseng et al. , 2011)) . The Role of Frontal Executive Areas in Controlling Alpha Lateralization Past studies have proposed that the allocation of attentional resources during spatial attention is reflected in the degree of lateralization of alpha across 2 hemispheres (Thut et al. 2006; Händel et al. 2011) . In line with this, it has been shown that stronger alpha lateralization is associated with shorter reaction times (Thut et al. 2006; Kelly et al. 2009; Haegens et al. 2011) . Our findings that the degree of alpha lateralization is positively coupled with BOLD activity in dACC and adjacent prefrontal areas, including the right MPFC and the left DLPFC, are consistent with the known function of these frontal executive areas. Activated in a variety of cognitive tasks, dACC is considered part of a task control or salience network engaged in maintaining a global task-set to mediate goal-directed behavior (Dosenbach et al. 2006 (Dosenbach et al. , 2008;; Sakai 2008) . This network, containing dACC and bilateral anterior insula, is hypothesized to issue top-down signals to other domain-specific executive areas to ensure the proper allocation of resources to support various task-specific activities (Shulman et al. 2003; Crottaz-Herbette and Menon 2006; Dosenbach et al. 2006; Aarts et al. 2008; Walsh et al. 2011; Wen et al. 2013) . Similarly, DLPFC, reciprocally connected with dACC (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic 1988) , is known to be critical in the maintenance of task rules and implementation of cognitive control (MacDonald et al. 2000; Dosenbach et al. 2008) . By demonstrating that both structures are involved in the regulation of sensory cortical activity as indexed by attention-related alpha lateralization, the current study sheds lights on the roles of these frontal executive areas in visual spatial attention, which to date has remained unclear. It should be noted that the positive coupling between dACC/DLPFC and alpha lateralization is relatively weak, and did not reach the threshold of P FWE < 0.05 based on the wholebrain correction for multiple comparisons. This weak coupling strength might be caused by the low signal-to-noise ratio in the single-trial alpha lateralization index, or it could suggest an overall weak coupling between these frontal executive structures and alpha lateralization, which may implicate an indirect role of dACC/DLPFC in modulating alpha. Future studies are needed to clarify this issue. Interestingly, no significant coupling was observed between alpha lateralization and BOLD in IPS in the current study. One possible reason is that the lateralization index was calculated as the difference in alpha power between the contra-and ipsilateral hemispheres. Given that IPS was inversely coupled with both contra-and ipsilateral alpha, the correlation between alpha power differences and BOLD in IPS is likely to be small. Upper Alpha Versus Lower Alpha It has been suggested that scalp-recorded alpha might be further divided into lower and upper alpha sub-bands and each sub-band is engaged in different cognitive and physiological processes (Klimesch 1999) . To test whether our findings would be different for different alpha sub-bands, we also performed all our analyses using the following alpha subbands based on individual alpha frequencies (IAF): lower alpha (IAF-2 Hz to IAF) and upper alpha (IAF to IAF + 2 Hz). The results obtained by using different alpha sub-bands were found to be highly similar to those from the overall alpha band. Limitations The current study has the following limitations. First, although we observed strong postcue alpha lateralization among our participants, we found only a weak and not statistically significant negative association between alpha lateralization and reaction times in our study (i.e., stronger lateralization predicting faster response). The long cue-target intervals in our design, which are often used in fMRI studies of spatial attention to accommodate the sluggish BOLD response, might adversely impact the association between postcue alpha lateralization and behavior; prior work has shown that postcue alpha effects become weaker as the observation window is further moved away from cue onset (Zanto et al. 2011) . Second, although the instructional cueing design is frequently used in spatial attention studies utilizing alpha as the dependent variable, it lacks a behavioral measure of attentional enhancement to ascertain whether participants sustained their attention throughout the relatively long cue-target period. This concern is mitigated by the observation of postcue alpha lateralization and increased BOLD responses to attended targets, indicating that subjects oriented attention according to the instructional cues and maintained a strong attention set during the cue-to-target interval. Finally, the coupling between EEG alpha and BOLD reported in this study are correlational in nature, and thus should be interpreted with caution. Our contention that the regions showing correlation with alpha are likely the regions exerting top-down modulation of alpha should be understood in conjunction with the current models of selective attention. Conclusion The current study contributes to our understanding of the top-down mechanisms of attention by providing evidence demonstrating the involvement of frontoparietal attentional control regions and executive control regions in the selective biasing of sensory activity indexed by alpha oscillations during anticipatory attention. Our findings help to distinguish the differential roles of parietal and frontal regions within the frontoparietal attention network in modulating posterior alpha. By identifying regions whose BOLD responses were either inversely or positively coupled with alpha contralateral or ipsilateral to an attended spatial location, this study further provides evidence that visual attention mechanisms selectively enhance task-relevant visual cortex, while at the same time actively inhibit task-unrelated sensory and cognitive modalities. Further, a role of dACC and DLPFC in anticipatory attentional control is described, which is distinct from the influence of IPS in attentional control during anticipatory attention. Finally, the simultaneous EEG-fMRI technology has emerged as a powerful tool to examine the functional and anatomical substrates of time-resolved neural markers, including various components of event-related potentials and neural oscillatory activity (Laufs et al. 2003; Debener et al. 2005; Eichele et al. 2005; Scheeringa et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012) . As the current study demonstrates, it can provide both novel and corroborative evidence to complement other imaging and physiological methods. Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2.

M ammals use various sensory tools to build a representation of the outside world. A precise and robust representation being critical for survival and reproduction, we evolved a considerable number of different receptors able to respond to external stimuli. This is particularly true for chemical recognition, for which most of us benefit from large odorant chemoreceptor gene repertoires, that range in the hundreds in humans and dogs, up to over a thousand in mice and elephants [1] [2] [3] . Our understanding of olfactory information coding is based on the expression of a single chemoreceptor gene, stochastically chosen from a single allele, in each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN); this is referred to as singular expression [4] [5] [6] [7] . Given the millions of OSNs present in a nasal cavity, large neuronal populations with identical agonist receptivity coexist with other populations that exhibit different response profiles. Olfactory receptors being able to bind various molecules and a volatile to be recognized by different receptors, to any given olfactory stimulus corresponds a specific pattern of activation. The term combinatorial coding has been coined to describe this encoding of chemical identities 8, 9 . The odorant-dependent activation map is not just a concept, but is directly observable in the olfactory bulb, where axonal projections of OSNs coalesce into neuropil-rich structures, the glomeruli, that are each innervated by a specific sensory population. Following this first relay of olfactory processing and after being transmitted to cortical areas, olfactory information often translates into a percept, a smell. A series of parallel and invariable coding lines, defined by the expressed odorant receptor (OR) (and a few guidance molecules that may be differentially expressed between populations), is thus at the heart of the way we understand olfaction. The ability of neurons to adapt, to respond dynamically to the environment, both during development and later, is critical 10 . In the central nervous system, adaptive and compensatory mechanisms that control neural activity, for example through the modulation of synaptic efficacy and membrane excitability, allow homeostasis maintenance within the system upon perturbations 11 . Various mechanisms answering this need have been selected during evolution, among which the repression or activation of specific genes 10, 12, 13 . In a peripheral sensory tool such as the olfactory system, which is in direct contact with highly variable environments, rapid and long-term sensory adaptation and compensatory mechanisms may be of particular importance. Activity-regulated transcription in the olfactory system has been addressed in the past by various groups in the context of axon guidance mechanisms, OSN survival and adaptation to the environment [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Almost without exception, these approaches have involved the silencing of neuronal activity via naris occlusion or activity mutants, thus adding various confounding factors to odorant-induced activity. Due to a lack of technology available at the time, most of these approaches explored the system at the level of the whole olfactory mucosa, precluding an evaluation of the response to a specific ligand of specific neurons or specific neuronal populations expressing a given OR. We recently reported that following in vivo odorant exposure of OSNs in the mouse, a decrease in the amount of mRNA encoding for the OR gene expressed by the activated neurons takes place 25 . Whether this odorant-induced decrease of mRNA concentration is limited to the receptor mRNA, or whether it is part of a broader activityinduced transcriptional alteration that could modulate the neuron's genetic identity, remains to be determined. In this work, we explored the transcriptional identities of olfactory neuronal populations and their modulation upon activation. We characterized the transcriptomes of several thousand mouse OSNs and uncovered a variability of profiles, each defined by the differential expression of numerous genes, and dependent on the expressed chemoreceptor. Following neuronal activation, we found that a second layer of transcriptome variability is added to this initial landscape. It results from the transcriptional modulation of hundreds of genes and represents a potential tool to adapt sensory responses to upcoming signals. Results Variable transcriptomes among OSN populations at rest. The main determinant of an OSN identity is the OR gene it expresses. In addition to this functional characteristic, a few genes have been described to be unequally expressed in different olfactory populations. These latter are however thought to be shared by large numbers of OSN populations (that is populations expressing different ORs), and to be involved in the topographic organization of the olfactory sensory mucosa, in which neurons expressing a given OR are restricted to specific zones. As an initial approach to determine potential differences in the identity of the various sensory neurons populating the main olfactory epithelium, we performed a single-cell RNA-seq of dissociated cells extracted from the nasal cavity of 8-week-old male mice (Fig. 1a ). The data were clustered and visualized on a UMAP plot (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We obtained a total of 15,859 cells, from which mature OSNs (expressing the Omp and Adcy3 genes) were readily distinguishable from immature neurons and non-neuronal cells (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a ), in agreement with previous observations 26 . A total of 9,539 mature OSNs (composed of 798 olfactory sensory populations of at least three neurons (Supplementary Fig. 2d )) expressing the olfactory marker gene Omp were then selected, and clustered again. Specific subclusters were observed (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2b ), that were defined by the expression of marker genes (Calb2, Cd36 and others), and that showed a clear separation between sensory neurons located ventrally (Nfix+) and dorsally (Nqo1+) in the nasal cavity (OSNs expressing specific ORs are unequally scattered across the nasal epithelium 27 ). We then explored the potential transcriptional proximity of neurons expressing the same OR. Their positions were visualized on the UMAP plot, which revealed a striking grouping of each of the different neuronal populations (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 4 ), ranging from dense transcriptomic clustering of some populations (such as those expressing Olfr354 or Olf553), to populations exhibiting a larger variance in gene expression (such as Olfr1183). To quantify this observation, we measured the pairwise transcriptomic distances (computed on the PC space used for clustering and UMAP plot generation) between pairs of sensory neurons expressing the same receptor (intra) and found that neurons expressing the same receptor were significantly more similar transcriptionally than those expressing different receptors (inter) (Fig. 1e , Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7 ). To determine the potential role played by the expression of the ORs themselves in this clustering, this latter was performed without taking the OR gene expression data into account. Remarkably, the grouping of populations expressing the same chemoreceptor, irrespective of whether the analysis was performed on the whole sensory population or a given subcluster (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 5 ), was maintained. These results were stable over a wide range of number of top PCs chosen for downstream analyses (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). To explore this ORassociated population specificity, we identified specific genes that were differentially expressed between the different neuronal populations (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2c ). These included genes that were either transcribed or whose transcripts were absent in the different populations such as Cidea, or that were expressed in a graded manner across most populations, such as S100a5. These transcriptomic profiles were not merely reflecting different general types of sensory neurons, since they were not only observed to be different between subclusters, but also within subclusters (Fig. 1g, h ). At rest, that is without active olfactory stimulation, a transcriptomic code thus characterizes each OR-defined population. Transcriptomic proximity versus olfactory receptor identity. What may determine the transcriptional distance between two neuronal populations expressing different ORs? Considering OSN maturation as a series of differentiation steps that at each increment determine more and more specific identities 26, 28 , transcriptomic distances between two mature sensory neuron populations may reflect how many of these steps they shared. If transcriptomic identity is largely determined prior to odorant gene choice, the closeness between two populations should be mirrored by their use of the same OR gene cis-regulatory element. These elements are known to be necessary for the choice of specific sets of OR genes and control small clusters of adjacent OR genes [29] [30] [31] [32] . Alternatively, or in addition to this first hypothesis, one could envisage a direct role played by the receptor itself, which may define a basal activity level in neurons for example, and a corresponding transcriptomic profile. We tested the first hypothesis by evaluating whether OR genes sharing a common enhancer are transcriptionally closer to each other than to those under the control of other cis-regulatory elements. We took advantage of two well defined cis-regulatory elements acting on mouse OR genes (the H and P elements), whose OR gene targets are quite dissimilar (Fig. 2a-d ), and have been well described [29] [30] [31] [32] . Calculating a centroid-based Euclidean distance between OSN population transcriptomes (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 8a ), we evaluated the similarity between the transcriptomes of sensory neuron subpopulations expressing OR genes under the control of the same cis-regulatory elements, as well as their neighbors (Fig. 2c, d ). No increase in transcriptomic similarity was observed between genes under the control of the H or P elements. To further explore this hypothesis, we took a global approach based on the possible link between the genomic distance separating OR genes and their difference in transcriptomic identity, the idea being again that since olfactory cisregulatory elements act on adjacent genes, those located in proximity may also result closer transcriptionally. Pairwise genomic distances between OR genes (Fig. 2b ) were calculated for all pairs of genes located in the same gene cluster and compared to the transcriptomic distance between the OSN populations expressing these ORs. A weak positive association between genomic and transcriptomic proximity was observed in the first 30% of the genomic distance value range (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 8f ). This association decreased when using a binning based on the intergenic distance between OR genes (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d ) and including approximately the first 10% of the genomic distance value range. This relationship was more visible when considering different equal width bins of the observed range of transcriptomic distances, in relation to the proportion of pairs of neighboring genes (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 8b, c ). We then evaluated our second hypothesis, which proposes that the ORs themselves define transcriptomic profiles. We determined the levels of sequence homology between ORs using Miyata scores (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 8e ) and tested their potential association with the transcriptomic distances between the corresponding neuronal populations. We found a positive association between transcriptomic proximity and OR sequence similarity in the first 30% of the amino acid difference value range (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 8g ), that was further supported by a clear overrepresentation of similar OR pairs in sensory populations that are transcriptionally close (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 8e ). Given this last observation and knowing that OR genes tend to duplicate in cis, it is likely that sequence identity is a confounding factor when measuring genomic proximity. To reevaluate whether genomic proximity plays indeed a role in addition to receptor identity, we took advantage of evolutionary accidents that led duplicated OR genes to land in close vicinity or distantly from their princeps allele. We thus evaluated the potential differences in transcriptional proximity between neuronal populations expressing ORs that are similar and associated in the genome, and neuronal populations expressing ORs that are similar but located in different gene clusters. In parallel, we evaluated the transcriptomic distances of neuronal populations expressing ORs that are dissimilar and are associated in the genome (Fig. 2g ). We found no significant difference in the average transcriptional distance between neurons expressing similar OR genes, whether these genes are located in proximity or are distant from each other. On the contrary, we found an increase in transcriptomic distances between dissimilar and similar ORs associated in the genome, supporting our second hypothesis, that is a role played by the OR identity in transcriptome determination. Activity-induced transcriptomic modulation in defined OSN populations. Following the identification of specific transcriptomic identities characterizing the different olfactory neuronal populations at rest, we explored their potential evolution after agonist activation. To address this question, we determined the transcriptome of defined and well described neuronal populations following exposure to odorants (Fig. 3a ). We used two knockin mouse lines, Olfr151 GFP/GFP and Olfr16 GFP/GFP , in which OSNs expressing the Olfr151 (M71) and the Olfr16 (MOR23) OR genes are modified such that when transcribed, a green fluorophore is coexpressed. These olfactory receptors have different sequences (Miyata Score=273.24), are expressed in different subzones of the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 3b, h ), are expressed in different basoapical layers (Fig. 3c, i ), and respond to different agonists. 12 live and freely moving mice were exposed for 5 h to acetophenone and lyral, two known agonists of Olfr151 and Olfr16, respectively 33, 34 (Fig. 3a ). To extract the most possible transcriptomic information, we did not opt here for a scRNA-seq approach but rather for the bulk sequencing of purified neuronal populations. Following exposure, fluorescent Olfr151-and Olfr16expressing neurons were isolated by FACS, and their transcriptomes were determined and analyzed. In all conditions, high amounts of transcripts of the OR gene corresponding to the targeted population were detected and sequence reads from other OR genes were almost absent (Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Significant and robust transcriptomic modulations were observed for both olfactory populations after agonist exposure, with 645 and 752 genes upregulated and downregulated respectively for Olfr151transcribing neurons, and 419 genes upregulated and 356 downregulated for Olfr16-transcribing neurons (Fig. 3d-g, j-m and Supplementary Data 1). The fold-change modulation ranged from 0.032 to 1505 and from 0.056 to 517 in the Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations, respectively (Fig. 3f, l ). To confirm the specificity of the transcriptional modulation, we performed single-molecule RNA in situ hybridization (via RNAscope) to evaluate expression levels of two genes of interest: Fig. 1 Variable odorant receptor-associated transcriptomes among olfactory sensory populations. a Schematic of the approach. b Main olfactory epithelium (MOE) cell clusters on a UMAP plot.

Mustn1, which we found to be highly upregulated in the FACSseq experiments, and Olfr16, which we expect to be downregulated upon activation (see Fig. 3d, e, j, k ). In mice exposed to lyral, the Olfr16-neuronal population showed significant upregulation of Mustn1, while the transcripts of the OR gene were downregulated (Fig. 3n-t ). Conversely, when mice were exposed to acetophenone, which is not a ligand for Olfr16, there was no transcriptional modulation occurring in the Olfr16-transcribing population (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). This confirms that the transcriptional modulations observed in the FACS-seq analysis are indeed triggered by the binding of agonists to the receptor defining the population, and not by aspecific activity within the olfactory sensory epithelium. Common activity-induced transcriptomic adaptation in different OSN populations. Taking advantage of our double approach and to potentially extract general rules, we compared the transcriptomic modulations of the Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations after agonist exposure (Fig. 4a ). In accordance with our initial observations describing significant transcriptomic distances between populations expressing different receptors, we first observed that the transcriptomes of Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing neurons were significantly dissimilar (882 genes were differentially expressed between the two neuron populations (Fig. 4b-e ). Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations, several genes related to axon guidance were identified, such as Pcdh7, Pcdh9, Nrp1, and Sema7A (Supplementary Data 2). We then compared the activity-induced modulated genes between the Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations (Fig. 4f-h ), that without surprise, showed again a significant difference between populations. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the Olfr151 and Olfr16 transcriptomic sets, before and after agonist exposure, showed 39% of variance explained by cell identity, and 20% of variance by activity. The overlap between the activity-induced responses of the Olf151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations was further explored by comparing their potentially common down and upregulated genes. A significant proportion of these genes were shared, 215 (51.3%) and 134 (37.6%) of them being commonly upregulated and downregulated, respectively (Fig. 4i ). In both Olfr151-and Olfr16-activated populations, the dispersion of downregulated genes decreased, while it increased for upregulated genes; this was also true for the genes shared by both populations (Supplementary Fig. 11 ). We then aimed to functionally interpret our data by attributing Gene Ontology (GO) terms to the activity-dependent modulated genes common to the Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations. Among the significantly enriched terms, we found "signaling" and "Gprotein-coupled receptor activity" in the GO biological processes terms, "molecular transducer activity" in the GO molecular functions category, and "plasma membrane" and "cell periphery" in the GO cellular components category (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Table 2 ). A pattern thus emerged, pointing to actors of the transduction cascade being modulated by agonist exposure. We finally looked at genes that were modulated after activation in one OSN population and not in the other (fold change after activation < 0.5 for downregulated genes and >2 for upregulated genes, Supplementary Data 3). Among these genes, we observed that a large proportion encoded transcription factors (8.2% and 7.1% for Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations, respectively, to be compared to 5% observed in commonly modulated genes). Modulation of transcription following odorant exposure. Modulations in mRNA concentration may result from various processes. Among them and first in line, the regulation of transcriptional activity and the modulation of mRNA half-life. Our previous work has pointed to a rapid downregulation of OR gene mRNA concentration following odor exposure (as fast as 20 min), and in some cases an almost absence of OR mRNA 5 h after stimulation 25 . This nearly immediate modulation and complete loss of messenger is suggestive, or at least compatible with an active degradation of cytosolic mRNAs. To explore this question, we took advantage of the different characteristics of nascent and mature mRNAs, namely the presence and lack of intronic sequences, respectively. We first analyzed the exonic versus intronic reads of the modulated genes that we identified after odorant exposure of Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing neurons (Fig. 5a ). Following agonist exposure, a large portion of the genes whose modulation was determined after analysis of exonic reads, were also modulated, both up and down and in both Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing neurons, when restricting the analysis to intronic reads (Fig. 5b -g and Supplementary Fig. 12 ). To further explore this question, we exposed wild type mice to ethyl isobutyrate (Fig. 5h ), an agonist for which we previously determined a set of highly responsive OR genes, among which Olfr60, Olfr166, Olfr169, and Olfr171, whose corresponding mRNA concentrations drastically decrease after exposure 25 . We evaluated this potential modulation at the level of nascent mRNAs. We observed a downregulation of OR mRNAs that was similar using exonic and intronic reads as readouts (Fig. 5i ) (although, for some OR genes, the number of intronic reads in the bulk RNA-seq was too low to evaluate differential expression (Supplementary Fig. 13 )). Finally, we looked at the cellular localization of transcripts (Fig. 5h ). We took advantage of the high level of OR transcription that makes nascent transcripts easily visualized using in situ hybridization. Since OR genes are transcribed monoallelically, a single nuclear transcriptional spot corresponding to their expressed OR gene is observed in the nucleus of each sensory neuron (Fig. 5j ). We exposed wild type mice to ethyl isobutyrate and performed in situ hybridizations with a probe specific for Olfr171, whose mRNA we previously showed to be modulated following ethyl isobutyrate stimulation. We quantified the intensity of the nuclear signal, before and after agonist exposure, and found a significant decrease in signal intensity after ethyl isobutyrate exposure (Fig. 5j ). Taken together, these data all point to an odorant-induced modulation of transcription, and not to a mechanism involving degradation or stabilization of mature mRNAs. Discussion In this work, we took advantage of the unique opportunity provided by the mouse olfactory epithelium, which contains hundreds of singular cell subpopulations, each defined by the expression of a known chemoreceptor gene, and activable at will. We first characterized the transcriptomes of these subpopulations in a basal state, at rest, that is in mice living in their usual environment without exposure to specific olfactory stimuli. Second, by activating defined OSN subpopulations in vivo using odorants, we further explored how these neurons adapt to environmental changes. We found that the transcriptomic identity of mouse OSNs is remarkably variable, a variability that results from the apparent interplay of two dimensions: a first, steady state transcriptomic identity that characterizes each OSN population, to which a second is added, following the recent odor-driven activity of the sensory neuron. What does determine the transcriptomic identities of OSN populations? It is the expressed OR that appears to be the main factor in the establishment of these identities. Our data indeed show that transcriptomic similarities are better predicted by receptor similarities than by shared OR regulatory sequences. In agreement with our data, the importance of the OR in the establishment of the transcriptional identity was shown in a recently published manuscript 35 . We showed here that odorant recognition triggers OSN transcriptomic modulation, that not only includes the downregulation of the expressed OR genes 25 , but the up-and downregulation of hundreds of additional ones. By comparing the agonist response of two olfactory populations expressing different ORs and responding to different odorants, we found a significant overlap between activity-modulated genes. These represent late responsive genes (in opposition to early response genes), typically encoding proteins that regulate dendritic growth, synapse elimination or spine maturation 10 . For example, a gene that was significantly upregulated in both Olfr151-and Olfr16-populations upon activation was the late responsive gene Mustn1, whose transcription is regulated by immediate early genes including c-Fos and JunD 36 . Mustn1 may constitute an activity marker in OSNs, although additional experiments would be required to generalize this observation. More generally, in our case most modulated genes pertain to signal transduction categories, which possibly reflects the peculiarly ordered and relatively invariant olfactory circuitry. Interestingly, among the main genes involved in the olfactory transduction cascade, including those coding for ORs, GnaI, Adcy3, Cnga2, Cngb1b, or Cnga4, none were upregulated after odorant-mediated activation, and most were Fig. 3 Odorant-induced transcriptomic modulations. a Schematic of the experiment. After being exposed to their cognate ligand for 5 h, fluorescent neurons from Olfr151 GFP/GFP and Olfr16 GFP/GFP mice were FAC-sorted and total mRNA was sequenced. b, c Coronal section of an Olfr151 GFP/GFP mouse main olfactory epithelium (MOE) containing GFP-expressing neurons (green, endogenous GFP) and stained with DAPI (blue).

This parallels the data presented by Tsukahara et al. in which most of these genes were also found modulated after naris occlusion and long-term odorant exposure 35 . Such transcriptomic contraction affecting all members of the olfactory cascade suggests a functional transcriptional adaptation, leading in the case of a sustained odorant exposure to a decreased response to the experienced odor. Such an adaptive mechanism would not be surprising, since functional plasticity of sensory inputs mediated by olfactory stimulation has been observed 37 . We also report different transcriptomic identities of OSN populations at rest (that is in the absence of actively exposing mice to odors). In this almost silent state, how does the olfactory receptor translate its identity to the OSNs that express it? One may argue, as Tsukahara et al. 35 that some OSNs expressing -log 10 adjusted p-value Olfr16 specific ORs will fire in a nose even without experimental stimulation, as some volatile molecules are always present in the environment. But we rather suggest that there is an inherent activity state that may characterize each sensory population at rest, that translates into a specific transcriptomic identity. This last view is supported by the observation that the elimination of odorantinduced activity through naris occlusion does not abolish transcriptomic variability between OSN populations 35 . Moreover, also supporting this view, it was previously shown that OSN populations expressing different ORs exhibit different basal activity levels, that is levels of basal transduction activity and fluctuation of currents, which drive concomitant firing of action potentials 38, 39 . Even in the absence of odor-stimulation, OSNs are indeed characterized by high adenylate cyclase 3 activity and by large fluctuations in cAMP levels 39, 40 , both of which are suggestive of intrinsic OR activity. An interesting candidate mechanism for the generation of such odorant receptor-dependent and odorant-independent graded cellular states is the agonist-independent natural basal activity of G-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Both GPCRs and other ligandactivated receptors are indeed known to spontaneously oscillate between two conformations, one active and the other inactive, in the absence of ligands [41] [42] [43] (in the presence of these latter, the receptors are stabilized in an active state 44 ). For GPCRs, this effect was already observed over 30 years ago with the delta opioid receptor 45 . Since then, and despite being often considered as noise, many more examples of such constitutive GPCR activity have been reported (with some receptors exhibiting high levels of agonistindependent activity such as the Ghrelin receptor 46 ), as well as various diseases associated with GPCR mutations affecting this constitutive activity. In the olfactory system, odorant-independent OSN basal activity has also been described in the context of axon guidance, where it plays an important role in regulating anterior-posterior targeting of OSN axons during development 47 . Constitutive OR activity thus appears to produce several different cellular states, whose number would be sufficient for defining enough nonoverlapping neuronal categories to which distinctive rostrocaudal projection positions are assigned. The extent to which odor-induced activity experienced during development may influence the establishment of the glomerular map in addition to intrinsic activity, remains to be explored in details. Finally, we identified the process at the origin of the agonistinduced variations of mRNA concentrations, which appears not to involve the half-life of mRNAs nor the nuclear export of these latter, but the modulation of transcription itself. Which molecular players are involved in this process is still unknown, but obvious candidates come to mind, such as the cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB), a transcription factor critical for activitydependent neuronal plasticity 10 that is involved in the activationinduced prolonged lifespan of OSNs 48 . The mammalian olfactory mucosa thus represents a multifunctional sensor whose neuronal elements, that use olfactory receptors as internal and external chemical probes, are in constant evolution, adapting to the world via the activation of largescale transcriptomic programs. Whether this transcriptomic diversity and dynamics functionally parallels the one recently observed in some central structures [49] [50] [51] [52] , and whether the molecular tools involved in transcriptomic adjustments are shared between different circuits, remains to be explored. Given the transcriptomic diversity of neurons in the mammalian brain and knowing that 90% of non-sensory GPCRs are expressed in mammalian brains, the question is worth asking. Methods Animals. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the veterinary guidelines and regulations of the University and of the state of Geneva (Direction de l'expérimentation animale de l'UNIGE). C57BL/6J male mice were purchased at 5-7 weeks of age from Charles River Laboratories. Upon arrival, they were housed in groups of 4-5 animals. The following transgenic mouse lines were employed: Olfr16-IRES-tau-GFP (Olfr16 tm2Mom , referred to as Olfr16 GFP/GFP ), Olfr151-IREStau-GFP (Olfr151 tm26Mom , referred to as Olfr151 GFP/GFP ) [53] [54] [55] . Transgenic mice were backcrossed on C57BL/6J background for over ten generations. Transgenic mice were bred and maintained at the University of Geneva. All mice were housed in standard type II cages with access to food and water ad libitum, on a dark/light cycle of 12/12 h, temperature between 21 and 22 °C, humidity between 45 and 55%. 10X single-cell RNA sequencing Cell isolation, sorting, and sequencing. 8 weeks old male C57BL/6J mice were used (n = 4). All experiments were performed during daytime. Mice were euthanized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) and their olfactory epithelia were immediately extracted and processed for tissue dissociation using the Papain Dissociation System (cat #LK003150; Worthington® Biochemical Corporation, New Jersey, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cell suspensions were then incubated with 2 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (a UV fluorescent adenine-thymine binding dye; #H1399, Life Technologies) at 37 °C for 15 min. Before fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and to exclude dead cells, 1 μM of DRAQ7™ (a far-red fluorescent DNA intercalating dye; #DR71000, BioStatus) was added to the cell suspensions. Approximately 80,000 Hoechst+/DRAQ7-cells were collected from each sample, each in a final volume of 100 μl. After FACS sorting, cell suspensions were concentrated at 800 cells/μl. The targeted cell recovery was set to 10,000. In accordance with the Cell Suspension Volume Calculator Table of 10X Genomics, 22.6 μl of nuclease-free water was added to 20.6 μl of cell suspension and the samples were loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium controller. GEM generation and barcoding, cDNA amplification and cDNA library construction were performed following the 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Fig. 4 Shared odorant-induced transcriptomic modulations between different olfactory populations. a Schematic of the experiment.

The dashed line corresponds to the significant threshold (adjusted p values < 0.05). Raw p values were extracted with Fisher's exact test and then adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Single-Cell 3′ v3.1 protocol (dual index libraries). The cDNA libraries from each sample were then pooled and loaded at 2 nM on 2 lanes of the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system for paired-end sequencing. scRNA-seq mapping and counting. fastq files were pre-processed with Cell Ranger version 6.0.1 56 with default settings. Reads were mapped on the Mus musculus genome primary assembly reference 38 (GRCm38) using the STAR aligner 57 the following steps. First, the four 10X gene expression matrix files were individually loaded into R using the Read10x function of Seurat. The 10X data were then converted to Seurat objects using the CreateSeuratObject function of Seurat. The gene expression data was then normalized using the SCTransform function of Seurat 60 , and the top 5000 variable genes were determined for datasets integration 61, 62 . Following the integration of the four datasets, a preliminary clustering was performed without any additional cell filtering in order to identify and remove cell clusters composed of blood, immune or suffering cells (i.e., cells exhibiting high expression levels of mitochondrial genes). PCA was performed on the integrated assay of the Seurat object using the RunPCA function of Seurat. A visual inspection of their explained standard deviation led to the selection of the top 9 PCs for subsequent cell clustering. To construct a shared nearest-neighbor graph, the above-mentioned PCs were used as input to the FindNeighbors function of Seurat (dims = 1:9). Cell clusters were then identified using the FindClusters function of Seurat with a clustering resolution of 1.1. This preliminary clustering yielded 28 cell clusters. Cluster-specific gene markers were then identified for cluster annotation. Briefly, the raw dataset containing cells sampled from all four mice was normalized by library size, scaled to 10 4 and natural-log-transformed after adding a pseudocount of 1 using the NormalizeData function of Seurat. This normalized data was then used for differential expression analysis computed between each cell cluster and all other clusters taken together using the Wilcoxon rank sum test implemented in the FindAllMarkers function of Seurat (test.use = "wilcox"; only.pos = TRUE). Only genes with an adjusted p value below 0.05 were considered. Two blood cell clusters (n = 2) were identified based on their high expression of Ptprc and hemoglobin chain complex genes such as Hba-a1 and Hba-a2 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Immune cell clusters (n = 7) were identified based on their high expression of known immune cells markers such as Igkc, Cd52, Cybb, Ctss, Tyrobp, and Gypa (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Suffering cell clusters (n = 4) were identified based on their high percentage of mitochondrial gene counts. This preliminary clustering led to the removal of 13 cell clusters from the dataset (n = 4708 cells). Furthermore, cells were also filtered out if their percentage of mitochondrial counts exceeded 10% of their total counts or if they expressed <1000 genes (n = 1242 cells). This preliminary analysis resulted in retaining 15,859 cells. scRNA-seq clustering and analysis of main olfactory epithelium cells. The retained cells were used to identify cell clusters composing the mouse main olfactory epithelium (MOE). The corresponding datasets (one per mouse) were normalized and integrated, and cell clusters were identified as described in the previous paragraph (see scRNA-seq data filtering) with the following differences: the first 13 PCs were used for the FindNeighbors function of Seurat and a resolution of 0.3 was used for the FindClusters function of Seurat. This analysis led to the identification of 15 cell clusters. Cluster identities were then determined from the DEGs in each cluster (see above for more details). The markers described in Fletcher et al. 26 were used for the annotation of the mouse MOE cell types. From the 15 clusters, 5 corresponded to mature OSNs based on their high expression of Omp, Cnga2, and Gng13 but not Gap43 (Supplementary Fig. 2a ) These clusters were then merged together into only one cluster of mature OSN (Fig. 1b ). To visualize the resulting 10 cell clusters on a 2-dimensional plot, the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) 63, 64 plot was computed using the RunUMAP function of Seurat and the first 13 PCs previously selected (dims = 1:13) (Fig. 1b ). Mature OSNs were selected from the main olfactory epithelium dataset for downstream analyses (n = 10,519 cells). For each mature OSN, the detected olfactory receptors were ordered based on their expression levels: 7025 OSNs displayed the expression of a single olfactory receptor, 2655 OSNs displayed the expression of two olfactory receptors and 684 OSNs displayed the expression of at least three olfactory receptors. To remove cells that could correspond to multiplets (among those co-expressing multiple olfactory receptors), the distribution of the expression levels of the highest expressed receptors was analyzed using the log-normalized data. An "is expressed" cutoff was set at three median absolute deviations from the median of the levels of expression of the highest expressed receptors. OSNs whose highest expressed receptor had an expression level below this cutoff were removed from the dataset (n = 229 cells). Moreover, OSNs that expressed more than one receptor at an expression level higher than this cutoff were also filtered out from the dataset (n = 344 cells). Finally, roughly 1.5% of the mature OSNs (n = 155 cells) did not show receptor expression and were also discarded from the dataset. The OSN population identity of each of the remaining cells (n = 9791 cells) was then determined based on the olfactory receptor that displayed the highest expression level in that given cell. This led to the identification of 952 OR-expressing OSN populations (n = 9741 cells) and 7 TAAR-expressing OSN populations (n = 44 cells), as well as a Gucy1b2-expressing OSN population (n = 6 cells). OSN populations represented by at least 3 cells in the dataset were included for clustering and downstream analyses (n = 9539 cells). Two parallel analyses were carried out: by keeping or removing the olfactory receptor genes from the count matrix. The corresponding datasets were normalized and integrated, and cell clusters were identified as described above (see scRNA-seq data filtering), but with a substantial modification in the way PCs were chosen for downstream analyses. Rather than selecting the PCs by relying on the visual inspection of their explained standard deviation, the KneeLocator function of the kneed python package version 0.7.0 65 was used with the following parameters: S = 1, curve = "convex", direction = "decreasing". This algorithm was applied on the explained standard deviation of the top 50 PCs to detect the elbow in the decrease of the explained standard deviation of the successive PCs (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b, d, e ). The location of the elbow was then used as a threshold to retain the top relevant PCs for downstream processing of the datasets. The analyses described in scRNA-seq data filtering were thus carried out with the following differences: the percentage of mitochondrial gene counts were used as confounder variables in the SCTransform function of Seurat (vars.to.regress = "percent.mt"); the first 14 or 15 PCs (explaining 47% and 48% of the variance calculated with the top 50 PCs, respectively) were used for the FindNeighbors and RunUMAP functions of Seurat for the analyses including or not the olfactory receptor genes, respectively; and a resolution of 2.1 or 1.6 was used for the FindClusters function of Seurat for the analyses including or not the olfactory receptor genes, respectively. These concurrent analyses led to the identification of 29 (including olfactory receptor genes) or 23 (not including olfactory receptor genes) cell clusters, respectively. Cluster identities were then determined from the DEGs in each cluster (see scRNAseq data filtering for more details). After cluster merging, a total of 10 clusters were retained, which were then subdivided into groups of "dorsal" or "ventral" clusters based on their complementary expression of Nqo1 (a dorsal mature OSN gene marker) or Nfix (a ventral mature OSN gene marker), respectively. These broad clusters were each composed of five subclusters characterized by their expression of specific markers genes or absence of them: Dlg2+, Calb2+, Cd55+, Cd36+ and Dlg2-; Calb2-; Cd55-; Cd36-clusters. The clustering similarity between the two analyses (i.e., including or excluding the olfactory receptor genes) was computed with the normalized mutual information metric using the compare function of the igraph R package version 1.2.6 (method = "nmi"). Similar to what was performed per cluster, OSN population-specific gene markers were identified using the log-normalized UMI counts and the FindAllMarkers function of Seurat (test.use = "wilcox"; only.pos = TRUE). In Fig. 1g , the largest OSN population from each cluster was selected and the gene expression levels of its cells were compared to those of all other cells from the dataset. In Fig. 1h , the six largest OSN populations from the Dlg2-, Calb2-, Cd36-, Cd55-ventral cluster were selected and for each of these populations the gene expression levels of their cells were compared to those of all other cells from that specific cluster. Only genes expressed in at least 70% of the cells of the given population and that yielded an adjusted p value below 0.05 were considered. For plotting, the log-normalized data was scaled and centered using the ScaleData Fig. 5 Odorant-induced modulations of mRNA levels result from transcriptional regulation. a Schematic of the experiment.

Transcriptomic, genomic, and amino acid distances Transcriptomic Euclidean distance calculation between pairs of OSNs. To test whether OSN populations (defined by the OR gene they express) are transcriptionally dissimilar from each other, the pairwise transcriptomic Euclidean distances between pairs of OSNs were computed on the first 15 PCs of the mature OSN dataset devoid of OR gene counts (computed from the sctransformnormalized and integrated count matrix; see scRNA-seq data filtering for more details). The Euclidean distances were calculated on the PC space used for clustering and UMAP representation, rather than the gene counts, to faithfully represent and quantify the co-clustering of OSNs expressing the same receptor observed in Fig. 1d . Note that when the analysis was performed on the mature OSN dataset including the OR gene counts, the top 14 PCs were used (the right part of Fig. 1e ; with OR genes). In Fig. 1e and Supplementary Figs. 5 6 7 , pairwise Euclidean distances were calculated between pairs of OSNs pertaining to populations represented by at least 3 cells in the dataset. These distances were sorted into two categories: distances between pairs of OSNs expressing the same olfactory receptor (intra) or pairs expressing different receptors (inter). To compare and measure the dissimilarity between these two distributions of pairwise transcriptomic Euclidean distances, the Cohen's d was calculated between the intra and inter distributions (Fig. 1e ) using the cohen.d function of the effectsize R package version 0.8.1 with default settings 67 . Moreover, to test if the difference in the distributions of Euclidean distances between pairs of OSNs expressing the same or different olfactory receptors was not a random effect, we generated a permuted dataset by randomly redistributing the cell identities (and hence the corresponding OR identities) of the top 15 PCs and recalculated pairwise distances for OSNs with identical random identities (intra perm). By iterating this process, the random distribution was estimated from 1000 permuted datasets. As described above, the Cohen's d was then calculated between the intra or inter OSN population transcriptomic Euclidean distance distributions and each of the permuted distributions. This resulted in 1000 Cohen's d values for each set of comparisons (i.e., intra versus intra perm and inter versus intra perm). The two distributions of Cohen's d values were then compared using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. When this analysis was performed on each cluster separately, the original PC space was used for distance calculation but only the distances between cells from that given cluster were retained for the analysis, and the p values of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction method, as indicated in the figure legends. Evaluation of the effect of PC choice on transcriptomic Euclidean distances between pairs of OSNs. To evaluate the effect of the choice of PCs on the results obtained, the Cohen's d values were calculated to measure the dissimilarity between the distributions of intra and inter OSN population pairwise transcriptomic Euclidean distances, as described in the previous paragraph, when varying the number of top PCs used for the analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3c, f ). We found that the discriminability between the intra and inter OSN population transcriptomic Euclidean distances reaches a plateau with the top 11 PCs (or higher), and the computational approach to select the top PCs for downstream analysis is robust and allows to capture most of the OSN population-based variance in the dataset. Evaluation of the effect of dataset integration on transcriptomic Euclidean distances between pairs of OSNs. Though dataset integration corrects for batch effects found in the data, it also alters the gene expression profile of the cells. When dataset integration is performed, shared cell types are identified between datasets and their gene expression profiles are "corrected" (i.e., altered) so to remove batch effects that might hamper their co-clustering during downstream analysis. Given the differences in the frequencies of OSN populations, dataset integration might impact differently small and large OSN populations. For the large OSN populations, whose cells were sampled from most if not all mice, dataset integration might only correct for batch effects found between the individual datasets, as the search for common cell types (i.e., anchors) between the datasets might result in the identification of cells expressing the same OR. This is not the case for small OSN populations whose cells are sampled from a few of the mice used in this experiment. For example, an OSN population formed of 3 cells can be sampled from only one mouse, and therefore none of the datasets from the other mice would contain cells from that given population. A byproduct of this could be the alteration of the transcriptomic profiles of two small OSN populations so to make them more similar for dataset integration, especially since the OR gene expression information was removed from the dataset, which could have helped to discriminate these two populations. In other words, the neighbors of cells from a given small OSN population sampled from a given mouse can be identified as the cells pertaining to another small OSN population sampled from another mouse. Hence, in this case, the search for neighbors between the datasets can be biased towards small OSN populations. To evaluate this, OSN populations were binned based on their size into equal frequency bins and the two extreme bins (one formed by populations of small sizes, and the other of large sizes) were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7a ). Subsequently, the inter OSN population pairwise transcriptomic distances between pairs of OSNs from each of the two bins were subsampled to include the distances between 1/3 of the OSNs from each population, and the subsampled distances were compared to each other and to all intra OSN population distances using Cohen's d as described above (see Transcriptomic Euclidean distance calculation between pairs of OSNs). This process was repeated 10,000 times, hence resulting in 10,000 Cohen's d values for each set of comparisons (i.e., inter small versus inter large, inter small versus intra, and inter large versus intra) (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c ). In parallel, the analysis detailed in Transcriptomic Euclidean distance calculation between pairs of OSNs was also performed for each mouse without dataset integration (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Following PC selection using the kneed python package described above, the analysis was computed on the top 14 PCs for mouse 1, the top 12 PCs for mouse 2, the top 10 PCs for mouse 3, and the top 14 PCs for mouse 4. Transcriptomic Euclidean distance calculation between OSN populations. To compare the transcriptomic Euclidean distances between OSN populations with the genomic or phylogenetic distances between the olfactory receptors they express, population transcriptomic distances were calculated on the same PC space used for clustering and UMAP representation (i.e., top 15 PCs of the mature OSN dataset without OR gene counts). To this end, OSN population centroids were estimated on the PC space and the distances between the centroids were used as a proxy for the distances between pairs of OSN populations (Fig. 2e -g and Supplementary Fig. 8d ). To reduce small sample biases in centroid estimations, this analysis was restricted to OSN populations represented by at least 10 cells in the dataset. Functional OR gene identification and OR phylogeny. The functional OR phylogeny was partly built from the same sequence set as used in von der Weid et al. 25 . To constitute this set, OR coding sequences were identified de novo in the mouse genome assembly GRCm38 using TBLASTN searches with previously annotated mouse OR protein sequences as queries. The hits were manually curated to filter out putative non-functional receptors. The criteria to consider an OR to be functional was the conservation of evolutionary constrained residues 68 , the integrity of the seven transmembrane domains and the absence of intron within the coding sequence 69 , resulting in a set of 1141 putatively functional OR. After this filtering, 11 filtered out ORs were retrieved as they were found to be expressed in a monoallelic fashion in one or more OSNs, in our scRNA-seq data. For these ORs, we used coding sequences as annotated in Ensembl version 102. Notably, 8 of these 11 ORs have their coding sequence spanning two exons, with most of the coding sequence (covering the seven transmembrane domains) included in the last exon. A multiple sequence alignment including the resulting OR protein sequence set was obtained with Clustal Omega v1.2.4 70 , using the-full and-full-iter options. The resulting alignment was trimmed to keep the sites between the most conserved start methionines and the last position with less than 90% of gaps. The maximum likelihood phylogeny of the mouse functional ORs was calculated with Phyml version 20120412 71 using the following parameters: -d aa -m JTT -f e -v e -c 4 -a e -s BEST -o tlr. The resulting tree was rooted on the node at the origin of class I and class II ORs. For display of transcriptomic identities of associated OR in Fig. 2a , each OSN population was assigned to the transcriptomic cluster to which the majority of cells belong. In case of equivalences, we assigned the transcriptomic cluster randomly. Branch tips were colored according to the assigned transcriptome cluster identity of OSNs expressing the corresponding OR. Genomic distances and gene cluster definition. Pairwise genomic distance between OR genes was measured as the distance in base pairs between start codons of OR genes. For the 8 OR genes that have their start codon on another exon, we instead used the first position of the last coding exon. Genomic distances were only obtained between genes in the same chromosome. Pairwise distances between adjacent genes were used to aggregate OR genes in cluster. For this, the sorted distances were split into two groups using the Jenks natural break optimization for k = 3. In that manner, the middle break is used to separate unbiasedly two categories of distances: the smaller distances representing the intracluster distances and the longer distances representing the intercluster distances. Next, we calculated the mean and the standard deviation of the intracluster distances and defined the clustering threshold as the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation. Finally, gene clusters were obtained by aggregating neighboring genes whose genomic distance was closer to each other than the clustering threshold. Amino acid difference metric. Pairwise amino acid difference was measured on the protein alignment that was used for the phylogenetic reconstruction. For a given pair of aligned sequences, each substitution was scored according to the Miyata amino acid replacement matrix 72 . Insertions were scored as the mean replacement scores of each additional amino acid. The sum of these scores gave the pairwise amino acid difference. Evaluation of genomic proximity and sequence identity as determinants for transcriptome identity. In Fig. 2f , we defined thresholds of genomic distance and amino acid difference to attribute pairs of OSN populations as being close in terms of genomic proximity between the OR genes they express or in terms of sequence identity between their respective OR. For genomic proximity, we evaluated all intergenic distances between neighboring ORs belonging to the same cluster and chose the 95th percentile of this distribution as the threshold value for a pair to be considered close. For sequence identity, we evaluated all pairwise amino acid differences between ORs belonging to the same class and chose the 5th percentile of this distribution as the threshold value for a pair to be considered close. For Fig. 2g , a pair was considered distant in terms of genomic proximity when the corresponding OR genes were located in different OR gene cluster. A pair was considered distant in terms of sequence identity when the amino acid difference between their corresponding ORs was higher than the threshold used to identify the close pairs. Chemicals. Odorants were directly purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, ethyl isobutyrate (W242802), acetophenone (42163). Lyral was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Christian Margot (Firmenich). Odorant exposure. For all odorant exposures, on the day preceding the odorant exposure mice were isolated and single-housed in a standard type II long cage. Exposure assays started at 8:00 a.m. and lasted 5 h. For the exposed condition, a cotton swab was imbibed with 200 µL of 5% odorant in a DMSO solution and was placed in the cage, while for the control condition, a cotton swab was imbibed with 200 µL of DMSO only and was placed in the cage. FACS-seq Cell isolation, sorting, and sequencing. 7 weeks old Olfr16 GFP/GFP and Olfr151 GFP/GFP male mice were used to isolate single fluorescent OSN populations from the whole MOE. Mice were exposed as described above to lyral and acetophenone, respectively. Control mice from each transgenic line were exposed to DMSO only. For each condition, there were 3 samples, where each sample was constituted by a pool of 4 mice. After odorant exposure, mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg), the whole MOE was extracted and OSNs were dissociated by adapting the protocol described in Kaur et al. 73 . Briefly, the collected epithelia were minced inside a tube containing a dissociation buffer (D-csyteine-HCl 1 M, EDTA 100 mM, Papain 0.3U/µL, DNAse I (Ambion) 2 U/µL and DNAse I 10× buffer (Ambion), dissolved in freshly prepared and oxygenated cold aCSF). The aCSF composition was the following: 118 mM NaCl, 25 mM NahCO3, 10 mM D-glucose, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2. Samples were then placed at 37 °C for a total of 25 min allowing enzymatic dissociation of the tissues, during which they were subjected to a trituration step every 5 min using polished glass pipettes. At the end of the dissociation, each sample was filtered through a 20 µm Nylon filter (Falcon), and centrifuged for 5 min at 200G. The supernatant was discarded and replaced with ice-cold aCSF. Before FAC-sorting, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with Hoechst 33,342 (1 mg/mL) to label live cells. Cell-sorting was performed on an AriaII (BD Biosciences) cell-sorter, gated on Hoechst and GFP fluorescence. Cells were collected directly in lysis buffer from the Qiagen RNeasy plus micro kit. For the Olfr16 GFP/GFP mice, 100 cells were collected per individual, resulting in 400 cells per biological pool. For the Olfr151 GFP/GFP mice, 50 cells were collected per individual, resulting in 200 cells per biological pool. The difference in the total number of cells collected per experiment derives from the original respective OSN population sizes in the epithelium 74 . The RNA extraction was performed according to the Qiagen RNeasy plus micro kit protocol. The SMARTer™ Ultra Low RNA kit from Clontech was used for reverse transcription and cDNA amplification (12 PCR cycles) according to the manufacturer's specifications, starting with a total volume of 9.5 µL per sample as total RNA input. 200 pg of cDNA were used for library preparation using the Nextera XT kit from Illumina. Library molarity and quality was assessed with the Qubit and Tapestation using a DNA High sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were pooled at equimolarity and loaded at 11 pM for clustering on a Single-read Illumina Flow cell for the Olfr16 GFP/GFP experiment. Reads of 50 bases were generated using the SBS HS v3 chemistry on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer. Deep sequencing of the Olfr16 dataset yielded a mean of 37.2 M (±1.3 M) short single-reads for the control condition, and a mean of 35.4 M (±4 M) short single-reads for the exposed condition. For the Olfr151 experiment, libraries were loaded at 2 nM for clustering on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer. Deep sequencing of the Olfr151 dataset yielded a mean of 58.5 M (±1.5 M) short single-reads for the control condition, and a mean of 62.1 M (±1.3 M) short singlereads for the exposed condition. FACS-seq mapping and counting. STAR (v.2.7.0) 57 was used to map the generated reads on the Ensembl Mus musculus genome primary assembly ref. 38 (GRCm38) that included the IRES-tau-GFP sequence. Gene expression quantification was carried out using featureCounts version 1.6.3 75 . FACS-seq data filtering. To filter out lowly-and non-expressed genes for each OSN population (Olfr16 and Olfr151), a count threshold was determined to exclude all genes with expression values below this threshold across either the 3 control or 3 exposed samples. Briefly, the density distribution of gene counts was used to calculate the local minimum and this value was set as the threshold. FACS-seq gene expression analysis. The DESeq2 package (v.1.30.1) was then used to perform differential expression analysis. After fitting a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM), the Wald test (two-tailed) was used to test for significance of gene expression at a log 2 fold-change threshold of 0.5. To control the false discovery rate, the Wald test p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure 76 . Fold changes of DEGs were estimated using the apeglm R package version 1.16.0. Gene Ontology enrichment analyses. All GO enrichment analyses were performed testing GO terms mapped to the DEGs common to both analyzed OSN populations (Olfr16 and Olfr151) against a background of GO terms mapped to all other genes commonly expressed in both OSN populations. DEGs were analyzed for GO enrichment by the topGO package using the runTest function with the "classic" algorithm and the Fischer statistics. To control the false discovery rate, the p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure 76 . The result of the GO terms analysis were then plotted with the ggplot2 function in R. Bulk RNA-seq. The raw data generated in this experiment was previously published in von der Weid et al. 25 . Bulk RNA-seq mapping and counting. The mapping and counting of bulk RNA-seq data was performed exactly as described for FACS-seq data above (FACS-seq mapping and counting, data filtering and expression analysis). Exon-intron split analysis. Using the STAR read aligner tool (v.2.7.0) 57 , reads from the FACS-seq and 8 weeks old male RNA-seq experiments were mapped to the Mus musculus Ensembl transcriptome reference (GRCm38 from Ensembl). The annotation file used for this analysis only contained protein coding gene annotations. Gene expression quantification was carried out using featureCounts 75 version 1.6.3. To quantify intronic reads for a specific gene, we subtracted the reads mapped on the exon from the reads mapped to the entire transcript. For data shown in Fig. 5c, d, f, g , for each gene and feature counted (i.e., exonic or intronic reads), the DESeq2 normalized counts of the exposed samples were normalized by the mean DESeq2 normalized counts of the control samples. Hence, each dot on the plot corresponds to an odorant-exposed sample. The values on the y-axis are raw fold-change values, but the scale of the y-axis is in log 2. For Fig. 5i , given the low amount of intronic reads in OR genes, we only show OR genes with more than 14 intronic read counts. To this list, we added Olfr171, as it was described in Fig. 5j . Transcriptional downregulation of intronic and exonic features in exposed mice was tested by a two-sample independent t test using a linear model in R. P values were adjusted using the FDR method. To represent the raw data of the exon-intron split analysis prior to fold-change calculation (shown in Supplementary Fig. 12 ), we centered and scaled (i.e., z-scored) the DESeq2 normalized counts of all samples per gene and features counted (i.e., exonic or intronic reads). In situ hybridization. C57BL/6 J adult male mice were exposed to odorants for 1 h (four mice exposed to ethyl isobutyrate, four mice exposed to DMSO only), after which they were euthanized. Heads were placed in 10% formalin, purged of gas, left overnight at 4 °C, transferred to 15% sucrose for 12 h, followed by 30% sucrose for 12 h. They were embedded in OCT and frozen. The main olfactory epithelium was cut in 16-18 μm coronal sections with a cryostat-microtome. Slides were conserved at -80 °C until use. RNA probes were designed to have a maximum identity with aspecific targets of 80% over a 100-bp window. Primers to amplify the probe for Olfr171 were: AGTGCCTTCTCTTGGCAGT (forward) and GAGTGTGGGTGT-CAGGATGG (reverse). The probe was transcribed with fluorescein-labeled UTP using the Roche RNA Labeling Kit and In-Vitro Transcription Kit (Roche, ref. 11175025910) following the manufacturer's protocol. Slides were post-fixed in 10% formalin for 15 min, and washed for 3 min in PBS. Slides were incubated in 0.1% H 2 O 2 for 30 min and then washed twice in PBS for 3 min. Slides were then treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K in TE for 5 min, followed by an incubation in 10% formalin for 10 min and washed in PBS for 3 min. 0.2 M HCl was then added to the slides for 10 min, followed by a 3 min PBS wash. Then the slides were preincubated in 0.1 M triethanolamine HCl, pH 8 for 1 min and incubated in 0.1 M triethanolamine HCl with acetic anhydride for 10 min, followed by a 3 min PBS wash. Probes were denatured for 7 min at 70 °C and diluted 1:400 in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 μg/μl tRNA and 1× Denhardt's solution in nuclease-free water. Slides were incubated in the hybridization buffer for 14-18 h at 65 °C. Slides were washed 2 × 30 min at 65 °C and 1 × 30 min at 20-25 °C in 1× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% Tween-20, H2O DEPC. They were then pre-incubated 30 min with 1× MABT with 2% Blocking Reagent (Roche, ref. 001,11,096,176). Roche Anti-Fluorescein POD Fab fragments (Roche, ref. 11426346910) was diluted 1:200 in pre-incubation mix and slides were covered with the antibody solution for 30 min. Slides were washed 3 × 5 min in TNT (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris, HCl to pH 7.5 in 10 L, 0.05% Tween-20), treated with PerkinElmer Biotinylated Tyramide 1:50 in Amplification Diluent for 30 min, and washed 3 × 5 min in TNT. Finally they were treated with Alexa-488-labeled Streptavidin (Life Technologies) 1:100 in PerkinElmer Amplification Diluent for 30 min, washed 3 × 5 min in TNT and then incubated with PBS. Fluorescence intensity was assessed by measuring the total fluorescence of a disk with an area of 1.8 μm 2 in diameter that comprised the transcription foci using the ImageJ software. Fluorescence intensity ratios were calculated by dividing the fluorescence level of each exposed neuron to the mean fluorescence of control neurons that had been processed in parallel. RNAscope in situ hybridization. 5-weeks-old male and female Olfr16 GFP/GFP mice were exposed to odorants for 5 h (n = 3 mice exposed to 5% lyral in DMSO, n = 3 mice exposed to 5% acetophenone in DMSO and n = 6 mice exposed to DMSO only). Exposure to the two odorants took place on different days, each time with a control group. Lyral is a known ligand for Olfr16, while acetophenone is known not to activate this receptor 25 . Mice were euthanized and heads were fixed in freshly prepared 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. Tissue was sequentially immersed in 10% sucrose for 18 h, 20% sucrose for 8 h and 30% sucrose for 8 h, always at 4 °C. Heads were embedded on OCT, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until sectioning. The main olfactory epithelium was cut on a cryostat microtome in 16 μm coronal sections. For each mouse, 2 sections were used for RNAscope ISH. Endogenous GFP signal was used to select section with a high number of OSNs expressing Olfr16. Slides were imaged with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope equipped with 405, 555, and 639 nm laserlines, using a 40 × 1.3 NA oil-immersion objective. Cells of interest were identified based on the expression of Olfr16. Images of 5 Z stacks were acquired and exported as orthogonal projections for analysis. Images were analyzed using the CellProfiler software, version 4.2.1 77 . with the Speckle Counting pipeline. As the cell-density within the main olfactory epithelium does not allow for automated cell segmentation, the contour of Olfr16-positive cells was manually drawn based on the Olfr16-labeling and DAPI staining (IdentifyObjectsManually). Then, the number of Mustn1-positive puncta were counted automatically within this ROI. The same settings for probe detection were used for all images pertaining to the same experiment, including both exposed and control mice. As Olfr16 is a highly expressed gene (always > 15 puncta/cell) the number of fluorescent spots per cell can not be quantified 78 , we recorded the total number of labeled pixels and the total intensity of pixels within each Olfr16-positive cell. These are arbitrary units and do not reflect absolute transcription values, but allow us to estimate changes in transcription between control and exposed mice. Statistics and reproducibility. Statistical tests and data representation were computed in R version 4. Data points were represented in the graphs when the number of dots was <10, otherwise the distribution of dots were represented in violin plots. All statistical tests were performed considering a two-sided alternative hypothesis. Continuity correction was applied to Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Significance was assessed for p values < 0.05. Detail of all statistical tests are shown in Supplementary Table 1 . For transcriptional quantification by RNAscope, the experiment was performed once for each odor and included non-exposed mice in both experiments. Each experiment included several independent biological samples from each condition. For transcriptional quantification by standard in situ hybridization, the experiments was repeated four times and included both control and exposed samples in each experiment.

Certain lower vertebrates like zebrafish activate proliferation of spared cardiomyocytes after cardiac injury to regenerate lost heart muscle. Here, we used translating ribosome affinity purification to profile translating RNAs in zebrafish cardiomyocytes during heart regeneration. We identified dynamic induction of several Jak1/Stat3 pathway members following trauma, events accompanied by cytokine production. Transgenic Stat3 inhibition in cardiomyocytes restricted injury-induced proliferation and regeneration, but did not reduce cardiogenesis during animal growth. The secreted protein Rln3a was induced in a Stat3-dependent manner by injury, and exogenous Rln3 delivery during Stat3 inhibition stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation. Our results identify an injuryspecific cardiomyocyte program essential for heart regeneration. TRAP | cardiac regeneration | interleukin | inflammation | endocardium C ardiac regeneration eludes adult mammals, but certain nonmammalian vertebrates present models of robust cardiac repair. In particular, zebrafish maintain a high capacity for myocardial regeneration throughout life and can create new heart muscle with minimal scarring after a variety of severe genetic or mechanical injuries (1) (2) (3) . Thus, studies of how heart regeneration occurs naturally can help guide approaches to stimulating adult mammalian heart regeneration, for which there are now multiple promising strategies (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Genetic fate-mapping experiments indicated that spared cardiomyocytes are the primary source tissue for zebrafish heart regeneration, with little or no contribution by a resident stem cell population (1, (10) (11) (12) . Retinoic acid, Transforming growth factor beta 1, Insulin-like growth factor 2, Sonic hedgehog, and Plateletderived growth factor ligands all are synthesized in the vicinity of proliferating cardiomyocytes, and have positive influences on muscle regeneration (13) (14) (15) (16) . Other potential factors include hypoxia, which appears to play a positive role in cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas hyperoxia, active p38α mitogen activated protein kinase, and microRNA miR-133 have negative roles (17) (18) (19) . Defining additional pathways that underlie injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation in zebrafish is important for better understanding heart regeneration, and is also relevant to new methodology to boost the low levels of cardiomyocyte proliferation in injured mammalian hearts (20, 21) . Novel transgenic profiling technologies have recently been developed for isolation of actively translated mRNAs from specific cell types (22, 23) . For example, with translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technology, an enhanced GFP (EGFP) reporter gene is fused to the N terminus of the large subunit ribosomal protein L10a, and this cassette is placed downstream of a tissue-specific promoter. Translating mRNAs can then be isolated from promoter-defined cell populations in transgenic animals by immunoprecipitation with an antibody recognizing EGFP. Although this technology has not yet been applied to tissue regeneration, TRAP avoids tissue dissociation and cell purification, and thus has clear advantages for profiling injury and regeneration responses in specific cell types. Here, we used TRAP to identify ribosome-associated RNAs in zebrafish cardiomyocytes during heart regeneration. Results To generate cardiomyocyte ribosome-associated RNA profiles from transgenic zebrafish, we used regulatory sequences of cardiac myosin light chain 2a to drive expression of an EGFP-L10a cassette [Tg(cmlc2:EGFP-RPL10a) pd61 ] (referred to as cmlc2:TRAP) (Fig. 1 A and B ). Because the cmlc2a promoter is active in virtually all adult cardiomyocytes, the cmlc2:TRAP line is expected to identify cardiomyocyte gene expression during early injury responses as well as regenerative responses. The TRAP reporter was expressed in cardiomyocytes, where its presence did not inhibit heart regeneration (Fig. 1C ). To assess the specificity of this approach, we immunoprecipitated ribosomeassociated RNAs from ventricles of adult cmlc2:TRAP fish and examined expression of cardiac genes. These experiments detected known cardiomyocyte markers by PCR amplification, but genes with expression known to be restricted to other cell types were weak or undetectable (Fig. 1D ). To profile gene expression after injury, we immunoprecipitated cardiomyocyte RNAs from uninjured cmlc2:TRAP fish ventricles and ventricles at 1 and 7 d after 20% apical resection (dpa). The apical halves of ventricles were collected and pooled, and immunoprecipitated RNA was processed for microarray analysis. We identified 138 genes with significant expression differences at 1 dpa compared with uninjured ventricles, and fewer differentially expressed genes at 7 dpa (Fig. S1A and Table S1 ; raw data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus Web site). Levels of ion transporters and channels, such as solute carrier family 39 member 3, chloride intracellular channel 5, solute carrier family 12, and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 6, were increased by 1 dpa, supporting previously identified changes in cardiomyocyte electrical properties during regeneration (1, 11) . We also found increased levels of genes relevant to cell survival and proliferation, such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2), jun B proto-oncogene a, FOS-like antigen 1a, poly(ADPribose) polymerase family member 3 and 4 (Fig. S1B ). Compared with a published microarray dataset using whole 1-dpa ventricular tissue (24) , only 10 genes with significant expression changes are shared. Possible explanations for this modest overlap include: (i) background noise from gene-expression changes in nonmuscle cells; (ii) specificity of the TRAP technique to ribosome-associated RNAs; and (iii) variation in gene coverage among microarrays. TRAP did not identify some genes previously detected by visual techniques in cardiomyocytes at 7 dpa, such as gata4 and mps1 (3, 11) . We suspect that this finding is at least in part a result of dilution of signals by cardiomyocytes that are not participating in regeneration at this stage. Most remarkably, several members of the Janus kinase 1/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Jak1/Stat3) pathway represented on the microarray, including interleukin 6 signal transducer (il6st), jak1, stat3, and the target gene suppressor of cytokine signaling 3b (socs3b), had highly elevated levels in 1-dpa cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1E ), results confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig. 1F ). Among seven Stat factors (Stat1-4, -5a, -5b, and -6), Stat3 is activated by a variety of cytokines/growth factors and has multiple functions in embryogenesis and cell survival/proliferation (25, 26) . The Jak1/Stat3 pathway was the top enriched pathway at 1 dpa as analyzed by the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool (P value: 1.4 E-4), but did not emerge as a significantly enriched pathway in previous transcriptome analyses of zebrafish heart regeneration that used whole-tissue samples (24, 27) . jak2a and stat2, which is expected to provide a more restricted immunoregulatory function, were recently reported by microarray or qPCR as up-regulated in 7-dpa whole-cardiac tissue (18) . However, stat2 and other stat genes did not show significant myocardial up-regulation in our experiments. To confirm that these profiles could represent increased translation products, we assessed protein levels in whole cardiac tissue by Western blotting. We detected increased levels of Stat3, phosphorylated Stat3, and Bcl2 protein at 1 dpa, consistent with rapid induction in cardiomyocytes after injury (Fig. 1G ). Jak1/Stat3 signaling is initiated by dimerization of the signal transducer Il6st upon cytokine binding to its receptor. Following Il6st dimerization, Jak is activated and phosphorylates Il6st, creating a docking site for Stat3. After phosphorylation, Stat3 dimers dissociate from the receptor, translocate to the nucleus, and activate transcription of genes involved in cell survival, cell proliferation, and other events (28, 29) . Pathway up-regulation was further confirmed by in situ hybridization. Similar to dynamic expression signatures of certain epicardial and endocardial factors (15, 30) , induction of Jak1/Stat3 pathway genes was first organ-wide at 1 dpa, but then localized to a region of cardiomyocytes at the site of regeneration by 7 dpa (Fig. 2 A and B, and Fig. S2A ). Many ligands transduce signaling via Jak1/Stat3. Based on identification of il6st up-regulation after injury, we examined expression of cytokine receptors that are known to mediate Il6st dimerization (31) . We did not detect expression of the oncostatin M receptor osmr from cmlc2:TRAP samples (Fig. S2B ). Of interleukin 6 receptor alpha (il6r-α), interleukin 11 receptor alpha (il11r-α), and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha a (lifra), we found that il11r-α was most abundantly expressed in uninjured cardiomyocytes, and its levels increased by 1 d following injury. lifra was the next most abundantly expressed receptor, although we could not detect increased levels after injury (Fig. S2B ). Correspondingly, we detected increased levels of il11r-α ligands interleukin 11 a and b (il11a, il11b) and the lifra ligand lif from whole ventricular tissue at 1 dpa, but no increases in other potential ligands like ciliary neurotrophic factor (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2  C-E ). Among these genes, il11a was the most abundant ligand at 1 dpa (Fig. S2E ). By in situ hybridization, we detected induction of il11a throughout the ventricle in endocardial cells at 1 dpa (Fig. 2D ), localization that was supported by histological colocalization with fli1:EGFP and by RT-PCR analysis of purified fli1: EGFP + endothelial/endocardial cells (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2F ). By 7 dpa, il11a reactivity was detected only at the injury site in endocardial cells, as well as other cell types (Fig. 2D ). We did not detect the expression of il11b or lif by in situ hybridization, and by contrast with il11a, their expression was detectable at 1 dpa by RT-PCR in cells enriched for the myeloid marker pu.1 (Fig. 2E ). We also detected weak expression of il11b in endothelial/ endocardial cells, whereas lif was exclusively detected in pu.1enriched cells (Fig. 2E ). Thus, our data indicate that cardiac injury triggers rapid induction of Jak1/Stat3 pathway members in cardiomyocytes that is coordinated with ligand production from auxiliary cells. This program activates first in an organwide manner, then localizes to the injury site. and anf (also known as natriuretic peptide precursor A) are expressed in cardiomyocytes (CMs), and flk1 (endocardial), gata2a (hematopoietic), and tcf21 (epicardial) are noncardiomyocyte genes (Non-CMs).

(F) qPCR using RNAs immunoprecipitated from cmlc2:TRAP ventricles, confirming up-regulation of Jak1/Stat3 pathway members after injury. Expression levels were normalized to that of β-actin2, and further normalized to that of the uninjured sample. Data are mean ± SEM n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student t test (unpaired, two-tailed). (G) Western Blots using total proteins extracted from uninjured and 1-dpa hearts, indicating increased protein levels of Stat3, phosphorylated Stat3 (P-Stat3), and Bcl2 at 1 dpa. Tubulin was used as a loading control (shown for Stat3 and P-Stat3 lanes). To define requirements for the Jak1/Stat3 pathway during heart regeneration, we created a transgenic line that enabled inducible expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 cassette [Tg(bactin2:loxp-DsRED-STOP-loxp-dnStat3-GFP) pd59 ] (referred to as β-act2:RSdS) (Fig. 3A ). This cassette is based on published studies showing that mutation of a tyrosine blocks phosphorylation and dimerization, functioning as a dominant-negative to specifically inhibit Stat3 signaling (32, 33) . To express dnStat3 specifically in cardiomyocytes, we crossed this line to a second transgenic line permitting 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)-inducible Cre-mediated recombination in cardiomyocytes [Tg(cmlc2: CreER) pd13 ], and incubated animals with 4-HT. Following 4-HT introduction and ventricular injury, there was an ∼80% reduction in expression of the target gene socs3b from whole ventricular tissue at 1 dpa, indicating reduced Stat3 activity (Fig. S3A ). To examine the effects of dnStat3 on regeneration, we treated cmlc2:CreER;β-act2:RSdS and control β-act2:RSdS fish with 4-HT, injured their ventricles 3 d later, and allowed animals to regenerate for 30 d. Although the ventricular walls of control animals regenerated with little or no scarring, animals with induced dnStat3 displayed prominent cardiac muscle deficiencies and scarring (Fig. 3B ). To assess how Stat3 inhibition blocks regeneration, we examined cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury. We observed ∼80% and ∼36% reductions in proliferation indices at 7 and 14 dpa, respectively, in 4-HTtreated fish expressing dnStat3 (Fig. 3 C and D, and Fig. S3 B and C), indicating a sustained requirement in normal cardiomyocyte proliferation. We also examined whether Stat3 activity was required for cardiomyocyte proliferation that is stimulated by low population density in juvenile and young adult animals, conditions that enable rapid animal and cardiac growth. Low density-stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation levels are typically comparable with levels of resection-induced proliferation (34) . In contrast with effects on regenerative proliferation, dnStat3 induction did not reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation indices during 10 d under accelerated growth conditions, and animals grew normally (Fig. 3D and Fig. S4 A-C ). We also found that zebrafish larvae survive to adulthood after myocardial induction of dnStat3 at 4 d postfertilization (Fig. S4D ). Taken together, these results indicate that Stat3 requirements during cardiomyocyte proliferation are preferential or unique to the context of injury. To determine how Stat3 levels might control cardiomyocyte proliferation, we performed a second round of unbiased screening: microarray analysis using total RNA samples collected from cmlc2:CreER;β-act2:RSdS and control ventricles at 1 and 7 dpa. We then analyzed these microarray data together with TRAP microarray data. We searched for genes encoding factors with increased expression after injury represented on both microarray datasets, and with reduced expression during Stat3 inhibition. Relaxin 3a (Rln3a), a member of the Relaxin family of secreted peptide hormones first studied in reproductive tissues but also with reported roles in other tissues, met these criteria. Relaxin ligands interact with Relaxin/Insulin-like family peptide receptors, G protein-coupled receptors that transduce signals via a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathway (35, 36) . In our experiments, rln3a was up-regulated 36.2-fold in cardiomyocytes by 1 dpa (Fig. 4A ), and its expression was reduced 90% by myocardial Stat3 inhibition (Fig. 4B ). Analysis of rln3a upstream sequences identified multiple predicted Stat binding sites (Fig. S5 ). Moreover, ChIP experiments with an antibody against Stat3 showed enrichment of rln3a upstream sequences in samples from 1-dpa ventricles (Fig. 4 C and D), providing additional evidence of endogenous regulation by Stat3. To test if diminished Rln3a production contributed to the dnStat3-based regenerative deficits, we treated cmlc2:CreER; lif was detected in pu.1-enriched samples; it was undetectable when the same amount of total ventricular RNA was used for amplification (total). il11b was detected in pu.1-enriched samples and less so in fli1:EGFP + samples. anf and tcf21 are markers for cardiomyocytes and epicardium, respectively, and were detected in total ventricular RNA samples. (Scale bars, 50 μm.) β-act2:RSdS zebrafish with 4-HT, injured their ventricles, and retro-orbitally introduced recombinant human Rln3 daily over a 1-wk period. Notably, a daily 100 ng Rln3 protocol increased the cardiomyocyte proliferation index by ∼61% at 7 dpa, accounting for ∼33% of the effects of Stat3 inhibition (Fig. 4 E and F ). Rln3 delivery to wild-type fish did not increase 7-dpa cardiomyocyte proliferation, and a single 100-ng treatment at 6 dpa was insufficient to increase cardiomyocyte proliferation (Fig. 4E ). These results indicate that the effects of myocardial Jak1/Stat3 signaling on heart regeneration are mediated at least in part by cardiac production and mitogenic activity of Rln3a. Discussion In summary, we have described a new transgenic line that enables the profiling of translated RNAs in zebrafish cardiomyocytes. This reagent, and similar transgenic lines representing other cardiac cells, like endocardium and epicardium, should prove a sensitive means to identify new wild-type and mutant/transgenic expression features during cardiac morphogenesis and regeneration. Our profiling during heart regeneration pointed to early myocardial activation of Jak1/Stat3 downstream mediators by tissue damage, events that occur concomitantly with cytokine production in endocardial and inflammatory cells. After an initial organ-wide response, these components are coordinately enhanced at the injury site, where their activities stimulate Rln3a production and are required for cardiomyocyte proliferation. Notably, evidence from previous studies indicates that Stat3 and Il11 are cytoprotective for murine cardiomyocytes after ischemic injury. Il11 expression is increased in mouse hearts after myocardial infarction, and intravenous delivery of Il11 protected cardiomyocytes from apoptosis and reduced infarct size through a mechanism that requires Stat3 in cardiomyocytes. Similarly, mice with Stat3-deficient cardiomyocytes are susceptible to both age-related and injury-induced heart failure (37-39). These findings together with the current study indicate that Jak1/ Stat3 signaling is activated by cardiac injury in multiple vertebrate species, but with different outcomes of cardiac regeneration (zebrafish) or nonhyperplastic remodeling (mice). It will be interesting to identify factors that interact with Jak1/Stat3 signaling and influence these outcomes. In our study, an unbiased approach found Rln3a as a direct target of Stat3 during zebrafish heart regeneration. Relaxin has been described to have antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, or angiogenic effects in multiple tissues, including the heart (40) . To our knowledge, whether Stat3 mediates some of its functions through Relaxin in mammals has not been explored. Jak/Stat signaling was recently shown to stimulate selfrenewal and differentiation of Drosophila intestinal stem cells in response to cytokine production from stressed or dying cells (41) . In this tissue, Jak/Stat signaling is titrated and localized to stimulate cell replacement as necessary. Jak/Stat signaling is also critical for murine liver and intestinal epithelial regeneration, and in regenerative neural tissues of zebrafish, such as retina and hair cells (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) . It is also interesting to note that recent studies have indicated proregenerative roles of inflammatory cytokines in tissues like zebrafish brain, axolotl limb, and adult mouse skeletal muscle (47) (48) (49) . Thus, cytokine release and Jak/Stat signaling appear to represent general mechanisms for how injury induces and maintains local tissue regeneration in multiple contexts and species. Methods Zebrafish and Injuries. Outbred wild-type or transgenic zebrafish of the Ekkwill strain were used for ventricular resection surgeries, as described previously (3) . All transgenic strains were analyzed as hemizygotes. To induce dnStat3-GFP expression in cardiomyocytes, cmlc2:CreER;β-act2:RSdS fish were incubated with 5 μM 4-HT for 24 h. Three days later, ventricular resections were performed. Animal growth conditions were implemented as described previously (34) , with 4-HT administered 3 d before placement at different densities. Recombinant human Rln3 peptide (ProSci) was dissolved in 0.9 × PBS and retro-orbitally injected once daily for 7 d after heart surgery, or once at 6 dpa (50) . Experiments with zebrafish were performed in accordance with animal use guidelines at Duke University. Generation of Transgenic Zebrafish. To generate Tg(cmlc2:EGFP-RPL10a) pd61 , the zebrafish ribosomal protein L10a (RPL10a) (NM_199636) was amplified using the primers 5′-TCCGGCCGGACTCAGATCTCGAGCTCAAGCTTCGAAT-TCAGCAAGGTCTCGAGG ACACGTTG -3′ and 5′-AAGTGCGGCCGCCTAGT-AGAGGCGCTGTGGTTTTCCCATGGTGCT -3′, and EGFP was amplified using the primers 5′-ACAGGATCCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTG -3′ and 5′GAATTCGAAGCTTGAGCTCGAGATCTGAGTCCGGCCGGACTTGTACAG-CTCGTCCATGCCGAG -3′. The resulting PCR products were used to amplify the final EGFP-RPL10a fusion cassette using the primers 5′-ACAGGATCCG-CCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTG -3′ and 5′-AAGTGCGGCCGCCT-AGTAGAGGCGCTGTGGTTTTCCCATGGTGCT -3′. The TRAP cassette was then subcloned downstream of the ∼5-kb regulatory sequence of cmlc2. To make the Tg(bactin2:loxp-DsRED-STOP-loxp-dnStat3-GFP) pd59 line, the zebrafish Stat3 dominant-negative mutant was created as described previously (33) . Briefly, the zebrafish stat3 cDNA was isolated by PCR using primers: 5′-ATGGCCCAGTGGAATCAGTTGC -3′ and 5′-CTAAGCATTTCGG-CAGGTGTCCATA -3′. A tyrosine to phenylalanine change was introduced via PCR-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis using the primers 5′-ATGTGTA-ACTCAACCCTTCCTGAAGACCAAGTT -3′ and 5′-AACTTGGTCTTCAGGAAGG-GTTGAGTTACACAT -3′. The C terminus was fused with a 9-aa spacer followed by hrGFPII. The resultant cassette was subcloned into the previously described β-actin2:loxp-DsRED-STOP-loxp-EGFP construct (11) with Age1/NotI to replace EGFP. Plasmids were injected together with IsceI into one cell-stage embryos and founders were screened by examining fluorescence in embryos. Tg(cmlc2:CreER) pd13 is an independent founder line similar to lines described previously (11, 51) . This line displays more efficient, but also occasionally leaky, recombination compared with other published cmlc2:CreER lines. See Table S2 for primers for PCR and qPCR. Histological Methods. All histology was performed with 10-μm cryosections. In situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes, Acid Fuchsin-Orange G staining, and immunofluoresence staining with PCNA/Mef2 antibodies were performed, imaged, and quantified as described previously (15) . Confocal images were obtained using a LSM 700 microscope (Zeiss). Primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-EGFP (rabbit; Invitrogen), anti-Myosin heavy chain (MHC; F59, mouse; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and anti-PCNA (mouse; Sigma). Alexa fluor 488-, 633-, or 594-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. RNA Purification by TRAP, and Microarrays. Fifty apical halves of ventricles from cmlc2:TRAP zebrafish were collected, homogenized, and subjected to polysome purification, as described previously (23) . RNAs were purified with Picopure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus), and cDNAs were synthesized and amplified using the Nugen Pico WTA system (Nugen). Microarrays were performed using the zebrafish 12 × 135 Nimblegem chip at Mogene, and analyzed using the R/Bioconductor oligo and limma packages (52, 53) . Genes with a false-discovery rate-adjusted P value < 0.10 were considered to be differentially expressed. For each time point, three independent microarray experiments were undertaken. Annotation was confirmed by mapping probe sequences provided by the manufacturer to the Zv9 version of the zebrafish genome. For microarray analysis of uninjured and injured ventricles from control and cmlc2:CreER;β-act2:RSdS animals, four to six apical halves of ventricles was collected for each total RNA sample (also performed in triplicate). Genes with P value < 0.05 (Student t test) and fold-changes ≥ 2 were considered as differentially expressed. See Supporting Information for additional methods. Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1.

Introduction Eukaryotic genomes are hierarchically packaged into chromatin 1 , and the nature of this packaging plays a central role in gene regulation 2, 3 . Major insights into the epigenetic information encoded within the nucleoprotein structure of chromatin have come from highthroughput, genome-wide methods for separately assaying the chromatin accessibility ("open chromatin") 4, 5 , nucleosome positioning [6] [7] [8] , and transcription factor (TF) occupancy 9 . While powerful, published protocols for existing methods require millions of cells as starting material, complex and time-consuming sample preparations, and cannot simultaneously probe the interplay of nucleosome positioning, chromatin accessibility, and TF binding. These limitations are problematic in three major ways: First, current methods can average over and "drown out" heterogeneity in cellular populations. Second, cells must often be grown ex vivo to obtain sufficient biomaterials, perturbing the in vivo context and modulating the epigenetic state in unknown ways. Third, input requirements often prevent application of these assays to well-defined clinical samples, precluding generation of "personal epigenomes" in diagnostic timescales. Here we report a robust and sensitive method for epigenomic profiling that can provide a multi-dimensional portrait of gene regulation. We use ATAC-seq to identify regions of open chromatin, identify nucleosome-bound and nucleosome-free positions in regulatory regions, and infer the positions of DNA binding proteins using "footprinting" in a B-cell line. Finally we demonstrate that this method is compatible with clinical timescales and standard blood draws by observing the open chromatin landscape of a healthy volunteer. Results ATAC-seq probes chromatin accessibility with transposons Hyperactive Tn5 transposase 10, 11 , loaded in vitro with adapters for high-throughput DNA sequencing, can simultaneously fragment and tag a genome with sequencing adapters (previously described as "tagmentation" 11 ). Because transposons have been shown to integrate into active regulatory elements in vivo 12 , we hypothesized that transposition by purified Tn5, a prokaryotic transposase, on small numbers of unfixed eukaryotic nuclei would interrogate regions of accessible chromatin. Here we describe Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin followed by high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq). ATAC-seq uses Tn5 transposase to integrate its adapter payload into regions of accessible chromatin, whereas steric hindrance less accessible chromatin makes transposition less probable. Therefore, amplifiable DNA fragments suitable for high-throughput sequencing are preferentially generated at locations of open chromatin (Fig 1a ). The entire assay and library construction can be carried out in a simple two-step process involving Tn5 insertion and PCR. In contrast, published DNase-and FAIRE-seq protocols for assaying chromatin accessibility involve multi-step protocols and many potentially loss-prone steps, such as adapter ligation, gel purification, and crosslink reversal. For instance, a published DNaseseq protocol calls for approximately 44 steps, and two overnight incubations, while published FAIRE-seq protocols require two overnight incubations carried out over at least 3 days 13, 14 . Furthermore, these protocols require 1-50 million cells (FAIRE) or 50 million cells (DNase-seq) 13, 14 , perhaps because of these complex workflows (Fig 1b ). In comparison to established methods, ATAC-seq enables rapid and efficient library generation because assay and library preparation are carried out in a single enzymatic step. Extensive analyses show that ATAC-seq provides accurate and sensitive measure of chromatin accessibility genome-wide. We carried out ATAC-seq on 50,000 and 500 unfixed nuclei isolated from GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line (ENCODE Tier 1 15 ) for comparison and validation with chromatin accessibility data sets, including DNase-seq 13 and FAIREseq 16 . At a locus previously highlighted by others 5 , (Fig. 1c ), ATAC-seq has a signal-tonoise ratio similar to DNase-seq, which was generated from approximately 3 to 5 orders-ofmagnitude more cells 13, 14 . Peak intensities were highly reproducible between technical replicates (R=0.98), and highly correlated between ATAC-seq and DNase-seq (R=0.79 and R=0.83, Supplementary Fig. 1 ), and we note that the majority of reads within peaks come from intersections of DNase and ATAC-seq peaks (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Comparing our data to DHSs identified in ENCODE DNase-seq data, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrate a similar sensitivity and specificity as DNase-seq (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). We also note that ATAC-seq peak intensities correlate well with markers of active chromatin and not with transposase sequence preference (Supplementary Fig. 4 and 5 ). Highly sensitive open chromatin detection is maintained even when using 5,000 or 500 human nuclei as starting material (Supplementary Fig. 3 and 6 ), although sensitivity is diminished for smaller numbers of input material, as can be seen in Fig 1c . ATAC-seq insert sizes disclose nucleosome positions We found that ATAC-seq paired-end reads produce detailed information about nucleosome packing and positioning. The insert size distribution of sequenced fragments from human chromatin has clear periodicity of approximately 200 base pairs, suggesting many fragments are protected by integer multiples of nucleosomes (Fig 2a ). This fragment size distribution also shows clear periodicity equal to the helical pitch of DNA 11 . By partitioning insert size distribution according to functional classes of chromatin as defined by previous models 17 , and normalizing to the global insert distribution (see Methods) we observe clear classspecific enrichments across this insert size distribution (Fig. 2b ), demonstrating that these functional states of chromatin have an accessibility "fingerprint" that can be read out with ATAC-seq. These differential fragmentation patterns are consistent with the putative functional state of these classes, as CTCF-bound regions are enriched for short fragments of DNA, while transcription start sites are differentially depleted for mono-, di-and trinucleosome associated fragments. Transcribed and promoter flanking regions are enriched for longer multi-nucleosomal fragments, suggesting they may represent more compacted forms of chromatin. Finally, prior studies have shown that certain DNA sequences are refractory to nuclease digestion and released as large, multi-nucleosome-sized fragments 18 ; subsequent studies showed that such fragments are condensed heterochromatin 19 . Indeed we found repressed regions are depleted for short fragments and enriched for phased multinucleosomal inserts, consistent with their expected inaccessible state. These data suggest that ATAC-seq reveals differentially accessible forms of chromatin, which have been long hypothesized to exist in vivo 2, 20, 21 . To explore nucleosome positioning within accessible chromatin in the GM12878 cell line, we partitioned our data into reads generated from putative nucleosome free regions of DNA, and reads likely derived from nucleosome associated DNA (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Using a simple heuristic that positively weights nucleosome associated fragments and negatively weights nucleosome free fragments (see Methods), we calculated a data track used to call nucleosome positions within regions of accessible chromatin 22 . An example locus (Fig. 3a ) contains a putative bidirectional promoter with CAGE data showing two transcription start sites (TSS) separated by ~700bps. ATAC-seq reveals in fact two distinct nucleosome free regions, separated by a single well-positioned mononucleosome (Fig. 3a ). Compared to MNase-seq 23 , ATAC-seq data is more amenable to detecting nucleosomes within putative regulatory regions, as the majority of reads are concentrated within accessible regions of chromatin (Fig. 3b ). By averaging signal across all active TSSs, we note nucleosome-free fragments are enriched at a canonical nucleosome-free promoter region overlapping the TSS, while our nucleosome signal is enriched both upstream and downstream of the active TSS, and displays characteristic phasing of upstream and downstream nucleosomes 6, 7 (Fig. 3c ). Because ATAC-seq reads are concentrated at regions of open chromatin, we see strong nucleosome signal at the +1 nucleosome, which decreases at the +2, +3 and +4 nucleosomes, in contrast, MNase-seq nucleosome signal increases at larger distances from the TSS likely due to over digestion of more accessible nucleosomes. Additionally, MNase-seq (4 billion reads) assays all nucleosomes, whereas reads generated from ATAC-seq (198 million paired reads) are concentrated at regulatory nucleosomes (Fig. 3b, c ). Using our nucleosome calls, we further partitioned putative distal regulatory regions and TSSs into regions that were nucleosome free and regions that were predicted to be nucleosome bound. We note that TSSs were enriched for nucleosome free regions when compared to distal elements, which tend to remain nucleosome rich (Fig. 3d ). These data suggest ATAC-seq can provide high-resolution readout of nucleosome associated and nucleosome free regions in regulatory elements genome wide. ATAC-seq reveals patterns of nucleosome-TF spacing ATAC-seq high-resolution regulatory nucleosome maps can be used to understand the relationship between nucleosomes and DNA binding factors. Using ChIP-seq data, we plotted the position of a variety of DNA binding factors with respect to the dyad of the nearest nucleosome. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Figure 3e ) revealed major classes of binding with respect to the proximal nucleosome, including 1) a strongly nucleosome avoiding group of factors with binding events stereotyped at ~180 bases from the nearest nucleosome dyad (comprising C-FOS, NFYA and IRF3), 2) a class of factors that "nestle up" precisely to the expected end of nucleosome DNA contacts, which notably includes chromatin looping factors CTCF and cohesion complex subunits RAD21 and SMC3; 3) a large class of primarily TFs that have gradations of nucleosome avoiding or nucleosomeoverlapping binding behavior, and 4) a class whose binding sites tend to overlap nucleosome-associated DNA. Interestingly, this final class includes chromatin remodeling factors such as CHD1 and SIN3A as well as RNA polymerase II, which appears to be enriched at the nucleosome boundary 8 . The interplay between precise nucleosome positioning and locations of DNA binding factor immediately suggests specific hypotheses for mechanistic studies, a potential advantage of ATAC-seq. ATAC-seq footprints infer factor occupancy genome-wide ATAC-seq enables accurate inference of DNA binding factor occupancy genome-wide. We reasoned that DNA sequences directly occupied by DNA-binding proteins are protected from transposition; the resulting sequence "footprint" reveals the presence of the DNAbinding protein at each site, analogous to DNase digestion footprints 24 . At a specific CTCF binding site on chromosome 1, we observed a clear footprint (a deep notch of ATAC-seq signal), similar to footprints seen by DNase-seq 25, 26 , at the precise location of the CTCF motif that coincides with the summit of the CTCF ChIP-seq signal in GM12878 cells (Fig 4a ). We averaged ATAC-seq signal over all expected locations of CTCF within the genome and observed a well-stereotyped "footprint" (Fig. 4b ). Similar results were obtained for a variety of common TFs (for examples see Supplementary Fig. 8 ). We inferred the CTCF binding probability from motif consensus score, evolutionary conservation, and ATAC-seq insertion data to generate a posterior probability of CTCF binding at all loci (Fig. 4c ) 27 . Results using ATAC-seq closely recapitulate ChIP-seq binding data in this cell line and compare favorably to DNase-based factor occupancy inference (see Supplementary Fig. 9 ), suggesting that factor occupancy data can be extracted from these ATAC-seq data allowing reconstruction of regulatory networks. ATAC-seq enables epigenomic analysis on clinical timescales Because ATAC-seq is rapid, information rich, and compatible with small numbers of cells, we reasoned it may serve as a powerful tool for personalized epigenomics in the clinic. Specifically, we envision "personal epigenomics" as genome-scale information about chromatin generated from an individual from a standard clinical sample in a clinical timescale. We applied ATAC-seq to assay the personal T-cell epigenome of a healthy volunteer via standard serial blood draws, to demonstrate a workflow capable of generating ATAC-seq libraries in clinical timescales. Using rapid T-cell enrichment and sample handling protocols (see Methods), the total required time from blood draw to sequencing was approximately 275 minutes (Fig. 5a ). When coupled with ongoing improvements to sequencing and analysis turn-around times, we envision ATAC-seq will offer the possibility of a daily turn-around time for a personal epigenomic map. To explore this possibility, we performed ATAC-seq on three consecutive days via standard blood draws from a single individual (Fig. 5b ). As an exercise to consider how personal epigenomic maps may contain personalized regulatory information, we investigated ATAC-seq profile at the IL2 locus. IL-2 is a key cytokine that drives T-cell growth and functions in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 28 . Furthermore, distinct drugs [29] [30] [31] inhibit the activities of different transcription factors that bind putative IL2 enhancers in a context-dependent manner. In principle, one might wish to identify the causal transcription factor pathway in order to rationally target inhibition without exposing the patient to drugs unlikely to serve the therapeutic goal of IL-2 blockade. ATAC-seq shows that in the proband's T-cells, only NFAT, but not two other drug targets, is engaging IL2 (Fig. 5c ), providing clinically relevant information on the regulatory state of this individual. Using ATAC-seq footprints we generated the occupancy profiles of 89 transcription factors in proband T-cells, enabling systematic reconstruction of regulatory networks. With this personalized regulatory map, we compared the genomic distribution of the same 89 transcription factors between GM12878 and proband CD4+ T-cells. Transcription factors that exhibit large variation in distribution between T-cells and B-cells are enriched for T-cell specific factors (Fig. 5d ). This analysis shows NFAT is differentially regulating, while canonical CTCF occupancy is highly correlated within these two cell types (Fig. 5d ). Supporting this interpretation, we note specific loci where NFAT is localized nearby to known T-cell specific genes such as CD28 and a novel lincRNA RP11-229C3.2 (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Additionally, ATAC-seq of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, and monocytes isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from a single blood draw created an interpretative framework for the personal epigenomes, and demonstrated that ATAC-seq is compatible with cellular enrichment using surface markers (Supplementary Fig. 11 ). Separately, allele-specific chromatin accessibility has been shown to be particularly relevant to our understanding of human disease 32 . As a proof of principle we also used ATAC-seq to identify candidate allele-specific open chromatin regions within the GM12878 cell line (Supplementary Fig. 12 ). These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating detailed personalized gene regulatory networks from clinical samples, opening the door for future diagnostic applications. Discussion Epigenomic studies of chromatin accessibility have yielded tremendous biological insights, but are currently limited in application by their complex workflows and large cell number requirements. While, improvements of existing methods may enable them to reach the similar performance, we believe ATAC-seq offers substantial advantages over existing technologies due to its speed, simplicity, and low input cell number requirement. ATAC-seq is an information rich assay, allowing simultaneous interrogation of factor occupancy, nucleosome positions in regulatory sites, and chromatin accessibility genome-wide. These insights are derived from both the position of insertion and the distribution of insert lengths captured during the transposition reaction. While extant methods such as DNase-and MNase-seq can provide some subsets of the information in ATAC-seq, they each require separate assays with large cell numbers, which increases the time, cost, and limits applicability to many systems. ATAC-seq also provides insert size "fingerprints" of biologically relevant genomic regions, suggesting that it capture information on chromatin compaction. We expect ATAC-seq to have broad applicability, significantly add to the genomics toolkit, and improve our understanding of gene regulation, particularly when integrated with other powerful rare cell techniques, such as FACS, laser capture microdissection (LCM) and recent advancements in RNA-seq 33, 34 . One potentially exciting application of ATAC-seq is to generate "personal epigenomic" profiles on a timescale compatible with clinical decision-making. We have optimized procedures to transform a clinical blood sample to completed sequencing library in 275 minutes. The reduced input requirements and rapid workflows, when coupled with the recent introduction of rapid-turnaround high-throughput sequencing instruments, such as the MiSeq and HiSeq2500, will enable investigation of personalized epigenetic landscapes of selected tissues both in the lab and the clinic. Of course, deeper analyses to generate global regulatory networks and other inferences will take additional time, and we anticipate that bioinformatic analyses-not the molecular biology or sequencing-will become the bottleneck of epigenomic studies in the future. We show that ATAC-seq is compatible with FACS, enabling studies on carefully sorted and rare subpopulations from primary tissues. We expect cellular subpopulations selected at different points in development and aging, and human diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and neuropsychiatric disorders are viable applications. In summary, we believe that the attractive combination of speed, simplicity and low input requirements of ATAC-seq will enable new gene regulatory insights into biology and medicine. Online Methods The ATAC-seq protocol has three major steps: 1. Prepare nuclei: To prepare nuclei, we spun 50,000 cells at 500 × g for 5 minutes, followed by a wash using 50 μL of cold 1x PBS and centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 minutes. Cells were lysed using cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). Immediately after lysis, nuclei were spun at 500 × g for 10 minutes using a refrigerated centrifuge. To avoid losing cells during the nuclei prep, we used a fixed angle centrifuge and carefully pipetted away from the pellet after centrifugations. Transpose and purify: Immediately following the nuclei prep, the pellet was resuspended in the transposase reaction mix (25 μL 2x TD buffer, 2.5 μL Transposase (Illumina) and 22.5 μL of nuclease free water). The transposition reaction was carried out for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Directly following transposition the sample was purified using a Qiagen Minelute kit. PCR: Following purification, we amplified library fragments using 1x NEBnext PCR master mix and 1.25 μM of custom Nextera PCR primers 1 and 2 (see table below), using the following PCR conditions: 72°C for 5 minutes, 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by thermocycling at 98°C for 10 seconds, 63°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 1 minute. To reduce GC and size bias in our PCR we monitored the PCR reaction using qPCR in order to stop amplification prior to saturation. To do this, we amplified the full libraries for 5 cycles, after 5 cycles we took an aliquot of the PCR reaction and added 10 μl of the PCR cocktail with Sybr Green at a final concentration of 0.6x. We ran this reaction for 20 cycles, to determine the additional number of cycles needed for the remaining 45 μL reaction. The libraries were purified using a Qiagen PCR cleanup kit yielding a final library concentration of ~30 nM in 20 μL. Libraries were amplified for a total of 10-12 cycles. Low cell number protocol To prepare the 500 and 5,000 cell reactions we used the same protocol with some notable exceptions: The transposition reaction was done in a 5 μL instead of 50 μL reaction. Also, we eliminated the Qiagen Minelute purification prior to PCR and instead took the 5 μL reaction immediately after transposition directly into the 50 μL PCR. Library QC and quantitation During the ATAC-seq protocol, we chose to avoid a size selection step to maximize the library complexity. The sequenced insert size is a distribution between 40 to 1 kb with a mean of ~120 bps. From bioanalyzer and gels we observed fragments >2 kb, which would make Qubit and other mass-based quantitation methods hard to interpret. For this reason we quantified our libraries using qPCR based methods. CD4 + enrichment from peripheral blood One green-top tube of whole blood was obtained from 1 normal volunteer three times over a 72-hour period, under a Stanford University IRB-approved protocol. Informed consent was obtained. 5mL of blood at each timepoint was negatively selected for CD4 + cells, using RosetteSep Human CD4 + T Cell Enrichment Cocktail (StemCell Technology). RosetteSep cocktail was incubated with the blood at 50 μL/mL for 20 min, diluted in an equal volume of PBS with 2% FBS, and underlayed with 15 mL Ficol-Paque Plus (GE). Blood was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 1200 × g without break, negatively selected cells were removed from the density medium: plasma interface, and cells were washed X2 in PBS with 2% FBS. FACS sorting peripheral blood leukocytes and GM cells GM 12878 cells were stained with DAPI NucBlue Fixed Cell Stain (molecular probes) and live cells were sorted using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) using a 100 μm nozzle. One peripheral blood sample (buffy coat) was stained with BD Bioscience antibodies CD14-A-488 (M5E2, 1:20), CD3-PE-Cy7 (SK7, 1:20), CD4-APC-Cy7 (RPA-T4, 1:20), and CD8 (RPA-T8, 1:20) for 20 minutes in the dark at RT. Cells were lysed using BDpharmLyse 1:10 dil in diH20 (BD) for 15 min, centrifuged for 5 minutes, washed with PBS 2% FBS X 2, and resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS. 50,000 CD3 + CD8 + , CD3 + CD4 + , and CD14 + cell populations were sorted into PBS with 10%FBS. Analysis Primary data processing-Data was collected using either 34 × 8 × 34 reads from a MiSeq or 50 × 8 × 50 reads on a HiSeq. Reads were aligned to hg19 using BOWTIE 36 using the parameters -X2000 and -m1. These parameters ensured that fragments up to 2 kb were allowed to align (-X2000) and that only unique aligning reads were collected (-m1). For all data files duplicates were removed using Picard. For peak calling and footprinting, we adjusted the read start sites to represent the center of the transposon binding event. Previous descriptions of the Tn5 transposase show that the transposon binds as a dimer and inserts two adapters separated by 9 bps (main text ref . 11). Therefore, all reads aligning to the + strand were offset by +4 bps, and all reads aligning to the -strand were offset -5 bps. ATAC-seq peak calling-We used ZINBA to call all reported ATAC-seq peaks in this manuscript. ZINBA was run using a window size of 300 bp and an offset 75 bp. Alignability was used to model the zero-inflated component and the ATAC-seq read count for the background and enriched components. Enriched regions were identified as those with a posterior probability >0.8. ATAC-seq insertion size enrichment analysis within chromatin annotations- First, the distribution of paired-end sequencing fragment sizes overlapping each chromatin state (http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/funcgen/regulatory_segmentation.html) were computed. The distributions were then normalized to the percent maximal within each state and enrichment was computed relative to the genome-wide set of fragment sizes. Nucleosome positioning-To generate the nucleosome position data track, we chose to split reads into various bins. Reads below 100 bps were considered nucleosome free, reads between 180 and 247 bps were considered to be mononucleosomes, reads between 315 and considered to be trinucleosomes (for determining cutoffs see Supplementary Figure 7 ). Dinucleosome reads were split into two reads and Trinucleosome reads were split into three reads. Reads were analyzed using Danpos and Dantools 22 using the parameters -p 1, -a 1, -d 20, -clonalcut 0. The background used was nucleosome free reads (reads less than 100 bps), allowing an effective negative weighting of these reads. This analysis allows calling multiple overlapping nucleosomes. Although generating nucleosome tracks using simple insert size cutoffs may yield false positives due to other nucleosome sized features, i.e. enhanaceosomes, we observed that we faithfully recapitulated global features on nucleosome position genome-wide (Fig 2c,d main text). ChIP-seq peak calling and clustering-ChIP-seq data was downloaded form the UCSC ENCODE repository, for a complete list of data use see supplementary table 2 . Peaks where called using GEM 37 , the parameters used where -k_min 6 -k_max 20. Inputs where used as a control for peak calling. Binding events were annotated by distance to the nearest dyad in bins of 10 bps. Factors were then hierarchically clustered using Euclidean distance and normalized by gene and centered by mean 38 . Footprinting using CENTIPEDE-The genome-wide set of motifs were obtained from the ENCODE motif repository (http://www.broadinstitute.org/~pouyak/encode-motif-disc/). The input for CENTIPEDE (main text ref. 27) included the PWM score, conservation (PhyloP) and ATAC-seq counts within +/-100bp of each genomic region matching a motif. ChIP-seq data was obtained from the UCSC ENCODE repository. Comparison of transcription factor regulatory networks-Transcription factor regulatory networks were constructed by comparing the GENCODE v14 genes with the genome-wide set of posterior probabilities estimated by CENTIPEDE for the respective celltypes. The extent of a transcription factor regulating each gene was determined by taking the sum of the weighed posterior probabilities for a given transcription factor mapping to the same chromosome. For each mapped motif the posterior probability was weighted based on the distance to the transcription start site for each gene. Comparison of transcription factor regulatory networks was computed as the correlation of each transcription factor in a given cell type with all transcription factors in the other cell type. The resulting correlation matrix was hierarchically clustered using the Pearson correlation coefficient and complete linkage 38 . Candidate IL2 enhancer analysis-We inspected ENCODE data on UCSC genome browser to identify putative IL2 enhancers in one or more cell types that may be responsive to FDA approved immomodulatory drugs. We scanned the intergenic region upstream of IL2 in hg19 for (i) enhancer-associated histone marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac), (ii) binding by one or more TFs as confirmed by ChIP-seq, and (iii) the TF pathway can be targeted by a human therapeutic. This analysis identified IRF4 and STAT3 binding sites in addition to the known NFAT-responsive elements (main text ref 28). Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

INTRODUCTION Neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system (Ramón y Cajal, 1888; Sherrington, 1906) . Individual neurons connect to one another via synapses to form neural circuits (De Robertis and Bennett, 1955) , and the concerted activities of neurons within circuits underlie all brain functions, including perception, cognition, and generation of behavior. Our limited ability to specifically map synaptically-connected neurons within circuits, or to selectively manipulate their functions, therefore, poses a major obstacle to understanding the workings of the brain. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, lack the resolution and precision needed to reveal synaptic connectivity, while most molecular genetic techniques are limited to the confines of the neurons for which markers exist. Other methods for circuit mapping, such as paired recording and optogeneticassisted circuit mapping, are labor intensive and low throughput. Serial electron microscopy is the gold standard for identifying synaptic connections within a circuit, but practical considerations limit the utility of this technique to analyzing small volumes of postmortem tissue. Further, this approach is not suitable for comprehensive analysis of variability among individuals (Briggman and Bock, 2012) . The use of genetically introduced tracers, such as plant lectins and bacterial toxins, has been invaluable towards understanding neuronal connectivity (Huh et al., 2010) . However, the utility of these tracers is limited by the lack of synaptic specificity and directionality. These tracers are further limited by their spread beyond one neuron and by the resulting dilution of the signal. The most commonly used transsynaptic tracing techniques in vertebrates rely on replication-deficient neurotropic viruses that are restricted to genetically defined neurons within a circuit (Callaway and Luo, 2015) . While most neurotropic viruses transport only in the retrograde direction, some anterograde viral tracers have been developed (Lo and Anderson, 2011; Zingg et al., 2017) . Two major limitations in the use of neurotropic viruses as tracers are the low efficiency of transsynaptic transport and the variability between experiments in the infected neuronal populations (Callaway and Luo, 2015) . Another significant problem with some viral tracers is their toxicity to the infected neurons that may lead to cell death and consequent infection of irrelevant bystander neurons (Callaway and Luo, 2015) . In spite of these limitations, rabies has been useful for retrograde tracing, but it is restricted to certain model organisms. By contrast, the utility of the anterograde viral tracers has been very limited. Several techniques use versions of fluorescent proteins to label synaptic connections or to trace circuits. Transsynaptic complementation of a split version of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is used in GRASP (GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners) to mark synapses (Feinberg et al., 2008; Gordon and Scott, 2009) . Each of the two complementary pieces of GFP is expressed by genetically-defined neuronal populations, and functional GFP is reconstituted when both pieces are in close proximity. Modified versions of GRASP have been developed to enhance its synaptic specificity by fusing at least one of the pieces of GFP to a synaptic protein (Fan et al., 2013; Macpherson et al., 2015) . Nonetheless, these methods only label synapses rather than whole cells, and it is therefore difficult to relate the GRASP signal to particular neurons. Further, none of the versions of GRASP can be used for tracing the projections of postsynaptic neurons. Another method for circuit tracing uses photoactivatable GFP, which is genetically encoded and locally photoconverted to its highfluorescence form to enable labeling of specific neural processes (Clowney et al., 2015; Datta et al., 2008; Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002; Ruta et al., 2010) . This approach achieves higher spatial specificity than that afforded by genetic markers, but is invasive, can label fibers-of-passage, and does not report connectivity. Finally, a major limitation of all of these tracing techniques is that they do not provide stable genetic access to the postsynaptic partners, and therefore they cannot be used to manipulate the function of the circuit. Tango-Trace is a technique that was developed to trace projections in the fly visual system (Jagadish et al., 2014) . It is based on Tango, an in vitro assay for recording the activation of receptors by their ligands (Barnea et al., 2008) . In Tango, a synthetic signaling pathway consisting of two fusion proteins converts the activation of a cell-surface receptor into reporter expression via site-specific proteolysis (Barnea et al., 2008) . Tango-Trace employed a configuration of Tango for detecting histamine, the excitatory neurotransmitter released from photoreceptors in the fly retina upon activation (Jagadish et al., 2014) . The utility of Tango-Trace has been rather limited because outside the retina histamine mostly serves as a neuromodulator rather than a neurotransmitter (Hong et al., 2006; Nässel, 1999) . Further, diffusion of histamine away from the synapse and consequent labeling of non-synaptic neurons is a potential problem with Tango-Trace. Here we describe trans-Tango, a method for anterograde transsynaptic tracing. While trans-Tango is also based on the Tango assay, its design is fundamentally different than Tango-Trace in order to generate a general and flexible transsynaptic labeling system. trans-Tango employs an exogenous ligand-receptor pair for circuit labeling, so in principle it can be applied to any neural circuit regardless of the neurotransmitter that it uses and without making any assumptions about the nature of the connection. To present the ligand, we introduce a third fusion protein in which the ligand is tethered to a synaptic protein via an extracellular spacer. This configuration directs the ligand to the synapse and prevents it from diffusing away. In trans-Tango, the Tango signaling pathway is introduced into all neurons in the animal. Specific labeling is achieved by presenting the tethered ligand at the synapses of genetically defined neurons, thereby activating the signaling pathway only in their postsynaptic partners. We designed trans-Tango in a modular fashion to allow easy integration with other genetic tools for circuit dissection and manipulation. We first validated trans-Tango in the olfactory system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where our experiments recapitulated known connections, but also revealed new ones. We then used trans-Tango to identify hitherto unknown second-order neurons in the Drosophila gustatory system. Our anatomical tracing experiments revealed that second-order gustatory neurons target brain areas known to be involved in neuromodulation and in controlling feeding behaviors, providing a possible pathway for integrating gustatory signals and the regulation of feeding. RESULTS Transsynaptic labeling by trans-Tango trans-Tango is a transsynaptic labeling system that is based on Tango, a cellular assay for recording the activation of specific receptors by their ligands (Barnea et al., 2008) . In Tango, a synthetic signaling pathway is activated in response to ligand binding to its receptor through a specific proteolytic event that releases a membrane-tethered transcription factor, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus and induce expression of a reporter (Barnea et al., 2008) . To attain anterograde labeling by trans-Tango, the core components of the signaling pathway are expressed panneuronally and the ligand that activates the pathway is presented at presynaptic sites in a neural circuit. Contact between the ligand and its receptor at synaptic sites drives expression of a reporter in postsynaptic neurons. The ligand and its receptor are exogenous to the animal in order to prevent spurious signal. To establish trans-Tango in Drosophila, we used human glucagon and its receptor as the ligand-receptor pair. The signaling pathway driving postsynaptic reporter expression consists of three components (Figure 1A ). The first is a fusion protein comprising the glucagon receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, bound at its cytoplasmic tail to the transcriptional activator QF (Potter et al., 2010) via a linker containing the cleavage site for the highly specific N1a protease from the tobacco etch virus (TEV) (Barnea et al., 2008) . The second component, hArr∷TEV, is a fusion between TEV and human β-arrestin2, a protein that is specifically recruited to activated G protein-coupled receptors (Barnea et al., 2008) . Panneuronal promoters drive expression of these two fusion proteins in all neurons. The third component in the pathway is a reporter, such as mtdTomato, under transcriptional control of QF. In this manner, all neurons in the fly are endowed with the capacity to express the reporter upon activation of the signaling pathway. The pathway is activated only in neurons that are postsynaptic to those that express a membrane-tethered form of glucagon at their presynaptic terminals (see below). In the absence of ligand at a given synapse, QF is sequestered to the membrane, and the reporter is not expressed (Figure 1A, top) . By contrast, at synapses where the ligand is expressed, transsynaptic activation of the receptor leads to recruitment of hArr∷TEV. Upon TEV cleavage in its target site, QF is released from the membrane, allowing it to enter the nucleus and induce reporter expression (Figure 1A , bottom). The inherent signal amplification by the signaling pathway renders trans-Tango very sensitive, and since the components of the signaling pathway are extrinsic to the cell, background noise can be kept low. Thus, trans-Tango should label circuits with high signal-to-noise ratios. In order to localize glucagon to the synapse and present it to postsynaptic receptors, we generated another fusion protein consisting of the cytosolic and transmembrane domains of the synaptic protein Drosophila Neurexin1, the large extracellular domain of the human celladhesion molecule ICAM1, a flexible linker including a myc-tag (Fortin et al., 2009) , and a mutated version of the glucagon peptide with high potency for glucagon receptor activation (Krstenansky et al., 1986) (Figures 1A and S1A) . The resulting trans-Tango ligand, which is sized to extend across the average length of a synapse, is enriched in axons (Figure S1B ) and targeted to axon termini (Figure S1C ). By contrast, another version of the tethered ligand in which glucagon is fused to CD4, a cell surface protein that lacks synaptic localization, resulted in ligand expression throughout the neuron (data not shown). To enhance the flexibility of trans-Tango, the expression of the ligand fusion protein is controlled by the Gal4-UAS binary system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993) , the most commonly used tool for genetic access in flies. To introduce the trans-Tango components into the fly, we generated a transgenic line bearing all three fusion proteins as a single allele (trans-Tango): (i) the receptor fusion, (ii) hArr∷TEV, and (iii) the ligand fusion (Figure S1A ). We did not detect any effect of panneuronal expression of the trans-Tango components on normal life span, development, brain morphology or motor behavior (data not shown). We generated a second transgenic line bearing a reporter allele containing a membrane-associated form of GFP under control of Gal4 (UAS-myrGFP) to mark presynaptic neurons, and a membrane-associated form of tdTomato under control of QF (QUAS-mtdTomato) to mark postsynaptic neurons (Figures 1A and S1A) . In this manner, any circuit for which a presynaptic Gal4 driver is available can in principle be traced by trans-Tango. To achieve this, flies bearing the trans-Tango and reporter alleles are crossed to flies bearing the appropriate Gal4 driver, and offspring carrying all three alleles are analyzed. Validating trans-Tango in the olfactory system We sought to validate trans-Tango in the context of the well-characterized olfactory system. Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express specific receptors and detect volatile odors. ORNs residing in the antenna and maxillary palp project to the antennal lobe (AL), where ORNs expressing a given receptor converge on the same neuropil structures called glomeruli. Axons from ORNs synapse with local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs) (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007) . LNs project locally to other glomeruli within the AL, while PNs project from the AL to the mushroom body (MB) calyx and the lateral horn (LH) mainly via the medial, mediolateral and lateral antennal lobe tracts (mALT, mlALT and lALT, respectively) (Ito et al., 2014) . We first used Orco-Gal4, which is expressed in the majority of ORNs (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007) , to drive expression of the trans-Tango ligand and myrGFP. In flies bearing the Orco-Gal4 driver and the trans-Tango components, we observed the typical innervation of the AL by GFP-expressing ORNs and robust mtdTomato labeling in LNs as well as in PNs that target the MB calyx and LH (Figure 1B and Movie S1). In addition, we observed projections descending to the subesophageal zone (SEZ), the first processing center for gustatory information in the brain (Ito et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2004) . We observed a total of 152±6 (mean±s.d.) and 182±17 postsynaptic neurons per hemisphere in females and males, respectively (n=10 ALs per group). By contrast, no signal, except two spots in the ventral SEZ, was detected in the brains of control flies bearing the trans-Tango components but no Gal4 driver, which is necessary for trans-Tango ligand expression (Figure 1C ). The background noise in the ventral SEZ might be due to sporadic leaky expression known to occur in the attP40 genomic locus where we integrated the trans-Tango allele (Pfeiffer et al., 2010) . These results demonstrate the tight regulation of ligand-dependent QF release and the consequent high signal-to-noise ratio of trans-Tango. Specificity of trans-Tango To examine the specificity of trans-Tango, we expressed the ligand in individual ORN classes. We started with one of the most studied olfactory circuits in flies, Or67d-expressing ORNs that target the DA1 glomeruli and mediate sexual behaviors (Datta et al., 2008; Jefferis et al., 2007; Kurtovic et al., 2007; Ruta et al., 2010) . Expression of the trans-Tango ligand in Or67d+ ORNs resulted in an extremely dense signal in LNs innervating many glomeruli including DA1, and also led to specific labeling of PNs targeting the MB calyx and LH (Figure 2A ). Additionally, we found bilateral descending projections from the AL to the SEZ (Figure 2A , arrows), as we noticed with the broadly expressed Orco-Gal4 (Figure 1B ). We observed a total of 61±5 and 81±4 postsynaptic neurons per hemisphere in females and males, respectively (n=10 ALs per group). In subsequent experiments, we expressed the ligand in Or42b-expressing ORNs that are important for detecting certain food odors (Root et al., 2011; Semmelhack and Wang, 2009) . We observed dense trans-Tango-dependent signal in LNs innervating many glomeruli, including the cognate DM1 glomerulus, as well as signal in a distinct set of PNs projecting to the MB calyx and LH (Figure 2B ). We observed a total of 86±7 and 92±5 postsynaptic neurons per hemisphere in females and males, respectively (n=10 ALs per group). It is noteworthy that the reporter in trans-Tango is integrated in the X chromosome, so due to dosage compensation, the signal in males is higher than in heterozygous females. Thus, while the cell number differences between males and females could reflect sexual dimorphism, they could also result from the difference in reporter levels. These results, together with trans-Tango labeling of other ORN classes (Figure S2 ), confirm the high degree of interconnectivity among glomeruli suggested by earlier studies (Chou et al., 2010; Seki et al., 2010) . While the general patterns of postsynaptic signal were similar for the various ORN populations, careful examination revealed notable differences. Namely, with ligand expressed in Or42b+ ORNs, we did not observe the neurons descending from the AL to the SEZ (Figures 2A and 2B, arrows) . In addition, the targeting patterns of the two PN populations within the LH were distinct, with projections from DA1 terminating in the ventral LH and those from DM1 terminating more dorsally (Figure 2A and 2B) . These projection patterns are in agreement with the literature (Jefferis et al., 2007; Strutz et al., 2014) . Finally, while we observed postsynaptic signal from both DA1 and DM1 throughout the AL, the signal distribution was not homogeneous and was different between the two. The postsynaptic signal from the DA1 glomerulus was sparser in the medial aspect of the AL, an area that includes DM1 among other glomeruli. By contrast, the postsynaptic signal from DM1 was sparser in the lateral aspect of the AL, an area that includes DA1 (Figures 2A and 2B ). The different postsynaptic signal patterns produced by driving trans-Tango ligand expression in different classes of ORNs, and the agreement with known projection patterns, suggest that trans-Tango reveals specific postsynaptic partners. In our attempts to optimize trans-Tango, we examined the effects of temperature and age on the trans-Tango signal. We found an inverse correlation between the trans-Tango signal and temperature over the range of 15-25°C, with the best signal-to-noise ratio observed at 18°C (Figure S3 ), while Gal4-dependent signal increased with temperature in this range as expected (Wilder and Perrimon, 1995) . In flies raised at 18°C, trans-Tango output labeling for three different populations of ORNs gradually increased with age, starting to saturate at approximately two weeks post-eclosion (Figure S4-S6 ). We therefore maintained the flies for all of our experiments at 18°C and analyzed them at least two weeks post-eclosion. It is noteworthy that we observed linkage between the strength of the Gal4 line used to drive the ligand and the intensity of the trans-Tango output signal (data not shown). This was apparent even when comparing different genomic integrations of the same Gal4 drivers (data not shown). Hence, the optimal age for analysis should be established empirically for each Gal4 driver of interest. Finally, we wished to examine individual variability in projection patterns among flies of the same genotype. We compared the postsynaptic projections from the DA1 and DM1 glomeruli in age-matched flies and observed consistent projection patterns within groups (Figure S7 -10). These results showcase the strength of trans-Tango as a genetic system to generate reproducible transsynaptic labeling results between individuals. Sparse Labeling of Postsynaptic Neurons with trans-Tango The widespread mtdTomato labeling in the AL impeded our ability to determine whether the labeled PNs were indeed receiving input from the proper glomerulus. We therefore pursued mosaic-labeling strategies to isolate individual postsynaptic neurons. We used trans-Tango in conjunction with MARCM (Lee and Luo, 1999; Potter et al., 2010) to label postsynaptic neurons singly or in small groups. Suppression of the QF-dependent postsynaptic signal was achieved with pancellular expression of QS (Potter et al., 2010) and relieved in stochastic subsets of cells by heat-shock. Importantly, MARCM analysis of postsynaptic neurons that were labeled via ligand expression in Or67d+ ORNs revealed PNs or LNs with dendrites arborizing within the DA1 glomerulus (Figure 3A , data not shown). Likewise, equivalent experiments with Or42b+ ORNs revealed neurons contacting the cognate DM1 glomerulus (data not shown). With both populations, obtaining single cell clones with MARCM was rare. Notably, when the ligand was expressed in Or67d+ ORNs, we obtained brains in which a single neuron projecting between the AL and SEZ was observed. This neuron innervates the DA1 glomerulus along with a number of other glomeruli (Figure 3A ). To further characterize the putative postsynaptic neurons of Or67d+ ORNs, we implemented an intersectional Flp-out strategy for trans-Tango, in which QF-dependent reporter expression required the FLP recombinase (Gordon and Scott, 2009; Potter et al., 2010) . By combining this intersectional reporter with initiation of trans-Tango labeling from Or67d+ ORNs, we were able to restrict labeling to Fru+ or GH146+ neurons (Figures 3B and 3C, respectively) . We observed 10±2 Fru+ PN cell bodies per hemisphere in females and 6±1 in males (n=12 ALs per group), and 23±2 GH146+ PNs in females and 23±3 in males (n=22 ALs for females and 20 for males). A similar strategy driving the system from Orco+ ORNs revealed 93±7 PNs in females and 98±6 in males (n=12 ALs per group). Interestingly, these intersectional experiments with ligand expressed in Or67d+ ORNs revealed that the neuron projecting from the AL to the SEZ is Fru+ (Figure 3B , arrows), suggesting that this neuron might play a role in connecting pheromone responses and gustation. Sensitivity and versatility of trans-Tango The adult olfactory circuits are characterized by a convergence of many ORNs onto the output neurons in the AL. This architecture results in concentration of the trans-Tango ligand from many neurons onto the postsynaptic neurons. Many other circuits are less convergent, and may not yield such concentration of ligand onto postsynaptic receptors. The ability to label postsynaptic partners of a single presynaptic neuron is essential for the precise characterization of circuits. We therefore sought to determine whether trans-Tango could illuminate output neurons that receive input from single ligand-expressing neurons. We chose to examine this in the larval olfactory system, in which distinct olfactory receptor genes are expressed by single ORNs (Fishilevich et al., 2005) . However, when we examined larvae carrying the trans-Tango allele, we observed mtdTomato expression in the ventral nerve cords (VNCs) of both the experimental and control larvae (data not shown). Careful examination of the VNCs revealed GFP expression, albeit faint (Figure 4A , asterisk), suggesting that our UAS promoters might be leaky in the larval VNC, leading to Gal4independent expression of ligand that induces trans-Tango mediated mtdTomato expression. This background labeling in the larval VNC is not observed in flies lacking the UASglucagon component (data not shown). We therefore decided to use an intersectional approach where the signal is limited to the olfactory system through the use of GH146-FLP together with a conditional suppressor (tubP-FRT-QS-FRT) that we have generated. In larvae bearing these alleles together with trans-Tango driven from Or42a+ ORNs, we observed 3±1 GH146+ PNs per hemisphere (n=22 ALs). (Figure 4A ). These results in the larval olfactory system suggest that trans-Tango is sensitive enough to label the outputs of single neurons. We note that because various circuits exhibit a range of densities of synapses, the sensitivity of trans-Tango may lessen in circuits with sparser synaptic contacts. To further determine whether trans-Tango could be used in circuits with other architectures, we investigated the peripheral visual system, where the architecture is mostly columnar (Morante and Desplan, 2008) . We expressed the trans-Tango ligand in lGMR+ photoreceptor cells and observed widespread postsynaptic labeling in the lamina and medulla (Figure 4B ). The implementation of trans-Tango to label visual circuits illustrates the flexibility of the system and its utility for studying circuits with diverse architectures and properties. Identifying second-order taste neurons and their projections in the brain We next turned our attention to the gustatory system, where relatively little is known about the postsynaptic partners of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) (Harris et al., 2015; Kain and Dahanukar, 2015; Kim et al., 2017; Miyazaki et al., 2015; Yapici et al., 2016) . GRNs express gustatory receptors (GRs) that detect non-volatile chemicals and are dispersed in various parts of the body, including the proboscis (labellum and pharynx), tarsal segments of the legs, wing margins, abdomen, intestine and female genitalia (Clyne et al., 2000; Dunipace et al., 2001; Scott et al., 2001; Vosshall and Stocker, 2007) . Each one of these peripheral gustatory organs is thought to contribute distinctly to the overall gustatory response of the fly to tastants (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007) . Distinct populations of GRNs respond to sweet and bitter tastants (Harris et al., 2015) . Like mammals, flies respond to sweet and bitter tastants with different behavioral outputs: sweet molecules are attractive and elicit acceptance, while bitter compounds are aversive and lead to rejection (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007) . The clear linkage between stimulus quality and behavioral response suggests differential representation of taste categories in the brain. Indeed, the projections of GRNs responding to sweet and bitter tastants segregate within the SEZ (Wang et al., 2004) . However, little is known about the nature of subsequent projections from the SEZ, or about how gustatory information is processed further to elicit the appropriate behavioral outputs. Seeking to identify second-order neurons in the gustatory system, we initiated expression of the trans-Tango ligand in Gr64f+ sweet GRNs. Expression of the trans-Tango ligand in Gr64f+ GRNs revealed extensive postsynaptic signal in the CNS (Figure 5A and 5B, Movie S2). Gr64f+ GRNs are present in each leg and either terminate in the thoracic ganglia or project directly to the posterior SEZ with collaterals in the thoracic ganglia (Figure 5A ) (Kwon et al., 2014; Thoma et al., 2016) . Gr64f+ GRNs also innervate the abdominal ganglion (Movie S2). Expression of the Tango ligand in Gr64f+ GRNs induced postsynaptic mtdTomato signal in each thoracic neuromere and in the abdominal ganglion in the VNC and in projections to the central brain (Figure 5A and 5B, Movie S2). In the central brain, expression of the trans-Tango ligand in Gr64f+ GRNs revealed a large number of postsynaptic neurons (Figure 5B , Movie S2). The observed signal was saturated in the vicinity of the SEZ, most likely due to dense interconnectivity. It was therefore difficult to precisely discern specific connections. Most of the distinguishable cell bodies of the second-order neurons resided external to the SEZ, in the cell body rind of neighboring neuropil structures such as the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC). Additional groups of cell bodies were located posteroventral and anterodorsal to the SEZ, as well as dorsal to the AL. Due to the intense mtdTomato labeling in the SEZ, we were unable to distinguish cell bodies from cell processes there (Figure 5B ). In addition to the dense signal in the vicinity of the SEZ, we observed projections to distant neuropil structures. These projections appeared to follow three major tracts: (i) an axon bundle that projected along the midline toward the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), where it arborized away from the midline; (ii) an axon bundle that traveled posterior to the AL and arborized in the superior intermediate protocerebrum (SIP) and superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP); and (iii) a thinner bundle that passed through the posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum and projected to the SLP and lateral protocerebrum (Figure 5B and 5D, Movie S2). Although the locations of the cell bodies varied across individuals, these projection tracts appeared to be stereotyped. These findings implicate the SMP, SIP and SLP as target areas for second-order neurons in the gustatory circuits. Following the naming convention of second-order olfactory pathways (Ito et al., 2014) , we refer to these gustatory tracts as medial, mediolateral, and lateral SEZ tracts (mSEZt, mlSEZt, and lSEZt, respectively). In order to discern the precise connectivity of second-order gustatory neurons and overcome the dense signal, we combined trans-Tango with MARCM, or FLP-out, to stochastically reveal labeling in clonal subsets of neurons postsynaptic to Gr64f+ GRNs (Figure 5C ). We observed many local interneurons that exhibited diverse arborizations within the SEZ (Figure 5C ). These neurons mainly inhabited the outer layer of the neighboring AMMC and sent diffuse processes that mostly arborized on the ipsilateral side (Figure 5C ). Neurons with similar morphology have been described (Kain and Dahanukar, 2015; Miyazaki et al., 2015; Yapici et al., 2016) . We also observed clusters of neurons that projected to the SMP, SIP and SLP. Our experiments revealed two distinct clusters of neurons that projected through the mSEZt: a cluster of cell bodies posteroventral to the SEZ and a cluster anterodorsal to the SEZ (Figure 5C ). Neurons in the posteroventral cluster received input from the ipsilateral SEZ and projected to the ipsilateral SMP, where they branched laterally. By contrast, neurons in the anterodorsal cluster received input from both sides of the SEZ and projected to the SMP, where they branched bilaterally. We observed a single cluster of neurons that projected through mlSEZt (Figure 5C ). The cell bodies of these neurons resided anterodorsal to the AL. They received input mostly from the contralateral SEZ, with a faint connection to the ipsilateral SEZ, and projected contralaterally, forming crescent-shaped terminals in the SIP/SLP. Interestingly, neurons with similar morphology were previously described as being sexually dimorphic, with females having fewer neurons and lacking input from the ipsilateral SEZ (Chiang et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2005) . Indeed, comparison between these neurons in female and male brains revealed that their morphology is different; in females the fiber connecting the cell bodies and the ipsilateral SEZ is missing (data not shown). Finally, we observed two clusters of neurons projecting through the lSEZt. The cell bodies of neurons within the first cluster resided in the cell body rind of the AMMC (Figure 5C ). These neurons extended dense arborizations into the ipsilateral SEZ and more sparse arborizations into the medial aspect of the contralateral SEZ. Following the lSEZt, they projected largely to the ipsilateral SLP with minor collaterals in the lateral protocerebrum. The cell bodies of the neurons within the second cluster projecting through the lSEZt resided near the abdominal ganglion in the VNC (Figure 5C ). These neurons cross the midline and ascend towards the central brain receiving input from each contralateral leg neuromere. In the central brain, they extended dense arborizations into the contralateral SEZ and some continue through the lSEZt to the contralateral SLP with minor collaterals in the lateral protocerebrum (Figure 5C ). Similar long-range sweet projection neurons have been recently described (Kim et al., 2017) . Interestingly, neurons with similar morphology were also described for pheromone detection (Clowney et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2010) . It is noteworthy that each cluster of postsynaptic neurons projected along a single tract; we never observed a neuron with parallel projections through multiple tracts (Figure 5C ). While we have described here the most common projections, we also observed other projection neurons from the SEZ to the protocerebrum that did not fit in these clusters (Movie S2 and data not shown). Neurons with similar morphologies to all the classes of second-order gustatory neurons that we have identified had been described in single cell resolution (Chiang et al., 2011) . DISCUSSION In this study, we describe trans-Tango, a method that we have developed for transsynaptic mapping and manipulation of neural circuits in the anterograde direction. The design of trans-Tango is based on the Tango assay for recording ligand-receptor interactions (Barnea et al., 2008) . The Tango assay was also the basis for two earlier in vivo systems in Drosophila: TANGO-map, a method for identifying sites of neuromodulation (Inagaki et al., 2012) , and Tango-Trace, which was used to functionally map projections in the visual system (Jagadish et al., 2014) . Both of these techniques used the Tango design for detecting endogenous ligands (dopamine in TANGO-map, histamine in Tango-Trace). Unlike these earlier Tango-based systems, trans-Tango employs exogenous ligand and receptor for circuit labeling, so in principle it can be applied to any neural circuit regardless of the neurotransmitter that it uses. Further, since in trans-Tango the ligand is tethered to a synaptic protein it does not diffuse away from the synapse, a potential problem with Tango-Trace (Jagadish et al., 2014) . Thus, trans-Tango is truly a general and flexible transsynaptic labeling technique that allows discovery of unknown synaptic partners and circuit elements without any assumptions or previous knowledge about the nature of these connections. In this manner, trans-Tango is a powerful tool for generating hypotheses regarding potential connectivity. Unlike other techniques for anterograde tracing, such as dye injection or the use of neurotropic viruses, trans-Tango is immune to signal diffusion. Further, as it can be readily combined with mosaic or intersectional approaches for sparse labeling of postsynaptic neurons, trans-Tango is especially suitable for tracing projections within dense neuropil. Our experiments revealed an inverse correlation between the intensity of the postsynaptic trans-Tango signal and the temperature in which the flies were raised over the range of 15-25°C. To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, we maintained the flies for all of our experiments at 18°C. It is noteworthy that this inverse correlation extends beyond signal intensity per neuron. Indeed, we consistently observe signal in more neurons at lower temperatures (15-18°C) than at 25°C. We believe that as flies are ectotherms this difference could reflect the effect of the low temperature on biological processes, such as pruning. Alternatively, this phenomenon could be directly related to features of trans-Tango. For example, it is conceivable that the folding of the synthetic fusion proteins in trans-Tango is more efficient at lower temperature, or that their turnover is slower, such that the concentrations of the various components are higher. Otherwise, perhaps the kinetics of the various interactions in trans-Tango (e.g. ligand-receptor interaction, recruitment of β-arrestin2 to the activated receptor, processivity of TEV, interaction between QF and QUAS, etc.) is differentially affected by temperature such that the signaling pathway is sensitized. In both cases, the overall sensitivity of the system would be much higher at lower temperatures. Consequently, even transient interactions between axons during development might result in some signal. Whatever the explanation, this phenomenon could in fact act as a knob that controls the gain of the system, and it should be considered when using it. When the goal is to reveal as many potential postsynaptic partners as possible, the flies should be raised at 15-18°C, but when a more stringent assessment of connectivity is desired, the flies should be raised at 25°C. This phenomenon also impacted the interpretation of the numbers of postsynaptic neurons that we observed compared to the literature, as most published data are obtained at 25°C. Comparison of the numbers of postsynaptic neurons that we have observed with the available published numbers revealed that in some cases, our numbers corresponded with the published numbers while in others, our numbers were higher. For example, earlier studies revealed that Or67d+ ORNs provide input onto six Fru+ PNs both in females and males (Datta et al., 2008; Ruta et al., 2010) . In our experiments driving trans-Tango from Or67d+ ORNs and restricting the signal to Fru+ neurons, we observed 10±2 Fru+ PN cell bodies per hemisphere in females and 6±1 in males, suggesting thorough labeling of postsynaptic partners by trans-Tango. However, we observed 23±2 GH146+ PNs in females and 23±3 in males. These numbers are higher than the numbers published recently: 8±2 uniglomerular PNs in females and 10±1 uniglomerular PNs in males (Grabe et al., 2016) . This trend extends to the number of PNs associated with other glomeruli (data not shown). Similarly, when we drive trans-Tango from Or42a+ ORNs in larvae, we observed 3±1 GH146+ PNs compared to the suggested one PN (Ramaekers et al., 2005) . The higher numbers observed with trans-Tango could of course represent false-positive signal that might have resulted from inefficient synaptic localization of the ligand due to its overexpression, as was observed for synaptic GRASP (Chen et al., 2014) . Such ligand mislocalization could have been exacerbated by the relatively late age in which we analyze the flies. In considering this discrepancy further, it is noteworthy that we chose to bias the current configuration of trans-Tango towards high sensitivity even at the expense of increasing the number of false positives. In this vein, we intentionally counted cells in a non-stringent manner; we counted cells even if the signal in them was faint in order to reveal any potential postsynaptic neurons. This was especially significant in the anterodorsal cluster of PNs in the olfactory system where we often saw weak signal. The difference in numbers could also be explained by the experimental approach: our numbers resulted from intersectional experiments where FLP was used, while the published numbers were generated using Gal4. As discussed earlier, temperature could be a major factor: all of our experiments were conducted at 18°C where the signal-to-noise with trans-Tango is optimal, but the system is more sensitive. Indeed, when the flies were raised at 25°C and PNs were counted at a younger age, the numbers observed were closer to the published numbers: 14±2 and 18±2 GH146+ PNs in females and males, respectively (n=12 ALs per group). The choice of the reporter used to reveal the postsynaptic signal is another factor that affects the numbers. In our attempts to optimize trans-Tango, we tested several available QUAS reporters as well as a few that we generated (data not shown). In the experiments aimed at revealing the totality of postsynaptic partners, we used the reporter that we generated as it yielded the best signal-tonoise ratio. However, the signal with this reporter was not sufficiently strong to obtain comprehensive labeling of postsynaptic partners in intersectional experiments where we used a conditional suppressor: we observed only 5±2 and 8±2 GH146+ PNs in females and males, respectively (n=10 ALs per group). To avoid underrepresentation, we chose to use one of the more sensitive reporters (Potter et al., 2010) that consistently labeled more neurons even at the expense of potential false-positive signal. The use of this reporter could have contributed to the higher cell numbers observed in the intersectional experiments. In conclusion, trans-Tango is a powerful tool for generating hypotheses regarding connectivity. Like any other technique, connections revealed by trans-Tango will require further functional validation. Since trans-Tango provides genetic access to the postsynaptic neurons, future versions of trans-Tango incorporating calcium indicators, such as GCaMP6 (Chen et al., 2013) , as readout might facilitate such validation in circuits of interest. When we assessed the age-dependence of the trans-Tango signal, we observed three additional glomeruli in young animals when the ligand was driven in Or42b+ ORNs (Figure S4 ). By contrast, we never saw additional glomeruli when we analyzed Or67d+ ORNs (Figure S5 ). Careful examination of both the antennae and the AL revealed that these supernumerary glomeruli correspond to the neighboring neurons of Or42b+ ORNs within the ab1 sensilla (Or10a→DL1, Or92a→VA2, Gr21a→V), suggesting interactions between axons within the bundle. These interactions could be biologically significant or simply an artifact/noise of trans-Tango due to ligand mislocalization. Interestingly, when we drove ligand expression from Or92a+ ORNs that also reside in ab1 sensilla, we did not observe signal in the glomeruli of the other ORNs (Figure S6 ). Importantly, the strength of the Or42b-Gal4 and Or92a-Gal4 drivers is similarly high. Therefore, the different patterns of staining with these ORN populations likely reflect their biology. In our validation experiments in the olfactory system, we induced ligand expression in different populations of ORNs and observed postsynaptic signal spanning the entire AL, as expected due to the panglomerular LNs (Chou et al., 2010) . However, we noticed that the postsynaptic signal is not homogeneously distributed throughout the AL (Figures 2 and S2 ). Closer inspection revealed that the two classes of ORNs that detect pheromones (Or67d-and Or47b-expressing ORNs, targeting DA1 and VA1v, respectively) share the pattern of postsynaptic signal with sparser labeling of the medial aspect of the AL, an area that includes DM1 and VA2 (cognate glomeruli of Or42b and Or92a, respectively). By contrast, the two classes of ORNs known to detect food odors (Or42b and Or92a) share a different pattern of postsynaptic signal that is sparser in the lateral aspect of the AL, an area that includes DA1 and VA1v. The differences in postsynaptic patterns between the classes of glomeruli suggest that the segregation of food and pheromone channels observed in the targeting patterns of PNs in the LH (Jefferis et al., 2007) might be extended back to the AL, particularly to LNs. Such LNs that avoid certain glomeruli have been previously described (Chou et al., 2010) . Interestingly, there is an inverse correlation between the odor-evoked firing rates of an LN and the number of glomeruli connected to it (Chou et al., 2010) . It is conceivable that this inverse correlation is reflected in connectivity and extends to the numbers or sizes of synapses with ORNs. Therefore, it is possible that the connections between panglomerular LNs and ORNs are not strong enough to elicit robust trans-Tango signal. Notably, the synapses of panglomerular LNs were only revealed using a pre-synaptic marker (synaptotagmin-HA) and not by a post-synaptic marker (Chou et al., 2010) . Therefore, it is conceivable that at least some of these LNs send output to all glomeruli while not receiving input from all glomeruli. Such LNs would not be detected by trans-Tango. We revealed a connection between some glomeruli in the antennal lobe, including DA1 and VA1v, and the SEZ (Figures 1B, 2A , S2A, and Movie S1). These glomeruli are involved in pheromone detection, and the neuron connecting the two brain areas is Fru + (Figure 3B and data not shown). Our observations could implicate this neuron in connecting olfactory pheromone responses and gustation. Other functional connections between pheromone detection and gustatory behavior have been recently reported (Clowney et al., 2015) . The new features that we have identified in the well-studied olfactory circuits illustrate the power of trans-Tango to provide a comprehensive map of projections from a given neuron while maintaining the capacity to integrate clonal analysis for sparse labeling. The implementation of trans-Tango in the gustatory system enabled us to identify previously unknown second-order neurons and trace their projections. Our study identified different areas in the protocerebrum (SMP, SIP and SLP) as the targets of the second-order neurons in the gustatory circuits. The SMP is associated with neuroendocrine centers, such as the pars intercerebralis (PI), which regulate various behaviors including feeding (Nassel et al., 2013) . Several neuropeptides that control feeding behaviors are secreted from cells associated with the SMP (Nassel et al., 2013) . For example, insulin-producing cells located in the PI have dendritic branches in the dorsal SMP (Kapan et al., 2012) . Thus, the direct input from the SEZ to the SMP via the mSEZt (Figure 5 , Movie S2) provides a possible pathway for integrating gustatory signals and the regulation of feeding behavior. The SMP is also a target of the MB output neurons (MBONs) and it harbors the dendrites of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that terminate in the MB (Aso et al., 2014) . Similarly, the SIP and SLP contain processes of MBONs and DANs (Aso et al., 2014) . In the MB, MBONs integrate dopamine input from DANs to mediate behavioral output. Several studies revealed that sugar-induced activity in a subset of DANs elicits appetitive memory (Burke et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012) . Remarkably, the projections through the three main gustatory tracts do not innervate the MB. This is in stark contrast to the olfactory circuits where second-order neurons massively project to the MB. Thus, gustatory information might be relayed into the MB at a higher level in the gustatory circuits. The direct input from the SEZ to the SMP, SIP and SLP could provide the anatomical framework for gustatory learning. However, it is possible that such second-order gustatory neurons with termini in the MB do exist, but for some reason trans-Tango fails to reveal them. The design of trans-Tango is modular, so it is not limited to tracing experiments. Since the readout of trans-Tango is transcription of a reporter gene, the system can be readily configured for functional experiments in which the activity of second-order neurons is altered (e.g. by incorporating optogenetic proteins as the reporter) or monitored (e.g. by incorporating calcium sensors as the reporter). Further, the trans-Tango design could be implemented in other organisms via viral delivery of the necessary components or by introducing them through genome editing techniques. In essence, trans-Tango provides genetic access to cells on the basis of their connectivity. Thus, trans-Tango expands the utility of molecular genetic techniques beyond the confines of a given cell. Finally, though we have presented trans-Tango as a neural circuit tracing technique, the same design could be used, with minor modifications, to study transient interactions between cells in other contexts, such as during development, in the immune system, or in cancer.

A list of the full genotypes for the flies used in each figure is in Table S1 . Generation of Transgenic Fly Lines-Plasmids used in this study to generate transgenic fly lines (described in Figure S1A in detail) were constructed using standard cloning techniques including restriction digest and ligation, PCR assembly and Gibson Assembly, and were sequenced before injection. The plasmid used for the generation of trans-Tango transgenic flies was constructed by standard molecular cloning techniques. A scaffold of unique restriction sites was ligated into pBluescript KS+ (pBS KS+; Agilent). The following DNA sequences were PCR amplified to add appropriate restriction sites and ligated into the pJET1.2 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific): the Elav promoter, obtained from Drosophila genomic DNA; the Arrestin∷TEV protease fusion (hArr∷TEV) (Barnea et al., 2008) ; the SV40 polyadenylation sequence (SV40pA), which was obtained from pUASTattB vector (Bischof et al., 2007) ; the nSyb promoter; the Drosophila Synthetic Core Promoter (DSCP) (Pfeiffer et al., 2008) ; human glucagon receptor; the serine TEV cleavage site (TEVcs); QF, obtained from pattB-QF-hsp70 (Addgene, 24368) (Potter et al., 2010) , and the hsp70 polyadenylation sequence (hsp70pA), obtained from pattB-QF-hsp70. These sequences were digested from pJET1.2 and ligated into the pBS KS+ scaffold in a hierarchical manner, resulting in two cassettes from 5′ to 3′: Elav-hArr∷TEV-SV40pA, nSyb-DSCP-hGCGR∷TEVcs∷QF-hsp70pA (panneuronal cassettes). A second scaffold of unique restriction sites was generated and ligated into pUASTattB between the white gene and the attB sequence. The panneuronal cassettes were digested and ligated in an inverted manner (3′ to 5′) into the modified pUASTattB scaffold. To assemble the trans-Tango ligand, the following DNA sequences were amplified with overlapping 5′ and 3′ sequences: 10xUAS-IVS-Syn21, obtained from pJFRC81 (Addgene, 36432) (Pfeiffer et al., 2012) ; trypsin signal peptide, followed by human glucagon peptide, six Glycine-Asparagine (GN) repeats, myc-tag, and nine GN repeats (Fortin et al., 2009) ; the extracellular domain of human ICAM1, from the last isoleucine residue of the transmembrane domain to the Nterminus of the extracellular domain, obtained from cDNA (VersaClone); Drosophila Neurexin1, from the C-terminal cytosolic tail through the transmembrane domain (not including the last isoleucine residue), obtained from Drosophila genomic DNA, and the p10 polyadenylation sequence, obtained from pJFRC81. These sequences were covalently fused to each other by Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs) (Gibson et al., 2009) . They were subsequently amplified in two pieces to introduce super-agonist mutations to the glucagon peptide (Krstenansky et al., 1986) , and were finally assembled by Gibson Assembly, from 5′ to 3′, into the pUASTattB scaffold containing the panneuronal cassettes in the opposite orientation. The plasmid used for the generation of reporter flies, UAS-myrGFP and QUAS-mtdTomato(3xHA), was constructed by Gibson Assembly. The 5xQUAS-mtdTomato(3xHA) sequence, obtained from pQUAST-mtdT-3xHA (Addgene, 24354) (Potter et al., 2010) , and the hsp70pA sequence were amplified by PCR with appropriate overlaps. These sequences were assembled into the pJFRC12 plasmid (Addgene, 26222) (Pfeiffer et al., 2010) following the existing GFP cassette and in the reverse orientation. The plasmid used to generate tubP-FRT-QS-FRT conditional suppressor transgenic flies was constructed by Gibson Assembly. The tubulin promoter and the first FRT site, as well as the WPRE, the SV40pA and the second FRT site were amplified from tubP-FRT>GAL80-6-FRT> (Addgene, 63173) (Nern et al., 2015) , and the QS sequence was amplified from ptubP-QS (Addgene, 24352) (Potter et al., 2010) . All PCR amplifications were performed with the appropriate overlaps and the pieces were assembled into the pUASTattB vector. Lines of transgenic flies were generated by site-directed genomic integration of constructs using the PhiC31 system (Groth et al., 2004; Markstein et al., 2008) . The trans-Tango construct containing ligand, synthetic receptor and hArr∷TEV genes was incorporated at the attP40 site. The construct containing the reporter genes, UAS-myrGFP and QUAS-mtdTomato(3xHA), was incorporated at the su(Hw)attP8 site. The conditional suppressor construct, tubP-FRT-QS-FRT, was incorporated at the VK00018 site. METHOD DETAILS Mosaic Analysis-MARCM experiments for postsynaptic signal in the olfactory and gustatory systems were performed as described previously (Lee and Luo, 1999; Potter and Luo, 2011) . Briefly, flies of genotype UAS-myrGFP, QUAS-mtdTomato(3xHA), hsFLP (X); trans-Tango, FRT G13 , tubP-QS(5A)/FRT G13 (II); Or67d-Gal4/+ (III), and UAS-myrGFP, QUAS-mtdTomato(3xHA), hsFLP (X); trans-Tango, FRT G13 , tubP-QS(5A)/FRT G13 , Gr64f-Gal4 (II) were raised at 18°C and transiently heat-shocked in a 37°C water bath for 2 min to 1 hr during early third instar larval stage. Intersectional analysis of postsynaptic signal of Or67d+ neurons was performed using flies of the following genotypes: w (X); trans-Tango, GH146-FLP/+ (II); Or67d-Gal4/QUAS-FRT-STOP-FRT-mCD8∷GFP, UAS-mtdTomato (III), and w (X); trans-Tango/+ (II); Or67d-Gal4, fru-FLP/QUAS-FRT-STOP-FRT-mCD8∷GFP, UAS-mtdTomato (III). Intersectional FLP-out analysis of postsynaptic signal of Or42a+ neurons was performed using larvae of the following genotypes: UAS-myrGFP, QUAS-mtdTomato(3xHA) (X); trans-Tango, GH146-FLP, tubP-FRT-QS-FRT/Or42a-Gal4 (II). Clonal FLP-out analysis of postsynaptic signal of Gr64f+ neurons was performed using flies of the following genotypes: UAS-myrGFP, QUAS-mtdTomato(3xHA) (X); trans-Tango, tubP-FRT-QS-FRT/Gr64f-Gal4, hsFLP (II). Flies were raised at 18°C and transiently heat-shocked in a 37°C water bath for 5 to 15 min during late pupal stages to generate random clones that lack QS expression. Immunohistochemistry and Data Processing-Immunohistochemistry experiments were performed as described previously (Wu and Luo, 2006) with minor modifications. Briefly, either adult flies that are 15-20 days old (unless otherwise noted) or third instar wandering larvae were cold anaesthetized on ice and dissected in PBS or 0.03%PBST (T stands for Triton X-100; Fisher Bioreagents, BP151-500). After a 30 min fixation of samples in 4%PFA/0.3%PBST at room temperature (RT) or an overnight fixation in 2%PFA/ 0.3%PBST at 4°C, samples were washed four times for 15 min in 0.3%PBST at RT, blocked in 5% heat-inactivated donkey or equine serum (diluted from 100% with 0.3% PBST) for 30 min at RT, and incubated with primary antibodies for two overnights at 4°C. Samples were washed again four times for 15 min at RT and incubated with secondary antibodies for two overnights at 4°C. The samples were then washed again four times for 15 min at RT and mounted on a slide (Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus, 12-550-15) using Fluoromount-G mounting medium (SouthernBiotech, 0100-01). Samples used for generating supplemental videos and cell-counting data were cleared as described previously (Nern et al., 2015) . The primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. The primary antibodies used in this study were anti-GFP rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11122; 1:1000), anti-HA mouse (Covance, MMS-101P; 1:250), anti-HA rat (Roche, 11867423001; 1:100), antimyc mouse (Covance, MMS-150P; 1:250), anti-Brp mouse (nc82; DSHB; 1:50) and anti-Ncad rat (DSHB; 1:20). Secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:1000 and were as follows: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 488, donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 555, goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor® 555, donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 647 and goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor® 647. Images were taken using confocal microscopy (Zeiss, LSM800) with ZEN software (Zeiss, version 2.1) with auto Z brightness correction to generate a homogeneous signal where it seemed necessary, and were formatted using Fiji software (http://fiji.sc) or Adobe Photoshop CC. Supplemental videos were generated using Imaris software (Bitplane AG, version 8.4.1) with tiled confocal images taken with low laser settings. Figures were generated using Adobe Illustrator CC. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Quantification of Postsynaptic Neurons-Confocal images taken with laser and microscope settings held constant within groups were used to quantify the postsynaptic neurons revealed by trans-Tango. Cell bodies were counted manually using cell counter plugin in Fiji in a non-stringent manner: cells were counted even if the signal in them was weak in order to reveal any potential connection. Number of samples used for cell-counting data is reported in the results and discussion sections. Pixel Intensity Measurement-HA and myc immunofluorescence were imaged in separate channels using confocal microscopy, and all laser and microscope settings were held constant for all brains. Pixel intensities were calculated using Fiji. For a given z-stack of a brain, the selection brush feature was used to draw a circular ROI of fixed diameter over either the entire left antennal lobe (to quantify HA staining) or the entire left DA1 glomerulus (to quantify myc staining). For each frame of the stack, average pixel intensity within the ROI was calculated. For myc, this average pixel intensity in each frame was normalized by subtracting out the average pixel intensity of an unstained region within the antennal lobe. The maximum value of this average pixel intensity across all frames of the stack was determined and reported. Number of samples used to determine the average pixel intensity is reported in the figure legend. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. Design and Implementation of trans-Tango in the Fly Olfactory System (A) Schematic design of trans-Tango. The general design of trans-Tango is based on the Tango assay in a configuration for human glucagon. In trans-Tango, the components of the Tango signaling pathway (hGCGR∷TEVcs∷QF and hArr∷TEV) are expressed in all neurons, rendering them competent for QF-dependent expression of Reporter 2 (red). The signaling pathway is transsynaptically activated by a membrane-tethered form of glucagon that is fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the Drosophila synaptic protein Neurexin1 via a spacer consisting of the extracellular domain of the human cell adhesion molecule ICAM1 and a flexible linker (hGCG∷hICAM1∷dNRXN1). Expression of the ligand fusion and Reporter 1 (green -to mark the presynaptic neuron) are Gal4 dependent. In the absence of ligand, the transcription factor QF stays tethered to the receptor; hence, there is no expression of Reporter 2 (top). Ligand expression in the presynaptic neuron activates the signaling pathway in the postsynaptic neuron, releasing QF to translocate into the nucleus and initiate Reporter 2 expression from QUAS (bottom). (B) In flies bearing the trans-Tango components, driving ligand and myrGFP expression in the majority of ORNs targeting the AL by Orco-Gal4 (green) results in mtdTomato expression in postsynaptic LNs and PNs (red). (C) No signal is observed in flies bearing the trans-Tango components without a Gal4 driver, except for some background noise in the ventral SEZ. (B and C) The right panels are zoom-in on the AL. Max-projection pictures of whole-mount brains are shown. Blue, neuropil counterstain. Scale bars, 50 μm. See also Figure S1 and Movie S1. Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2.

Sparse Labeling of Postsynaptic Neurons with trans-Tango (A) Sparse labeling of postsynaptic neurons through combining trans-Tango with MARCM. Clones of different postsynaptic neurons (red) receiving input from the DA1 glomerulus (green) are shown for four different individuals. (B and C) Sparse labeling of geneticallydefined postsynaptic neurons via FLP recombination. Combining trans-Tango with FLP recombination enables intersectional labeling of FLP+ postsynaptic neurons. Postsynaptic signal is expressed by removing the stop cassette in the conditional reporter (red) using fru-FLP (B), and GH146-FLP (C). Arrows in (B) point to the neurons descending to the SEZ. The right panels are zoom-in on the AL and LH. (A-C) Max-projection pictures of wholemount brains are shown. Blue, neuropil counterstain. Scale bars, 50 μm. Figure 4 . 4 Figure 4. Sensitivity of trans-Tango (A) Expression of the trans-Tango ligand in Or42a+ ORNs in the larva (a single ORN per side, green, arrows) leads to labeling of PNs (red, arrowheads). trans-Tango is combined with intersectional genetics to restrict the postsynaptic signal to GH146-FLP+ PNs, as the leakiness of the UAS promoter in the larval ventral nerve cord (green, asterisks) results in background noise (data not shown). In the lower zoom-in panels of the larval central brain, the AL, MB calyx and LH are indicated by dashed lines in yellow, white and green, respectively. Max-projection pictures of whole-mount brains are shown. (B) Implementation of trans-Tango in the visual system. Expression of the ligand in lGMR+ photoreceptor cells (green) induces postsynaptic signal (red) in the lamina (arrowhead) and medulla (arrow).

increased (Fig. 1c ). In the aversive block, anticipatory blinking increased as the probability of airpuff increased (Fig. 1d ). While the monkeys were conditioned using the Pavlovian procedure, we recorded single unit activity from 103 putative dopamine neurons (68 in monkey N and 35 in monkey D) in and around the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Their electrophysiological properties were distinctly different from other neurons in the SNc and VTA (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), and hereafter we call them dopamine neurons. Most previous studies on midbrain dopamine neurons have characterized dopamine neurons as a functionally homogeneous population 1 . We found that this is not true.Figure 2a and e show the activity of two dopamine neurons, separately for different CSs. Their activity was similar in the appetitive block (top row). Both of them were excited by 100% reward CS (the CS associated with reward with 100% probability). This excitation decreased in response to 50% reward CS, and even changed to an inhibition in response to 0% reward CS. However, the dopamine neurons showed completely different responses in the aversive block (bottom row). In response to 100% airpuff CS, the neuron shown in Fig. 2a was inhibited whereas the neuron shown in Fig. 2e was excited. Furthermore, as the probability of airpuff decreased, their response magnitudes were graded in opposite directions. In order to characterize the CS-evoked responses, we classified the 103 neurons into three groups based on the response to 100% airpuff CS (Supplementary table 1 ). Neurons showing a significant inhibition and excitation were classified as airpuff CS inhibited type (ACSinhibited type, n=24) and airpuff CS excited type (ACS-excited type, n=38), respectively (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Neurons showing no significant response were classified as airpuff CS non-responsive type (ACS-nonresponsive type, n=41) (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon signedrank test). The CS-evoked responses of individual neurons are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary table 2. In the following, we will focus on the ACS-inhibited and ACSexcited type neurons (see Supplementary Fig. 3 for ACS-nonresponsive type neurons, see also Supplementary note A and Supplementary table 3 for the electrophysiological properties of each type). The averaged activity of the ACS-inhibited type neurons was modulated by the reward probability (Fig. 2b ) and airpuff probability (Fig. 2c ) in the opposite directions. The excitatory response to the reward CS decreased and reversed to an inhibition as the reward probability decreased (Fig. 2b , red line in Fig. 2d ). In contrast, the inhibitory response to the airpuff CS decreased as the airpuff probability decreased (Fig. 2c , blue line in Fig. 2d ). The same trend was found in individual ACS-inhibited type neurons (Supplementary note B and Supplementary Fig. 4a ). These results suggest that the ACS-inhibited type neurons encode motivational value on a single scale, most strongly excited in response to the most positive stimulus (100% reward CS) and most strongly inhibited in response to the most negative stimulus (100% airpuff CS). The averaged activity of the ACS-excited type neurons was also modulated by the reward probability (Fig. 2f ) and airpuff probability (Fig. 2g ), but in the same direction. The excitatory response decreased as the outcome probability decreased for both of reward-and airpuffpredicting CSs (Fig. 2h , see also Supplementary note B and Supplementary Fig. 4b for individual neurons). These results suggest that the ACS-excited type neurons do not encode motivational value. Previous studies have repeatedly shown that dopamine neurons were excited by reward itself when it was unexpected 1 . On the other hand, it is still debatable whether they are excited or inhibited by aversive stimuli and, if so, in what context. Figure 3a shows the responses of the same neuron shown in Fig. 2a to reward and airpuff. This neuron was strongly excited when reward was presented without preceding CS (free reward) and inhibited when airpuff was presented without preceding CS (free airpuff), consistent with value coding. In contrast, the neuron shown in Fig. 3e was excited by both free reward and free airpuff. We then re-classified the 103 neurons into three groups based on the response to free airpuff (Supplementary table 1 ). Neurons showing a significant inhibition and excitation were classified as airpuff US inhibited type (AUS-inhibited type, n=47) and airpuff US excited type (AUS-excited type, n=11), respectively (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Neurons showing no significant response were classified as airpuff US non-responsive type (AUSnonresponsive type, n=45) (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The US-evoked responses of individual neurons are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary table 2. Note that this classification was different from that based on the response to 100% airpuff CS. In the following, we will focus on the AUS-inhibited and AUS-excited type neurons (see Supplementary Fig. 6 and 7 for AUS-nonresponsive type, see also Supplementary note C and Supplementary table 4 for the electrophysiological properties of each type). The averaged responses to the reward and airpuff are shown for the AUS-inhibited type neurons (Fig. 3b and c ) and AUS-excited type neurons (Fig. 3f and g ). In both types, the excitatory response to reward disappeared when the reward was completely predictable by following 100% reward CS, and decreased when the reward was partially predictable by following 50% reward CS (Fig. 3b and f ). This is consistent with the reward prediction error hypothesis that the activity of dopamine neurons represents a difference between the expected and actual values of reward 14, 15 . The AUS-inhibited type neurons appeared to encode prediction error even for aversive outcomes, albeit partially, because it was inhibited by an unexpected aversive airpuff (free airpuff) (Fig. 3c ) and this inhibitory response decreased monotonically as the airpuff was more predictable (Fig. 3d , see Supplementary note D and Supplementary Fig. 8a for individual neurons). Interestingly, the excitatory response of the AUS-excited type neurons to the airpuff also decreased as the airpuff was more predictable (Fig. 3g and h , see Supplementary note D and Supplementary Fig. 8b for individual neurons). The prediction error hypothesis predicts that neurons should respond in opposite directions when an outcome is unexpectedly omitted, compared to when the same outcome is unexpectedly delivered 14, 15 . We found that AUS-inhibited type neurons, but not AUS-excited type neurons, tended to show the responses to both reward omission and airpuff omission (Supplementary note E and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). The current consensus that dopamine neurons carry reward-related information is thought to be applied to all dopamine neurons located in the midbrain, including both the SNc and the VTA 1 . Since we have found different types of dopamine neurons with regard to their responses to aversive events, we now ask whether they were located in different regions in the midbrain. Figure 4a shows the recording sites of the 68 dopamine neurons in monkey N in relation to the response to 100% airpuff CS. Neurons showing a significant excitation (i.e., ACS-excited type neurons, red circles) tended to be located in the more dorsolateral part, and neurons showing a significant inhibition (i.e., ACS-inhibited type neurons, blue circles) tended to be located in the more ventromedial part. To statistically test this trend, we examined the relation between the recording depth and the response to 100% airpuff CS for monkey N (Fig. 4b ) and monkey D (Fig. 4c ). As shown by the scatter plots, a significant negative correlation was found for both monkeys (monkey N, r = -0.50, P < 0.01; monkey D, r = -0.57, P < 0.01). This negative correlation confirmed the dorsolateral-ventromedial differentiation of the airpuff-predicting CS evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses among dopamine neurons. Similar location differences were found in relation to response to airpuff itself (Supplementary note F and Supplementary Fig. 10 ). It has generally been assumed that midbrain dopamine neurons form a unified functional group, all representing reward-related signals in a similar manner 1 . Our results are roughly consistent with this idea as far as the reward-related signals are concerned. However, clear heterogeneity was revealed when we examined their responses to aversive events. We found two types of dopamine neurons, one inhibited and the other excited by airpuff or its predictor. Clearly, the unified concept of dopamine neurons needs to be changed (see Supplementary note G for the relationship between our findings and previous studies). We propose that there are at least two functional groups of dopamine neurons. Dopamine neurons in the first group (airpuff-inhibited type, i.e., ACS-and AUS-inhibited types) would represent motivational value. Their responses covaried with prediction errors associated with both reward and airpuff, and therefore would be useful in learning to approach rewards and avoid aversive stimuli. The function of the second group (airpuff-excited type, i.e., ACS-and AUS-excited types) is not immediately clear, but we found that their response to the CS was correlated with the latency of the monkey's orienting response (gaze shift) to the CS and that this correlation appeared only after the CS was paired with reward or airpuff (Supplementary note H and Supplementary Fig. 11 ). These results raise the possibility that the CS-evoked responses of the airpuff-excited dopamine neurons reflect the motivational salience of the CS. However, this interpretation may not be valid for the US or US omission responses of these neurons. Importantly, the two types of dopamine neurons were distributed differently, the airpuffexcited type in the dorsolateral region in the SNc, and the airpuff-inhibited type in the ventromedial region in the SNc as well as the VTA (see Supplementary note I for details). In monkeys 16 as well as rats 17 , dopamine neurons in the dorsolateral SNc project mainly to the dorsal striatum, while those in the ventromedial SNc and VTA project mainly to the ventral striatum. The airpuff-inhibited dopamine neurons in the ventromedial region in the SNc and VTA may thus transmit value-related information to the ventral striatum which is known to represent reward values [18] [19] [20] . On the other hand, the airpuff-excited dopamine neurons in the dorsolateral region in the SNc would respond to motivationally salient stimuli, whether they are appetitive or aversive, and send the signal to the dorsal striatum which is related to orienting behavior [21] [22] [23] . This may be part of the mechanism with which orienting behavior such as saccadic eye movement is induced by motivationally salient stimuli 24 . The two types of dopamine neurons may receive inputs from different sources. The airpuffexcited dopamine neurons may receive inputs from areas such as the basal forebrain in which neurons also show excitatory responses to both appetitive and aversive events 25, 26 (see Supplementary note J for further discussion). On the other hand, the airpuff-inhibited dopamine neurons may receive inputs, at least partially, from the lateral habenula. Using the same Pavlovian procedure, we have shown that lateral habenula neurons are excited by the airpuffpredicting CS and inhibited by the reward-predicting CS, indicating that they encode motivational value similarly to the airpuff-inhibited dopamine neurons, but in the opposite manner 27 . The value signals in the lateral habenula would then be transmitted to the dopamine neurons by inhibiting them 28 and this effect was stronger on dopamine neurons located in the ventromedial SNc or the VTA where the airpuff-inhibited type dominates (Supplementary note K and Supplementary Fig. 12 ). We so far have classified dopamine neurons into two types. However, the real picture is more complex. First, the difference between the two types was gradual, not distinct, so that there was another group of dopamine neurons that did not belong to any of these types (i.e., airpuff-nonresponsive type). Second, the classification was different for CSs and USs (Supplementary note L, Supplementary table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 13b ). More neurons were excited by the airpuff-predicting CS, whereas more neurons were inhibited by the airpuff itself. This might indicate flexible operations of the dopamine system. If a salient stimulus (i.e., CS) is presented, it would be beneficial to orient attention to the stimulus and judge if it predicts a rewarding event or an aversive event. This is the time when a majority of dopamine neurons are excited, thus promoting the orienting behavior. If an aversive event (i.e., US) occurs, it would be crucial to learn to avoid the action that led to the aversive event. This is the time when a majority of dopamine neurons are inhibited, thus promoting avoidance learning. METHODS SUMMARY Two adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used for the experiments. All procedures for animal care and experimentation were approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the Public Health Service Policy on the humane care and use of laboratory animals. A plastic head holder and plastic recording chamber were fixed to the skull under general anesthesia and sterile surgical conditions. The recording chamber was placed over the fronto-parietal cortex, tilted laterally by 35 degrees, and was aimed at the SNc and VTA. Two search coils were surgically placed under the conjunctiva of the eyes. The head holder, the recording chamber and the eye coil connectors were all embedded in dental acrylic that covered the top of the skull and were connected to the skull by acrylic screws. We conditioned two monkeys using a Pavlovian procedure with an appetitive US (liquid reward) and an aversive US (airpuff). During the Pavlovian procedure, we recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in and around the SNc and VTA. We estimated the position of the SNc and VTA by MRI and identified dopamine neurons by their electrophysiological properties. After the end of recording sessions in one monkey, we confirmed the recording sites histologically. We analyzed anticipatory licking, anticipatory blinking and neuronal responses during the Pavlovian procedure. We focused on three kinds of neuronal responses: 1) responses elicited by CS presentation, 2) responses elicited by US delivery, and 3) responses elicited by US omission. Details of the Pavlovian procedure, identification of dopamine neurons, analysis methods, and histological procedure can be found in Full Methods. METHODS Pavlovian procedure Our Pavlovian procedure consisted of two blocks of trials, an appetitive block (Fig. 1a ) and an aversive block (Fig. 1b ). In the appetitive block, three conditioned stimuli (CSs) (red circle, green cross and blue square for monkey N; yellow ring, cyan triangle and blue square for monkey D) were associated with a liquid reward (apple juice) as an unconditioned stimulus (US) with 100%, 50% and 0% probability, respectively. In the aversive block, three CSs (yellow ring, cyan triangle and blue square for monkey N; red circle, green cross and blue square for monkey D) were associated with an airpuff directed at the monkey's face as an US with 100%, 50% and 0% probability, respectively. The liquid reward was delivered through a spout which was positioned in front of the monkey's mouth. The airpuff (20 -30 psi) was delivered through a narrow tube placed 6 -7 cm from the face. Each trial started after the presentation of a timing cue for both blocks. The monkeys were not required to fixate the timing cue. After 1 s, the timing cue disappeared and one of the three CSs was presented pseudorandomly. After 1.5 s, the CS disappeared and the US was delivered. In addition to the cued trials, uncued trials were included in which a reward alone (free reward) was delivered during the appetitive block and an airpuff alone (free airpuff) was delivered during the aversive block. All trials were presented with a random inter-trial-interval (ITI) that averaged 5 s (3 -7 s) for monkey N and 4.5 s (3 -6 s) for monkey D. One block consisted of 42 trials with fixed proportions of trial types (100%: 12 trials, 50 %: 12 trials, 0 %: 12 trials, uncued: 6 trials). For 50 % trials, the CS was followed by the US on 6 trials and was not followed by the US on the other 6 trials. The block changed without any external cue. For each neuron we collected data by repeating the appetitive and aversive blocks twice or more. We monitored licking and blinking of the monkeys. To monitor licking, we attached a strain gage to the reward spout, and measured strains of the spout by licking. To monitor blinking, a magnetic search coil technique was used. A small Teflon-coated stainless steel wire (< 5 mm diameter, 5 or 6 turns) was taped to an eyelid. Eye closure was identified by the vertical component of the eyelid coil signal. Identification of dopamine neurons We searched for dopamine neurons in and around the SNc and VTA. Dopamine neurons were identified by their irregular firing, tonic baseline activity around 5 spikes/s, broad spike potential and phasic excitation to free reward. Data analysis We analyzed anticipatory licking, anticipatory blinking and neuronal activity during the Pavlovian procedure. To evaluate the frequency and strength of anticipatory licking, the strain gage signal was used. We first calculated the velocity of the strain of the spout. Then we integrated the absolute velocity during CS presentation for each trial. This integrated velocity becomes larger if the monkeys more frequently and strongly lick the spout. We defined this value as the magnitude of anticipatory licking in the trial. The magnitude was normalized by the following formula, normalized magnitude = (X -Min) / (Max -Min), where X is the magnitude of anticipatory licking in the trial, Max is the maximum magnitude in the recording session, and Min is the minimum magnitude in the recording session. To count the number of anticipatory blinks during CS presentation, the vertical component of the eyelid signal was used. We first calculated the downward velocity of eyelid movement. We set a threshold and counted how many times the velocity crossed the threshold during CS presentation for each trial. This count was defined as the number of anticipatory blinks in the trial. In analyses of neuronal activity, responses to each CS were defined as the discharge rate during 150-325 ms after CS onset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before CS onset. Response to reward was defined as the discharge rate during 200-400 ms after reward onset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before reward onset. Response to airpuff was defined as the discharge rate during 50-200 ms after airpuff onset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before airpuff onset. Response to reward omission was defined as the discharge rate during 200-500 ms after CS offset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before CS offset. Response to airpuff omission was defined as the discharge rate during 150-350 ms after CS offset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before CS offset. These time windows were determined based on the averaged activity of dopamine neurons. Specifically, we set the time windows such that they include major parts of the excitatory and inhibitory responses. Because the 0% reward and 0% airpuff CSs were physically identical, they could only be distinguished by the block context (appetitive block or aversive block). Therefore, to analyze responses to 0% reward and 0% airpuff CSs, we excluded all 0% reward and 0% airpuff CSs that were presented before the block context could be known, that is, before the block's first presentation of 100% CS, 50% CS or free outcome. We characterized the electrophysiological properties of recorded neurons by (1) baseline firing rate, (2) irregularity of firing pattern, (3) spike wave form. Baseline firing rate is the mean firing rate during the 250ms before the onset of the timing cue. To quantify irregularity of firing pattern, we used an irregularity metric introduced by Davies et al. 29 which they called "IR". First, interspike interval (ISI) was computed for each "between-spikes." If spike i-1 , spike i , and spike i+1 occurred in this order, the duration between spike i-1 and spike i correspond to ISI i ; the duration between spike i and spike i+1 correspond to ISI i+1 . Second, the difference between adjacent ISIs was computed as |log(ISI i / ISI i+1 )|. The value was then assigned to the timing when the spikei occurred. Thus, small IR values indicate regular firing and large IR values indicate irregular firing. We then computed a median of all IR values during ITI (during the 1000ms before timing cue onset). To quantify spike wave form, we measured the spike duration of 67 dopamine neurons (whose spike wave forms were successfully recorded). The typical spike consisted of the following waves: first, sharp negative; second, sharp positive; third, slow negative; fourth, slow positive. We measured the spike duration from the peak of the first wave (sharp negative) to the peak of the third wave (slow negative). Histology After the end of the recording session in monkey N, we selected representative locations for electrode penetrations. When typical dopamine activity was recorded, we made electrolytic microlesions at the recording sites (12 µA and 30 s). Then, monkey N was deeply anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium, and perfused with 10 % formaldehyde. The brain was blocked and equilibrated with 10 % sucrose. Frozen sections were cut every 50 µm in coronal plane. The sections were stained with cresyl violet. a, Appetitive block. Three conditioned stimuli (CSs) were associated with apple juice with 100%, 50% and 0% probability, respectively. b, Aversive block. Three CSs were associated with aversive airpuff with 100%, 50% and 0% probability, respectively. In both blocks, each trial started after the presentation of a timing cue (central small spot) on the screen. After 1 s, the timing cue disappeared and one of the three CSs was presented. After 1.5 s, the CS disappeared and the US (reward or airpuff) was delivered. In addition to the cued trials, uncued trials were included in which a reward alone (free reward) was delivered during the appetitive block and an airpuff alone (free airpuff) was delivered during the aversive block. c, Average of normalized magnitude of anticipatory licking during the presentation of reward CSs for monkey D (solid line) and monkey N (dashed line). d, Average of number of anticipatory blinks during the presentation of the airpuff CSs for monkey D (solid line) and monkey N (dashed line).

response modifying odours offer powerful instruments for developing new generations of insect repellents and lures, which even in small quantities can interfere with the ability of mosquitoes to seek humans. Text Each year A. gambiae, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes transmit deadly diseases such as malaria and dengue to >half a billion people and cause millions of deaths. Female mosquitoes need to find and obtain a blood meal from an infected person and subsequently find an uninfected human-host to bite. Disruption of host-seeking in mosquitoes could therefore reduce incidence of both steps. Female mosquitoes depend primarily on olfactory cues that are emitted from human breath, skin and sweat to find hosts 3 . Yet very few strategies that target the mosquito olfactory system, like the effective repellent DEET (N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide) 4, 5 , have emerged. However, the relatively high cost of DEET, and need for repeated application to the skin at high concentrations (10-70%) precludes its use in tropical countries. DEET is also known to melt plastics 6 , and to block cation channels 4 and cholinesterase activity in mammals 7 ..Moreover, DEET resistance has been observed in Drosophila melanogaster 8 Anopheles albimanus 9 and A. aegypti 10 , which reiterates a need to identify additional classes of repellents. An ideal target for disrupting host-seeking is the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) detection machinery. CO 2 exhaled by humans is a vital cue for mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes are exquisitely sensitive to minute changes in CO 2 concentration 11 , which they potentially sense from long distances 1, 12 . Upon encountering a plume of CO 2 , a female mosquito orients upwind using optomotor anemotaxis, while maintaining contact with the host-odour plume 13 . Remarkably, CO 2 exposure also increases the sensitivity of A. aegypti to human skin odours 2 . CO 2 is detected by heteromeric receptor proteins that are highly conserved across dipterans including the three vector mosquitoes studied here and Drosophila 14 (Supplemental Figure 1a, b ), and are expressed in a dedicated labelled-line CO 2 -detection circuit [15] [16] [17] [18] . This circuit provides means to disrupt key aspects of host-seeking behaviour in multiple species. Previously we identified odorants that inhibit electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO 2 in D. melanogaster, two of which also inhibited the CO 2 response in C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes 19 . To identify more effective and across-species inhibitors of the conserved CO 2 receptors 14 , we screened a panel of compounds structurally related to the known inhibitors using singlesensillum electrophysiology on A. gambiae, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus females, and identified several efficient inhibitors for each (Figure 1a ). The effects of some compounds were conserved across 250 MY of evolution 20 while others were species-specific. Subtle changes in structure influenced the strength of inhibition (Figure 1a ), but volatility or solubility did not appear to be as important (Supplemental Figure 2 ). Inhibition was dosedependent (Figure 1b, c ) and the temporal dynamics of inhibition were odour-dependent (Supplemental Figure 1b ). Most trapping devices use CO 2 to attract mosquitoes. Unfortunately, these are rarely used for surveillance or control in tropical countries because of high costs and difficulties in supplying CO 2 via gas cylinders, dry ice, or propane combustion. Using a parallel electrophysiology screen we identified 2-butanone as a dose-dependent activator of the cpA neuron in all three mosquito species (Supplemental Figure 3a, b ). Repeated stimuli of 2butanone showed a temporal pattern of cpA neuron activation indistinguishable from that elicited by CO 2 (Figure 1d, e ). Such odours that mimic CO 2 activity, are ideal candidates for formulating convenient, compact, and economical lures for use in trap-based mosquito control in developing countries. In the electrophysiology screen we also identified an additional structurally related odourant, 2,3-butanedione, which activates the cpA neuron in the three mosquito species (Supplemental Figure 4a ). 2,3-butanedione exhibits an unusual property: exposure to a brief 1-sec pulse results in ultra-prolonged activation of the cpA neuron (Figure 1f, g, h ). The activity of the cpA neuron remained high for the entire 5 ½-minute recording period. In contrast, response to a comparable CO 2 stimulus rapidly decays immediately after the end of stimulus (Figure 1g, h ). Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that express Or genes rarely show this property and rapidly adapt in the first second upon stimulus exposure, even with a continuous stimulus 21 . Not much has been reported quantitatively on temporal response termination kinetics for single odorants beyond two seconds post stimulus 22 . An individual neuron trace of a moth to a plant volatile suggests activation beyond the stimulus period 23 . In another example an ORN of a male moth showed activity for >10 minutes following a 1sec pulse of a pheromone analog, but only with an increase of ∼3 spikes/sec 24 . Most importantly, the brief 2,3-butanedione exposure evoked such a strong prolonged response in cpA neurons of A. gambiae and A. aegypti that responses to subsequent CO 2 stimuli during the 5.5-min recordings were severely reduced, displaying little activation above the high baseline firing of the neuron (Figure 2a, b ). This property is neither enhanced nor reversed efficiently by a subsequent intervening stimulus of another activator, or inhibitors (Supplemental Figure 4b, c ) suggesting that an active state, perhaps of the receptor, G-protein signalling 25 , or OBP may be stabilized by 2,3-butanedione. To find more effective long-term maskers we tested multiple combinations of CO 2 responsemodifying odours and identified a blend of four odourants, 2,3-butanedione, 1-hexanol, 1butanal and 1-pentanal, which is effective at a 10-fold lower dilution (10 -2 ). This blend caused prolonged activation and rendered the A. aegypti cpA neuron unresponsive to CO 2 stimuli throughout the 5.5 minute duration of the assay (Figure 2c , Supplemental Figure 4d, e, 5 ). The effect of the "ultra-prolonged" odour(s) is specific to the CO 2 -sensitive cpA neuron since the response of a neighbouring neuron, with a smaller spike amplitude to 1octen-3-ol, was not affected (Figure 2 d, e ). The same "ultra-prolonged" activating blend was also highly effective on the C. quinquefasciatus cpA neuron (Figure 2f ). Aedes females show rapid (<200msec) and robust responses to entering (turn upwind) and exiting (turn crosswind) a plume of CO 2 , both important for source finding 2 . In fact the cpA-neuron displays an exquisite temporal resolution of the presence or absence of abovebaseline concentrations of CO 2 18 (Figure 1d ) as required for a system whose sensory input plays a key role in the control of flight behaviour. This form of rapid odour-evoked flight modulation (turning and surging) in insects 26, 27 involves both odour detection and discrimination dependent upon moment-to-moment changes in olfactory neuron activity 27 . Higher order projection neuron circuits are also particularly sensitive to the onset of odour stimuli 28 . Thus, an "ultra-prolonged activator" that compromises the ability of the sensory neuron to detect rapid changes in CO 2 concentration could disrupt CO 2 -mediated attraction behaviour very effectively. To test the effect of ultra-prolonged activators on behavioural attraction to CO 2 , mated A. aegypti females were pre-treated with odourant(s) vapours and tested in a wind tunnel (Figure 3a, b ). Mock-treated A. aegypti females that were pre-exposed to solvent alone all left the holding cage, crossed the half-way point of the tunnel (Figure 3c ) and navigated successfully along a turbulent CO 2 plume and flew through the CO 2 -emitting ring (Figure 3d ). In contrast, females pre-exposed to the "ultra-prolonged" odour blend were impaired in their ability to fly upwind (Figure 3c ) as well as in finding the CO 2 source, in a dose and time-dependent manner (Figure 3d ,e,f, Supplemental Videos 1-3). After pre-treatment with the odour blend for 1-min, not only did fewer mosquitoes reach the source (Figure 3g ,h), they also took longer to get there (Supplemental Figure 6a, b, c ). The proportion of pre-treated mosquitoes that reached the CO 2 source increased as the assay progressed through 5 minutes (Figure 3g ,h), suggesting that their ability to detect CO 2 somewhat improves with time. Pre-exposure to 2,3-butanedione caused more pronounced behavioural defects in CO 2 attraction than other components of the blend (Figure 3i ). We determined the specificity of the effect of the odour blend by examining its effect on a different odour-mediated behaviour, and found that avoidance to DEET in a non-contact repellency chamber 29 was not reduced by pre-exposure to this blend (Figure 3j , Supplemental Figure 7 ). This result also suggests that, if desired, a long-range CO 2 -masking strategy might be used effectively in combination with short-range repellency to DEET. We then tested for disruption of mosquito hut-entry behaviour in a semi-field environment in Kenya 30 . Host-seeking C. quinquefasciatus females were released overnight in a large enclosed greenhouse that contained two faux huts with CO 2 -emitting counter-flow geometry traps placed in each of them; females were attracted by the traps and entered the huts through the eaves, and a large majority were then trapped (Figure 4a , Supplemental Figure 8 ). Inclusion of a source of the "ultra-prolonged" activating blend at 1% (dissolved in paraffin oil) in the form of small fan-driven odour dispensers (Figure 4b , Supplemental Figure 8 ) resulted in a significant reduction in the number of females that entered the CO 2trap in the treated hut. Moreover, the total number of mosquitoes entering the treated hut but not trapped was also significantly lower than in the control hut, both indicating that "ultra prolonged activators" masked CO 2 -mediated attraction to the hut (Figure 4b, c ). Additionally, odour treatment in one hut did not lead to an increase in the number of mosquitoes entering the control hut (44.25 mosquitoes/night), compared to numbers entering a similarly CO 2 -baited hut (56 mosquitoes/night) when odour-treatment was not applied to either hut. In a separate greenhouse experiment, mosquitoes were given unrestricted access to a CO 2baited trap in a hut through open door, window and eaves (Figure 4d ). There was a significant reduction in capture of female C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in the trap when the "ultra-prolonged" activating blend (3% in paraffin oil) was also continuously dispensed inside the hut (Figure 4e ) as compared to control experiments in the untreated hut. Thus, the odorant blend reduced the number of female mosquitoes inside a hut in both 2-choice and 1choice semi-field behaviour assays (Figure 4f ). Taken together, we show that several aspects of CO 2 -mediated behaviour, including activation of upwind flight and navigation towards the CO 2 source, are severely reduced when detection of CO 2 by the cpA neuron is disrupted by exposure to an "ultra-prolonged" activating blend at concentrations as low as 0.1%. Importantly, the "ultra-prolonged" blend is absent from the behaviour arena in the wind-tunnel assays. This implies that the reduced attraction towards the CO 2 source cannot be attributed to detection of blend-components via other ORNs but is due to the inability of the cpA neurons in pre-treated mosquitoes to detect the CO 2 source. To test whether an "ultra-prolonged" activator like 2,3-butanedione can become attractive at lower concentrations (10 -3 and 10 -4 ), we tested it overnight as an evaporating lure in a counterflow-geometry trap for Culex females in a large enclosed arena in California as well as on female Aedes mosquitoes for attraction towards a turbulent plume of 2,3-butanedione at 10 -3 in a wind tunnel. Lower concentrations of the ultra-prolonged activator did not act as an attractive cue for mosquitoes in either assay (Supplemental Table 1 ). In summary we describe a novel coding mechanism where "ultra-prolonged" activation of a sensory neuron modifies its ability to detect and transmit information about changes in concentrations of its ligands in the environment. Along with this class of ligands we have also identified inhibitors and activators of the mosquito CO 2 neurons (Figure 4g ). Several characteristics of these novel classes of volatile chemicals offer powerful advantages as potential tools for reducing mosquito-human contact. First, volatile odorants that mask or repel mosquitoes at low concentrations, and that can be easily dispersed in the air, may protect several individuals within a large area. Second, area masking agents and repellents may be effective without application on skin, and thus the convenience may lead to widespread adoption in developing countries. Third, the use of multiple-odour blends to modify behaviour might delay the emergence of resistant strains, a common concern with other methods of mosquito control. Compounds reported in this initial proof-of-principle investigation such as 2,3-butanedione have undesirable safety profiles at high concentrations and are not ideal for human use without further testing. However the structures of the agonists and antagonists we have described in this study have enabled us to identify important structural features and pharmacophores (Supplemental Figure 9 ) that provide a rational foundation to find additional odorants with improved efficacy and safety profiles. Identification of such molecules is of extremely high priority, which may be effective at lower concentrations, is environmentally friendly, economical and useful in preventing mosquito borne diseases. Methods Summary Electrophysiology Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed as described previously 19 with few modifications noted in Full Methods section. Odour delivery system was specifically designed to ensure steady levels of CO 2 concentration as described previously 19 and minimize changes in airflow over insect preparation during single-odour stimulus by switching stimulus airflow from a blank delivery cartridge to an odour-laden delivery cartridge. Behaviour Wind-tunnel behaviour experiments were performed as described previously 2 with some modifications. Avoidance assays with 9.8% DEET were performed in the dark using a repellency chamber which was designed as in 29 with some modifications. Briefly, 20 female A. aegypti mosquitoes between 1-2 weeks of age were released inside the repellency chamber and allowed 5 minutes to "escape" from a spout in response to a 9.8% DEET impregnated filter paper which was placed out of range for physical contact. Greenhouse behaviour trials were conducted in two MalariaSphere greenhouses 30 Full Methods Electrophysiology Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed as described previously 19 with few modifications. Chemicals were of the highest purity available, typically >99% (Sigma-Aldrich). Odourants were diluted in paraffin oil at indicated concentration. Unless indicated 50 μl of diluted odorant is applied/ cartridge, and each cartridge used for no more than 3 stimuli. A controlled volume of air 5 ml/sec was puffed through the odour cartridge containing vapours, and was delivered into a constant humidified airstream of 10ml/sec that flowed over the fly antenna. The odourant vapour present in the cartridge was thus diluted ∼3-fold before being passed over the fly. CO 2 stimulus was pulsed through a separate delivery system that delivered controlled pulses using a PSM 8000 microinjector (variable 2.5 ml/sec -6.5 ml/ sec) into the same humidified airstream, from either a 1% or 5% tank of CO 2 (Airgas). The baseline constant humidified airstream (10 ml/sec) was generated from a purified air tank (Airgas) and mixed with a constant controlled volume (5 ml/sec) of filtered room air (∼0.035% CO 2 ). For delivery of binary mixtures of CO 2 with another odorant, we ensured a steady concentration of CO 2 to the fly preparation as described in detail in 19 . Unless mentioned, responses were quantiӿed by subtraction of baseline activity immediately preceding stimulus application from activity during the stimulus. Odour stimuli without CO 2 was also delivered using the system described above to minimize changes in airflow over insect preparation by switching filtered room air (5 ml/sec) from a blank delivery cartridge to an odour-laden delivery cartridge for indicated duration using the CS-55 stimulus delivery system (Syntech). For each odorant or blend that had a long-term effect on CO 2 response, each recording was obtained from a naive insect. Behaviour in wind tunnel Wind-tunnel behaviour experiments were performed as described previously 2 with some modifications. Briefly, female mated non-blood fed A. aegypti mosquitoes between 7-14 days of age raised in a 14:10 hour light-dark cycle were individually collected in release cages and held for 21 hours at 25°C and 70% relative humidity. Mosquitoes in the cage were then transferred into an upended 1 L glass beaker with 100 μL of odour diluted in paraffin oil at the indicated concentration. The mosquito in the release cage was removed from the odour and beaker and transferred in room air across the room to the wind tunnel (within ∼15 sec) where it was carefully manipulated into the release cage. Air from outside the building was presented in the wind tunnel in a laminar flow at a controlled rate of 30 cm 3 /sec, at ∼70% relative humidity, temperature ∼23°C. A turbulent plume of 1% CO 2 was generated by mixing purified CO 2 and air from cylinders (Airgas) and delivered through a glass ring with 8 outlets pointing inwards. The cage was opened remotely to release an individual female mosquito. Two video cameras were used to record the flight path. Analyses of videos were performed on computers offline. Behaviour in repellency chamber A stainless steel repellency chamber used a standard design 29 (Supplemental Figure 7 ). A stainless steel plate was added underneath the smaller screened inner cage to hold the stimulus-loaded paper thus preventing contact with mosquitoes. A blotting paper (12″×7″ inches) was impregnated with 5 ml of 9.8% DEET (Jungle Juice 98% DEET, REI diluted in acetone) and the solvent allowed to evaporate inside a fume hood for 30 mins before placement on the steel plate inside the repellency chamber. Twenty female A. aegypti between 1-2 weeks old were transferred to a release cage 30-mins prior to assay start, and pre-exposed to odourant blend exactly as described previously right before start of assay. Mosquitoes were released inside the inner chamber from the release cage and the lights turned off, and the number of mosquitoes escaping from the exit spout at the end of 5 mins counted. Equipment was cleaned with acetone or ethanol and dried to avoid contamination. Two-Choice Behaviour in MalariaSphere Experiments were conducted at the Thomas Odhiambo Field Station of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Mbita Point, western Kenya in late April to June. Culex quinquefasciatus were obtained from the existing rabbit-blood fed colonies at the station insectary. At 18:00 hours 100 female and 20 male Culex were released remotely for every experiment from the centre of a large glass-covered MalariaSphere and allowed to enter either of two huts on two sides until 07:00 (Figure 4a ), each running one CO 2 -baited (250ml/min) counterflow geometry trap (Supplemental Figure 8 ). Each hut also ran two TimeMist® Fan dispensers starting 30-mins prior to mosquito release and run for duration of the assay, the test with a container containing 15 ml of odour (1% in paraffin oil), and the control with container of 15 ml paraffin oil. The huts were fitted with one-way entry ports in the eaves as the only mosquito entry points in order to enable us to count all entering mosquitoes, with windows covered by nets and doors closed. Additionally, huts were lined with clean black cotton sheets that could be removed and washed to reduce odour contamination between trials. Treatment huts and trap positions were randomized. At end of trial mosquitoes were counted in each trap and inside each hut. Additional non-participating mosquitoes inside the MalariaSphere were removed. One-Choice Behaviour in MalariaSphere A smaller single-hut net-covered MalariaSphere (Figure 4d ) was used. At 18:00 hours, 100 female and 20 male Culex mosquitoes were released inside the MalariaSphere and allowed to enter the hut freely through open eaves, door and window. A CO 2 -baited (250ml/min) counterflow geometry trap was started at 18:00 inside the hut and trapped mosquitoes were counted at 07:00. One TimeMist® Fan dispenser ran continuously during the 4-day duration of the 4 overnight trials with a container containing 15 ml of odour (3%) /paraffin oil which was replaced every 24 hours. Because we observed possible long-term contamination effects in thatched roofs and netting in pilot experiments, the no-odour controls were run before odour-treatment to avoid contamination. Untrapped mosquitoes were not removed from the MalariaSphere and their approximate numbers taken into account while calculating percentage caught for each night. Trapping Responses in Greenhouse A greenhouse at the Agricultural research station of UC Riverside (California) was modified to enclose a 3 × 6m area in netting where 50 laboratory reared female Culex quinquifasciatus were released each evening and counterflow geometry traps were run from 17:00 to 09:00. CO 2 was dispensed as described before. Odourants were dissolved in paraffin oil and dispensed from a 50 ml uncapped tube containing 6 perforations and two 15 cm nylon wicks, which were attached to the air flow outlet tube of the trap. The odorant had largely evaporated from the container at the end of each trial as observed from a sniff test and from change in colour of solution from light yellow to transparent. applied on cotton-wool in cartridge, is overlaid on a 3-sec stimulus of 0.15% CO 2 . n=3.

stimulation, and calcium imaging of local neuronal activity. dLight1 enabled chronic tracking of learning-induced changes in millisecond dopamine transients in striatum. Further, we used dLight1 to image spatially distinct, functionally heterogeneous dopamine transients relevant to learning and motor control in cortex. We also validated our sensor design platform for developing norepinephrine, serotonin, melatonin, and opioid neuropeptide indicators. Animal behavior is influenced by the release of neuromodulators, such as dopamine (DA), which signal behavioral variables that are relevant to the functioning of circuits brainwide. Projections from dopaminergic nuclei to the striatum and cortex, for example, play important roles in reinforcement learning, decision-making and motor control. Loss of DA or dysfunction of its target circuits has been linked to disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and addiction (1) (2) (3) . Much work has been devoted to determining how neural representations of behavioral states are encoded in the firing patterns of neuromodulatory neurons (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) , but very little is known about how the precise release of neuromodulators alters the function of their target circuits (10, 11) . To address this problem, one essential step is to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuromodulatory signals in target circuits, while also measuring and manipulating the elements of the circuit during behavior. Analytical techniques such as microdialysis and electrochemical micro-sensors, have provided useful insights about neuromodulator presence (12, 13) , but suffer from poor spatial and/or temporal resolution, and cannot be targeted to cells of interest. Optical approaches, such as injected cell-based systems (CNiFERs) (14) and reporter gene-based iTango (15) can reveal dopamine release with high molecular specificity. However, these systems are limited by poor temporal resolution (seconds to hours), preventing direct detection of DA release events that occur on a sub-second time scale (16, 17) . High-quality single fluorescence protein (FP)-based sensors that report calcium or glutamate transients with subsecond temporal resolution have recently been developed and are widely used (18, 19) . Here we report the development of a set of single-FP-based dopamine sensors, named dLight1, that enables imaging of DA transients with high spatiotemporal resolution in behaving animals. Sensor engineering Sensitive optical readout of changes in DA concentration was achieved by directly coupling the DA-binding-induced conformational changes in human DA receptors to changes in the fluorescence intensity of circularly permuted (cp) GFP. We did this by replacing the third intracellular loop (IL3) of the human Dopamine D1 (DRD1), D2 (DRD2) and D4 receptors (DRD4) with a cpGFP module from GCaMP6 (Fig. 1A ). To determine the insertion site of cpGFP in IL3 that produces maximal coupling of ligandinduced conformational changes to cpGFP fluorescence, we aligned the sequences of DRD1 and DRD4 with that of β 2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) (Fig. 1B ), for which both active and inactive structure are available (20) . The initial variant, obtained by inserting a cpGFP module (LSSLE-cpGFP-LPDQL) between K232 and K269 of DRD1, was well-expressed at the plasma membrane of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and showed a fluorescence decrease (ΔF/F max = -19.4 ± 0.02 %) in response to puffed DA (fig. S1A ). To obtain a positive-response sensor, we screened a library of 585 variants in HEK cells (Fig. 1C and fig. S1B ). The variant with the largest positive fluorescence response (max ΔF/F max = 230 ± 9 %) and excellent membrane localization was named dLight1.1 (Fig. 1D ). In situ DA titration on HEK cells revealed sub-micromolar apparent affinity of dLight1.1 (330 ± 30 nM, Fig 1E ). We next sought to further tune the dynamic range and affinity of the sensor. Mutation of Phe129, a highly conserved residue among many GPCRs (21) , into alanine (dLight1.2) slightly increased dynamic range (max ΔF/F max = 340 ± 20%, apparent affinity: 770 ± 10 nM, Fig. 1D and E ). Optimizing the cpGFP insertion site in dLight1.1 and dLight1.2 (fig. S1C to G) greatly increased the dynamic range, but also reduced the affinity to micromolar range (dLight1.3a: ΔF/F max = 660 ± 30 %, apparent affinity: 2300 ± 20 nM, fig S2A and B; dLight1.3b: ΔF/F max = 930 ± 30 %, apparent affinity: 1680± 10 nM, Fig. 1D and E ). Insertion of the cpGFP module into DRD4 and DRD2 respectively produced dLight1.4 and dLight1.5 respectively, which exhibited nanomolar affinity with a relatively small dynamic range (dLight 1.4: ΔF/F max = 170 ± 10 %, apparent affinity: 4.1 ± 0.2 nM, Fig. 1B, D and E ; dLight1.5: ΔF/F max to DA= 180 ± 10 %, apparent affinity to DA: 110 ± 10 nM, and ΔF/F max to Quinpirole= 124 ± 19%, fig S2A to C). In addition, we engineered a control sensor by incorporating a D103A mutation in dLight1.1 to abolish DA binding (ΔF/F= 0.4 ± 4 %, Fig. 1E ) (22) . Because dLight1.1 and dLight1.2 produced large responses at low DA concentration (e.g.100 nM) without approaching response saturation (Fig. 1E inset) and had submicromolar affinity, we further characterized these two sensors. Sensor characterization These two sensors showed peak emissions at 516 nm and 920 nm for one-and two-photon illumination in HEK cells, respectively (fig. S3 ). In situ titration on dissociated hippocampal neurons showed similar apparent affinities to DA as on HEK293 cells (fig. S4A to C, Fig  1E ). Single pulses (5ms) of uncaged dopamine were robustly detected on the dendrites of cultured neurons, and the fluorescence response tracked uncaging pulse duration (fig. S4D to  F ). In cultured hippocampal slices, dLight1 could reliably detect sub-micromolar DA concentration changes at dendrites and single dendritic spines (fig. S4G to I ). We then investigated the endogenous and pharmacological molecular specificity of the sensor. dLight1 was ~70 and ~40 times less sensitive to norepinephrine and epinephrine than to DA; negligible responses were observed to all other neuromodulators tested (fig. S5 ). The amplitude of the response to each pharmacological compound reflected the efficacy of drugs on the wild-type receptors, with the largest response to the full-agonist, dihydrexidine (ΔF/F= 300 ± 10%), followed by partial agonists (Fig. 1F ). The response to DA was abolished in the presence of the DRD1 antagonists SKF-83566 and SCH-233990, but was unaffected by the DRD2 antagonists haloperidol and sulpiride (Fig. 1F ). To investigate the possible interference of sensor expression with G-protein signaling, we first measured the effect of sensor expression on the ligand-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) response (fig. S6 ) (23) . Transiently transfected dLight1.1 and dLight1.2 triggered no significant cAMP response in HEK cells, similar to the negative control (EGFP); whereas wild-type DRD1 did (**p<0.01; ***p<0.001, fig. S6A ). The conversion of DRD1 to a fluorescent sensor thus apparently blocked the scaffold's ability to bind G-protein and trigger the signaling cascade. When introduced into a cell line that endogenously expressed DRD1 (U2OS), dLight1 did not significantly alter the dose-response curve to DA (p=0.96, fig. S6B ). dLight1 was also defective in agonist-induced internalization, a readout of DRD1 engagement of β-arrestin (24) , when compared to wild type DRD1(**p<0.01, fig. S6C ). Total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) imaging verified that dLight1 remained diffusely distributed in the plasma membrane, without any detectable internalization, during a complete cycle of ligand-dependent fluorescence change (fig. S6 D-F ). Taken together, these results indicate that the dLight sensors are suitable for use on the cell membrane without affecting endogenous signaling through G-proteins or engagement of β-arrestins. Versatile application to other neuromodulators We next applied the design strategy of dLight1 to modularly develop a class of intensitybased sensors for various neuromodulators and neuropeptides. We selected a subset of GPCRs, including Gs-coupled β 1 and β 2 adrenergic receptors (B1AR and B2AR); Gicoupled k and μ-type opioid receptors (KOR, MOR), and α 2 adrenergic receptor (A2AR); and G q -coupled 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor-2A (5HT2A) and melatonin type-2 receptor (MT2). As with dLight1, we replaced IL3 with cpGFP, with insertion sites chosen to preserve the conserved positive charges (fig. S7A ). All sensors localized to the membrane and showed positive fluorescence responses to their respective agonists (fig. S7B ). Two-photon imaging of dopamine release in dorsal striatum ex vivo and in vivo We next used dLight1 to measure the time course and concentration of endogenous dopamine release triggered by electrical stimulation and drug modification in acute striatal slices with 2P imaging (Fig. 2A ). Two to four weeks after injection of an adeno-associated virus encoding dLight1 (AAV9.hSynapsin1.dLight1.2) into the dorsal striatum, we observed both broadly distributed and localized fluorescence transients across the field of view (Fig. 2B and C , fig. S8A to C ) in response to a single electrical stimulus. Fast line scan at these hotspots (Fig 2C ) revealed a rapid onset of fluorescence increase (rise τ 1/2 = 9.5 ± 1.1 ms) followed by a plateaued peak (averaged ΔF/F= 220 ± 50%) for about 150 ms, which decayed to baseline in about 400 ms (decay τ 1/2 = 90 ± 11ms, Fig. 2D ). We observed robust and reproducible fluorescent transients to low-frequency stimuli over a prolonged imaging period, whereas subsequent higher frequency stimuli elicited much smaller responses (p<0.0001, Fig. 2E and F ), indicating strong depression from an initially high probability of release. Blockade of dopamine reuptake with cocaine significantly prolonged the decay of fluorescence from peak to baseline (p<0.05, Fig. 2G and H ), but with equivocal effect on response amplitude (P=0.056, Fig. 2G and H ). Application of the competitive antagonist SKF83566 eliminated the responses (fig. S8F ), confirming that fluorescent signals are indeed due to DA binding. We next used dLight1 to estimate released DA concentration induced by a brief electrical stimulus. By comparison with a concentration-response curve (fig. S8D, E and G ), the fluorescence response suggested a 10-30 μM DA release (Fig. 2I ), which is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than previously reported in ventral striatum using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) (25) and is similar to that reported by measuring DRD2 activation (26) . Addition of saturating amphetamine (10 μM, in the presence of 400 μM sulpiride) increased tonic dopamine to 3.3 μM (fig. S8F and G ). We then examined the action of known modulators of dopamine release using dLight1 (Fig. 2J to L ). Activation of D2-autoreceptors with quinpirole decreased the electrically evoked fluorescence transients, which was reversed by the application of sulpiride (p<0.01, Fig. 2J ). Perfusion with a k-opioid receptor agonist (U69,593) caused a small decrease in the amplitude (P<0.05, Fig. 2J ), which was completely blocked by naloxone (Fig. 2J ). We then imaged the effects of nicotinic receptors activation in mediating the probability of dopamine release. Blockade of nicotinic receptors with hexamethonium profoundly reduced the fluorescence transient, which depended on the number of stimuli (*P<0.05, ***P<0.001, Fig. 2K, L ). In the absence of hexamethonium, the amplitude of the fluorescence remained consistent regardless of the stimulation protocol (P=0.06, Fig. 2K, L ) (27) . Next we asked whether dLight1 could reliably report dopamine signals associated with mouse locomotion in dorsal striatum, which was labeled with AAV1.hSynapsin1.dLight1.1/1.2 and AAV1.hSynapsin1.flex.tdTomato. We measured dopamine transients with 2P imaging during rest and self-initiated locomotion (fig. S9 ). Consistent with in-vivo 2P calcium imaging of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) axon terminals in dorsal striatum (10) , dLight1 reliably showed widespread and synchronous subsecond transients associated with spontaneous locomotion, which was clearly distinguishable from motion artifacts (fig. S9A to E ). The dopamine transients were rapidly and bi-directionally modulated with respect to locomotion. Accelerations were associated with an increase and decelerations with a decrease (peak mean cross-correlation 240 ms, P<0.001, fig. S9F to L ). In summary, dLight1 faithfully and directly reports the time course and concentration of local dopamine release and drug-dependent modulatory effects on dopamine release in acute striatum slice. In addition, dLight1 enables direct visualization of locomotion-triggered dopamine release in behaving mice. Deep-brain recording of DA dynamics simultaneously with optogenetics or calcium imaging The nucleus accumbens (NAc) receives projections from dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). To directly probe DA release in freely moving mice, we delivered AAV9.CAG.dLight1.1 or AAV9.CAG.control_sensor in the NAc, followed by fiber photometry imaging (Fig. 3 , fig. S10A and B ). dLight1 revealed visible spontaneous dopamine transients, which were absent in the imaging sessions using the control sensor (fig. S10C ). To optically activate VTA DAergic neurons, we infected VTA of TH::IRES-Cre mice with AAV5.hSynapsin1.flex.ChrimsonR.tdTomato (28) (Fig. 3A to C, fig. S11A and B , fig. S12A and D ). The high temporal resolution of dLight1 enabled detection of individual peaks of dopamine transients in response to 5, 10 and 20 Hz photostimulation (Fig. 3D , fig. S13A to  C ). The amplitude of fluorescence increase was correlated with the frequency of photostimulation (Fig. 3D and F ). In contrast, no fluorescence changes were observed with the control sensor using 20Hz stimuli (Fig. 3D and E ). Compared to saline-injected controls, systemic administration of SCH-23390 significantly reduced optogenetically-induced dLight1 responses, whereas the reuptake inhibitor GBR-12909 enhanced them (Fig. 3G to  H ). Next, we examined whether dLight1 can report inhibition of DA transients. To induce transient inhibition of VTA DAergic neurons, we optogenetically stimulated VTA GABAergic neurons in VGAT::IRES-Cre mice (29) (Fig. 3I ). Histology confirmed ChrimsonR expression in VTA GABAergic neurons (fig. S12B, C and E ). We observed rapid and reversible reductions in dLight1 fluorescence in response to VTA GABAergic neuron photoactivation at 40 Hz (Fig. 3J and K , fig. S13D ), indicating that dLight1 can report bidirectional changes in local DA release. Motivationally salient stimuli modify dopamine neuron firing and downstream NAc activity (9, 29, 30) . To link the DA release to local neuronal activity, we performed dual-color measurements with dLight1 and the red-shifted calcium indicator jRGECO1a (31) in lateral core/shell regions (Fig. 3L , fig. S10B , S11A and S12F). When mice voluntarily consumed reward (50 μL of 5% sucrose), we observed a concordant increase of DA concentration and local population activity (Fig. 3M, N, and S13E ), similar to a class of NAc single units showing excitation upon reward (32) . In contrast, footshocks suppressed DA release while enhancing local neuronal activity, indicating dissociation between DA dynamics and local circuit activity (Fig. 3O, P and S13F ). Chronic imaging of dopamine dynamics throughout cue-reward learning We next examined the utility of dLight1 in reporting modulation of DA signaling in response to conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli throughout Pavlovian conditioning (Fig. 4A ) (8, 33, 34) . Mice successfully learned to associate the predictive cues to the reward as shown by increasing numbers of licks during CS over the course of training, and decreasing licks during extinction learning (Fig. 4B ). Repeated fiber photometry recordings in the NAc revealed two types of DA transients modulated during associative learning: increased DA response to the predictive cues and decreased response to reward consumption across sessions. In the first session, a small and time-locked phasic DA signal was present at the CS onset, while after US the DA signal was larger and also more temporally spread (Fig. 4C and D ), consistent with US consumption onsets being highly variable at early stages (Fig. S14A and B ). Aligning to consumption onset revealed large DA signal to the US at the first session (Fig. 4C and S14A ). Upon repeated cue-reward pairings, the amplitude of CS response significantly increased (Fig 4C,  D, F, H and S14C ). On the other hand, US response, when aligned to the consumption onset, showed linear decrease across learning sessions. (Fig. 4G and H ). This suggests that DA response gradually shifted from US to CS as animals acquired cue-reward association (Fig. 4H , and S14D) (9, 33) . During extinction, we observed an attenuated phasic CS response (Fig. 4E, F and H ). The amplitude of the phasic CS response was correlated with CStriggered licking behavior during both learning and extinction sessions (Fig. S14E ), suggesting that the CS response predicted the animal's vigor to obtain reward. We further investigated whether dLight1 can report signals correlated with "reward prediction error" (RPE)(4). After the animals had fully learned CS-US association, mice underwent "unexpected reward availability" sessions (in which the US was occasionally made available without the CS) in between normal paired trials (Fig. 4I ). Unexpected reward consumption elicited significantly higher fluorescence compared to expected consumption (Fig. 4J and K ). In the "unexpected reward omission" session, where the US was occasionally omitted after the predictive CS, fluorescence decreased below the pre-CS baseline after the time at which the US would have normally become available CS presentation (Fig. 4L and M ). Cellular-level imaging of functionally-heterogeneous dopamine transients in mouse cortex Finally, we tested whether 2P imaging with dLight1 can reveal the spatiotemporal release of DA associated with reward in the cortex. The cortex receives projection axons from both SNc and VTA. Inputs from these nuclei carry distinct dopaminergic signals, influencing motor control and reward learning, respectively (10, 35) . To demonstrate the utility of dLight1 in detecting behavior-related DA signals, we broadly labeled frontal/motor cortex with AAV9.hSynapsin1.dLight1.2, followed by 2P imaging of dLight1-expressing layer 2/3 neurons in head-fixed mice. The animals had fully learned a visuomotor association task that required them to run in response to a visual "Go" cue in order to receive a water reward (Fig. 5A and B ). We observed task-related DA transients, distinguishable from motion artifacts (fig. S15 ), across cell-sized regions of interest (ROIs) across the field of view (Fig. 5C , fig. S16 ). Aligning the DA transients to trial/stand still phase onset, we found two types of task relevant DA responses during the reward expectation and reward delivery intervals. An average of 63% of responsive ROIs showed significantly increased DA transients that correlated with reward, which were abolished by unexpected reward omission (20% of randomly selected trials) (Fig. 5D right panel). A subset of ROIs (~37%) showed significantly increased DA transients that lasted during the short phase of "Go" stimulus presentation for both rewarded and non-rewarded trials (Fig. 5D , left panel). These transient increases during the stimulus presentation phase were not caused by the stimulus appearance itself, because no significant increase in DA levels was observed during miss trials during which the animal saw the stimulus, but did not respond (Fig. 5D ; yellow traces). To investigate whether these early responses shown in 37% of ROIs reflect increased DA levels during reward expectation or correlate with locomotion, we aligned the trials at running onset (Fig. 5E , group averages; fig. S16G , single ROIs) and compared the DA transients of runs triggered by the "Go" stimulus (when the animals expected a reward) with spontaneous runs that erroneously occurred during the stand-still phase (with no reward expectation). A small subset of responsive ROIs (5%) showed significant increases in DA transients during reward expectation but not spontaneous running (Fig. 5E , middle panel), whereas the other 32% of ROIs correlated with locomotion (Fig. 5E , left panel). The 63% of ROIs responsive to reward only (Fig. 5D , right panel) also showed increased DA transients during the early stimulus presentation phase consisting of both locomotion or reward expectation related responses (Fig. 5E , right panel). All three types of responses were consistently seen across animals. Comparing the heterogeneity of response transients between layer 1 and layers 2/3 of cortical area M1 (fig. S16E and F ) we found that layer 2/3 showed more ROIs active during reward. A similar number of ROIs responded to locomotion and reward expectation in both layers (fig. S16H ). Mesocortical dopaminergic projections are thus spatially intermingled and activation of these inputs leads to spatiotemporally heterogeneous DA signals in the cortex whose dynamics depends on motor behavior, reward expectation, and consumption. Conclusion We developed and applied a new class of genetically encoded indicators that overcome major barriers of current methods to permit high-resolution imaging of dopamine dynamics in acute brain slices and in behaving mice. The sub-micromolar affinity and fast kinetics of dLight1 offer fast temporal resolution (10 ms on and 100 ms off) to detect the physiologically or behaviorally relevant DA transients with higher molecular specificity compared to existing electrochemical or cell-based probes (14) . For example, in the NAc of freely behaving mice, longitudinal measurements revealed different changes in timeresolved dopamine signals encoding either predictive cue or reward consumption across learning. The disparate contributions of synaptic, extra-synaptic, and spillover dopamine events to circuit function are not addressable without fast, robust and genetically encoded sensors. In dorsal striatal slice, dLight1 reliably detected the concentration and time-course of dopamine transients and their modifications by pharmacological compounds. The rapid rise of fluorescence (10ms) and the peak concentration (10-30 μM) of dopamine following electrical stimulation indicates that the initial measures of dopamine are closely associated with the site of release (26) . The decline of fluorescence, particularly in the presence of cocaine, results primarily from reuptake and diffusion of dopamine away from release sites. dLight1 also permits high spatial resolution measurement of functionally-heterogeneous dopamine transients at the cellular level. In the cortex, 2P imaging with dLight1 revealed a dopamine transient map with spatially distributed, functionally heterogeneous dopamine signals during a visuomotor learning task. Simultaneous calcium imaging can further determine how spatiotemporal differences in DA levels relate to ongoing neural activity and influence associative learning or goal-directed behavior. dLight1.1 and dLight1.2 represent optimized sensor variants to be immediately applied to ex vivo or in vivo studies, as they offer a good balance between dynamic range and affinity. Other dLight variants may be suitable for measuring synaptic release (dLight 1.3) or tonic DA transients (dLight 1.4). Given the broadly tunable affinity and dynamic range of dLight1, protein engineering and high-throughput screening efforts can further optimize SNR and molecular specificity (36) , as well as performance of other neuromodulator indicators. In combination with calcium imaging and optogenetics, our sensors are well poised to permit direct functional analysis of how the spatiotemporal coding of neuromodulatory signaling mediates the plasticity and function of target circuits.

Introduction Neural activity causes rapid changes in intracellular free calcium [1] [2] [3] [4] . Calcium imaging experiments have relied on this principle to track the activity of neuronal populations 5, 6 and to probe excitation of small neurons and neuronal microcompartments 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Geneticallyencoded protein sensors can be targeted to specific cell types 2, 9, 11, 12 for non-invasive imaging of identified neurons and neuronal compartments 8, [13] [14] [15] over chronic timescales 6 . Calcium indicator proteins include the single fluorophore sensor GCaMP 11, 16, 17 and several families of Förster resonance energy transfer based sensors [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, none of these protein-based indicators have yet surpassed the sensitivity and speed of commonly used synthetic calcium indicators (e.g., Oregon Green Bapta-1-AM, OGB1-AM). Therefore, depending on the experimental goals, investigators choose between sensitive synthetic indicators delivered by invasive chemical or physical methods, or less sensitive protein sensors delivered with genetic methods. Multiple rounds of structure-guided design have made GCaMPs the most widely used protein calcium sensors 11, 16, 17 . But past efforts in optimizing GCaMPs and other indicators of neuronal function were limited by the throughput of quantitative and physiologically relevant assays. Because neurons have unusually fast calcium dynamics and low peak calcium accumulations 4 , sensors designed to probe neuronal function are best tested in neurons 11, 13, 23, 24 , rather than in non-neuronal systems, most of which show much slower and larger calcium changes 19 . We thus screened GCaMP variants produced by mutagenesis in neurons, and subsequently validated lead sensors in several in vivo systems. GCaMP protein engineering GCaMP 17 and its progeny 11, 16 consist of circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) 25 , the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), and CaM-interacting M13 peptide 26 (Fig. 1a ). The CaM/M13 complex is in proximity to the chromophore inside the cpGFP β barrel 27 . Calcium-dependent conformational changes in CaM/M13, including modulation of solvent access and the pK a of the chromophore, cause increased brightness with calcium binding. Despite extensive structure-guided optimization 11, 16 , GCaMP and other protein sensors still suffer from low sensitivity and slow kinetics. We produced numerous additional GCaMP variants and tested them in automated neuronal assays (Fig. 1 ). With the aim of improving sensitivity, we focused mutagenesis on the interface between cpGFP and CaM at 16 amino acid positions, some mutagenized to near completion (Fig. 1a , Supplementary Table 5 ) 16 . Mutations were made at 18 additional sites, notably at the M13/CaM interface which can affect calcium affinity 28 (A317) and in CaM (R392) 16 (Fig. 1a ). Dissociated rat hippocampal neurons in 24-well plates were transduced with GCaMP variants (one per well), together with nuclear mCherry 29 , using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. Electrodes triggered trains of action potentials in all neurons within each well (Methods). Time-lapse images (35 Hz) of ∼800 μm fields of view containing 10-100 neurons were acquired, while delivering a series of action potential trains (Fig. 1c ). Fluorescence changes extracted from single neurons were used to compare the sensitivity, dynamic range, and kinetics of individual GCaMP variants and OGB1-AM (Fig. 1d ). We monitored the resting brightness of the sensor by measuring green fluorescence relative to red mCherry fluorescence. The assay revealed 43/348 point mutants with improved sensitivity compared to GCaMP3 (ΔF/F 0 in response to one action potential; p < 0.01; Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Fig. 1c ; Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In addition, one mutation at the M13/CaM interface (A317E) accelerated kinetics (4-fold), but also reduced response amplitude (2-fold), compared to parent GCaMP variants (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). In a second round of mutagenesis we combined beneficial mutations, selected based on improved response amplitudes (1-3 action potentials) and/or kinetics, without compromising baseline fluorescence or maximal response (160 action potentials) (94 variants, up to 8 beneficial point mutations; Fig. 1a, c , Supplementary Table 5 ). In some cases the beneficial effects were additive (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). A317E consistently accelerated the kinetics compared to the parent sensors. In total, we screened 447 GCaMP variants (Supplementary Table 5 ). Based on screening in cultured neurons (Fig. 1 ), we chose three ultrasensitive GCaMP6 sensors (GCaMP6s, 6m, 6f; for slow, medium and fast kinetics, respectively) for characterization in vivo. These sensors vary in kinetics, with the more sensitive sensors having slower kinetics. Compared to GCaMP5G, the GCaMP6 sensors have similar baseline brightness and a 1.1-1.6 fold increase in dynamic range (ΔF/F0 at 160 action potentials). For small numbers of action potentials the most sensitive sensor, GCaMP6s, produced 7-fold larger signals (>10-fold larger than GCaMP3, Fig. 1b -e; Supplementary Table 1 ). Underlying this sensitivity gain are multiple factors (Supplementary Table 2 ). Compared to GCaMP5G, GCaMP6s exhibited 3-fold higher apparent affinity for calcium and 1.3-fold higher saturated fluorescence, with similar baseline fluorescence. Calcium-saturated GCaMP6s is 27% brighter than enhanced GFP (EGFP), its parent fluorescent protein. The fastest sensor, GCaMP6f, had 2-fold faster rise time and 1.7-fold faster decay time than GCaMP5G (Fig. 1f , g) (Supplementary Table 1 ). GCaMP6f is the fastest geneticallyencoded calcium indicator for cytoplasmic free calcium in neurons, with sensitivity comparable to OGB1-AM (Fig. 1d-g ). GCaMP6 indicators were more sensitive and/or faster than other GCaMP variants in presynaptic boutons of the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction 24 (Supplementary Fig. 3 ; Supplementary Table 4 ), in projection neurons of the Drosophila adult antennal lobe during odor presentation 16 (Supplementary Fig. 4 ), and in neuropil and somata of the zebrafish tectum in vivo 16 (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Imaging neuronal populations in the mouse visual cortex We next tested GCaMP6 in layer (L)2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mouse visual cortex V1 in vivo (Fig. 2a ). The majority of V1 neurons can be driven to fire action potentials in response to drifting gratings 30 . V1 was infected with adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing GCaMP variants (AAV-hsyn1-GCaMP variant) 11 . Three weeks after AAV infection, the vast majority of L2/3 neurons showed fluorescence mainly in the neuronal cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Sensory stimuli consisted of moving gratings presented in eight directions to the contralateral eye 12, 16 . Two-photon imaging revealed visual stimulus-evoked fluorescence transients in subsets of neurons (Fig. 2a-c ). These responses were stable across trials (Supplementary Fig. 8 ) and tuned to stimulus orientation (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Orientation tuning was similar for GCaMP5G, GCaMP6f, GCaMP6m, and bulk-loaded OGB1-AM 5 (Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Fluorescence transients were faster with GCaMP6f compared to other sensors and faithfully tracked dynamic sensory stimuli (Fig. 2d ). GCaMP6 performance was compared to other sensors in several ways. The fraction of responding neurons detected with GCaMP6s was 3-fold higher than for GCaMP5G (5-fold higher than GCaMP3) (Fig. 2e ). Notably, the fractions of active neurons detected with GCaMP6s and GCaMP6m were also significantly higher than for OGB1-AM (Fig. 2e , f, p<0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test). GCaMP6 sensors thus reveal neuronal dynamics that were previously undetectable with protein sensors. We imaged GCaMP6s-expressing neurons through a chronic imaging window 6, 31 over several weeks in V1 (Supplementary Fig. 6c ) 18 . Sensory responses and orientation tuning of neurons were largely stable (Supplementary Fig. 6c, e ). Responses of a small fraction of neurons were lost over time, which was balanced by other neurons that started responding. The orientation preference of the neurons responding in all imaging sessions (∼56% of cells that responded in the first session) was remarkably stable (Supplementary Fig. 6d ). Over months of expression a small fraction of highly expressing neurons acquired nuclear fluorescence; these neurons eventually also developed aberrant responses 11 (Supplementary Fig. 7 ). These experiments indicate that expression of GCaMP6s over 1-2 months does not obviously perturb the function of cortical circuits. We directly compared cellular fluorescence changes and spiking using loose-seal, cellattached recordings. The contrast of the visual stimulus was adjusted online to maintain a moderate spike rate. GCaMP6s produced large fluorescence transients even in response to single action potentials (> 6 times larger than for GCaMP5K, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video 1), yielding high detection rates for single spikes (99 ± 0.2%; at 1% false-positive rate, n=9 cells, 250 spikes). GCaMP6f and GCaMP6m showed slightly lower spike detection efficiencies, but with faster kinetics (Fig. 3 , Supplementary Table 3 ). Individual spikes within a burst resulted in step-wise fluorescence increases (Fig. 3b ), which were resolvable if they were separated by an interval on the order of the rise time of the sensor or more (100-150 ms, GCaMP6s; 75-100 ms, GCaMP6m; 50-75 ms, GCaMP6f; Fig. 3f , Supplementary Fig. 10 , Supplementary Table 3 ). These data show that GCaMP6s can detect activity with near 100% action potential detection in pyramidal cells. Calcium transients in dendritic spines Pyramidal neuron output is shaped by thousands of excitatory synapses distributed across the dendritic arbor. Activation of single excitatory synapses causes calcium accumulations in individual dendritic spines, mediated by NMDA-Rs 32, 33 , which can be imaged to measure the tuning of single synapses in vivo 10, 33 . We used GCaMP6s to image synaptic calcium signals within dendritic spines over chronic timescales. In V1 with sparsely labeled L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Methods) small dendritic branches were imaged at high magnification during visual stimulation (Fig. 4a ). We first focused on neurons that did not fire visually evoked action potentials (∼40% of neurons) to avoid calcium changes caused by action potentials back-propagating into dendrites 7 . Individual spines showed large fluorescence transients, often independent of their parent dendrites (Fig. 4b, d and Supplementary Video 2). Spine responses were orientation-tuned (Fig. 4b-e ), as expected from the fact that most input to V1 neurons originates from (presumably orientation-tuned) V1 neurons 34 . Neighboring spines were often tuned with different preferred orientations. The correlation between orientation tuning and distance between spines was weak (R=0.08; p>0.05). Overall, 27% of spines (62/228, 15 dendrites, 4 mice) were visually responsive, and most were orientation-tuned (Fig. 4f, g ). Furthermore, close to 40% of spines were active at some time during the imaging session (Fig. 4f ). Bleaching of GCaMP6 was negligible over 40 imaging trials (320 s of continuous imaging, Fig. 4h ). We imaged the same dendritic segments over imaging sessions separated by weeks. Most spines persisted over this timescale, although other spines appeared and disappeared 31 . We analyzed the visual responses of persistent spines. The percentage of spines that responded to visual stimulation was stable over a week (37/139 on day 1; 34/139 on day 8). Spines that responded during one imaging session were also likely to respond a week later (65%). Furthermore, visually responsive spines mostly retained their orientation tuning (Fig. 4i-k ). How orientation-tuned neurons connect to other orientation-tuned neurons remains controversial 10, 35 . Some measurements suggest that individual neurons sample heterogeneous input, from neurons with diverse orientation-tuning 10 . Models indicate that specific connectivity is not required for orientation tuning 36 . However, other measurements emphasize that neurons prefer to make synapses with neurons sharing similar orientation tuning 35 , but orientation tuning at the level of subthreshold membrane potential is weak 37, 38 . We thus compared the orientation tuning of populations of individual spines and the output of their parent neuron. We identified neurons with tuned output (OSI, 0.91 ± 0.04, n=5) (Fig. 5a ) and measured the orientation tuning of large numbers of dendritic spines per neuron (average, 201 spines; range, 120-298 spines) (Fig. 5b-d ). Contributions to the signal from back-propagating action potentials were removed using a computational subtraction procedure (Methods; Supplementary Fig. 11 ). For individual neurons, the orientation tuning averaged across all spines was biased towards the orientation tuning of the parent neurons (Fig. 5e, f ) (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test), although the modulation depth for spines was smaller (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test). A similar trend was also apparent in the distributions of preferred orientations across spines (Fig. 5g, h ). Our results show that spine fluorescence transients, which are not necessarily good predictors of the strength of excitatory synaptic input 39 , averaged across a neuron predict the orientation tuning of the cell's output. Calcium transients in GABAergic dendrites Consistent with previous results 40, 41 , somatic fluorescence changes in GABAergic neurons were broadly tuned with respect to stimulus orientation (Fig. 6a, b ; Supplementary Fig. 12 ). However, their dendrites showed pronounced orientation-tuned domains (Fig. 6c, d ). Individual dendritic branches often had multiple domains with distinct preferred orientations, consistent with the diverse preferences of inputs to GABAergic neurons 42, 43 . The underlying fluorescence responses were modulated at the temporal frequency of the drifting grating (1 Hz) (Fig. 6e ), a characteristic feature of V1 excitatory neurons in the superficial layers of V1 30 , suggesting that the responses reflect local excitatory synaptic input. Tuned dendritic domains were seen in parvalbumin-positive (Fig. 6 ) and somatostatinpositive (data not shown) interneurons. We mapped the visual response along 104 interneuron dendrites (total imaged length 6.3 mm) with regions of interest placed every micrometer along the dendrite (Fig. 6d ). Visuallyevoked GCaMP6s responses were detected in 5.7 mm (90 %) of dendritic length, with 1.79 mm (28%) showing significant orientation-tuning (p < 0.01, ANOVA across 8 conditions). The majority of imaged dendrites (33/54; longer than 50 μm) had multiple domains preferring different orientations. The OSI (0.44 ± 0.15; mean ± s.d.) of tuned dendritic segments was higher than for interneuron somata (p < 0.005, Supplementary Fig. 12 ), but lower than for typical pyramidal neurons (p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Backpropagation 44 of broadly tuned somatic action potentials probably lowers the OSI of the dendritic calcium signals. Consistent with this, both the dendritic OSI and the percentage of orientation selective sites increased with distance from the soma (Supplementary Fig. 13a ). The sizes of individual domains (12 ± 7 μm, mean ± s.d. FWHM, n=107 domains) were considerably larger than the spacing between excitatory synapses on interneuron dendrites (<1 μm) 45 (Supplementary Fig. 13b, c ). Nearby domains with distinct preferred orientations often overlapped (Supplementary Fig. 13b ). The large size of these domains might reflect spatially clustered input with shared orientation preference. Alternatively, individual domains might be dominated by a few sparse, randomly distributed strong inputs 46 , amplified by local postsynaptic mechanisms 47 Conclusions We developed a new class of genetically-encoded indicators of neuronal function with greatly improved properties. GCaMP6 indicators cross important performance thresholds. They have higher sensitivity than commonly used synthetic calcium dyes (e.g., OGB1) and detect individual action potentials with high reliability at reasonable microscope magnifications. These indicators can be used to image large groups of neurons as well as tiny synaptic compartments over multiple imaging sessions separated by months. It is likely that these sensors will find widespread applications for diverse problems in brain research and calcium signaling. Future engineering efforts could focus on red fluorescent calcium indicator proteins 48, 49 , which promise imaging considerably deeper in scattering tissue 50 . Methods All experiments were conducted according to National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Janelia Farm Research Campus Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Institutional Biosafety Committee. Neuronal culture screen GCaMP variants were made in a modified SIV-based lentiviral construct, pGP-syn-GCaMPnls-mCherry-WPRE, derived from pCL20cSLFR MSCV-GFP 51 . The prolentiviral vector included a 476-bp human synapsin promoter, GCaMP, a nuclear localization sequence fused to mCherry, and the woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element. Sitedirected mutagenesis was conducted by PCR and mutated regions were incorporated into the lentiviral constructs by gene assembly 52 . Hippocampi were dissected and dissociated in papain. Cells were plated at a density of 225,000 viable cells/well in 24-well glass-bottom plates (Mattek, #1.5 glass coverslips), precoated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were cultured in growth medium (28 mM glucose, 2.4 mM sodium bicarbonate, 100 μg/mL transferrin, B-27 supplement (1X, Invitrogen), 500 μM L-glutamine, 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 mg/mL streptomycin, 5% fetal bovine serum in MEM). Lentiviral particles were made in a biosafety level 2 laboratory by transfecting a prolentiviral construct and packaging and coat pseudotyping DNA constructs (pCAG-SIVgprre, pCAG4-RTR-SIV, pCMV-VSV-G) 51, 53 into HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC) in 10cm plates. After 72 h, supernatant was collected (6 mL) and filtered. Neuronal cultures were infected at 3 days in vitro. Each well of a 24-well plate was incubated overnight with 0.5 mL of lentivirus in conditioned growth medium. The growth medium was supplemented with 4 μM AraC to inhibit glial proliferation. In some experiments, OGB1-AM was loaded into cells by incubating neurons in 1 mL of 2 μM OGB1-AM (Invitrogen) for 30 min and rinsing 3 times with imaging buffer (145 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 ). Neurons were stimulated in imaging buffer containing a drug cocktail to inhibit synaptic receptors (10 μM CNQX, 10 μM (R)-CPP, 10 μM gabazine, 1 mM (S)-MCPG, Tocris). Under these conditions, intracellular calcium increases are presumably caused by the opening of voltage sensitive calcium channels. Action potentials (APs) (83 Hz) were evoked by field stimulation with a Grass Technologies S48 stimulation unit and a custom-built 24-well cap stimulator with pairs of parallel platinum wires. The microscope was an Olympus IX81 with a 10× (0.4 NA) air objective lens and EMCCD camera (Andor 897, 512 × 512 pixels, 35 frames/s), Cairn OptoLED illumination system, and GFP (Excitation: 450-490 nm; Dichroic: 495 nm long-pass; Emission: 500-550 nm) and TxRed (Excitation: 540-580 nm; Dichroic: 585 nm long-pass; Emission: 593-668 nm) filter sets. The field of view was 800 μm × 800 μm. Images were background subtracted (mean of 5% lowest pixel values). Responses were quantified for each cell as change in fluorescence divided by baseline fluorescence measured one second prior to stimulation. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was quantified as peak ΔF/F 0 response over the standard deviation of the signal during a one second period prior to stimulation. Control experiments varying stimulation voltage, frequency, and pulse width insured suprathreshold stimulation of neurons. Voltage imaging using the ArchWT-GFP archaerhodopsin-based voltage sensor 54 confirmed that individual pulses (1 ms, 40 V, 83 Hz) reliably triggered single APs. The imaging and stimulation system was controlled by custom scripts written in MetaMorph software (version 7.7.5, Molecular Devices) and Ephus software 55 (ephus.org). Detailed neuronal culture screening methods will be described elsewhere (T.J.W., T.W.C., E.R.S., R.A.K., V.J., L.L.L., K.S., and D.S.K., manuscript in preparation). Labeling V1 neurons Constructs used to produce AAV included pGP-AAV-syn-GCaMP-WPRE and the Cre recombinase-activated construct pGP-AAV-syn-flex-GCaMP-WPRE. Virus was injected slowly (30 nL in 5 minutes) at a depth of 250 μm into the primary visual cortex (two sites, 2.5 and 2.9 mm lateral from the lambda suture). For population imaging and electrophysiology (Fig 2 3 ), AAV2/1-syn-GCaMP-WPRE virus (titer: ∼10 11 -10 12 genomes/mL) was injected into the visual cortex of C57BL/6J mice (1.5-2 months old) 6 . For dendritic imaging (Fig 4 , 5 and 6a-f), sparse labeling was achieved by injecting a mixture of diluted AAV2/1-syn-Cre particles (titer: ∼10 12 genomes/mL, diluted 8000-20,000 fold in PBS) and high titer, Cre-dependent GCaMP6s virus (∼8×10 11 genomes/mL). This produces strong GCaMP6 expression in a small subset of neurons (∼3-5 cells in a 250 μm × 250 μm × 250 μm volume), defined by Cre expression 56 . Both pyramidal (Fig. 4 5 ) and GABAergic (Fig. 6 ) neurons were labeled using this approach, but they could be distinguished based on the presence or absence of dendritic spines. Post hoc immunolabeling further identified the imaged cells. For specific labeling of parvalbumin interneurons (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 12 ), Cre-dependent GCaMP6s AAV was injected into the visual cortex of PV-IRES-Cre mice 57 . Individual somata (Supplementary Fig. 12 ) and dendritic segments could be recognized (Fig. 6 g, h, total length of imaged dendrite: 2.86 mm), but the high labeling density made it difficult to track individual dendrites over long distances. Window surgery After 2-4 weeks of expression, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3% for induction, 1.5-2% during surgery) and a circular craniotomy (2-3 mm diameter) was made above V1 (centered 2.7 mm lateral from the lambda suture). For acute experiments, the craniotomy was covered with agarose (1-1.3 %), and a round glass coverslip (Warner Instruments; 5mm diameter; #1 thickness) was cemented to the skull to reduce motion of the exposed brain. A custom titanium head post was fixed to the skull using black dental cement (Contemporary Ortho-Jet). For simultaneous imaging and cell-attached recording, the exposed brain was covered with ∼1 mm thick agarose (1.3%) without a coverslip. For chronic imaging experiments, the imaging window was constructed from two layers of microscope coverglass 6 . A larger piece (Fisher, #1 thickness) was attached to the bone and a smaller insert (#2 thickness) was fitted snugly into the craniotomy. Imaging experiments were started ∼1-2 weeks after chronic window implantation. Visual stimuli Moving grating stimuli were generated using the Psychophysics Toolbox 58, 59 in MATLAB. Each stimulus trial consisted of a 4 s blank period (uniform gray at mean luminance) followed by a 4 s drifting sinusoidal grating (0.05 cycles per degree, 1 Hz temporal frequency). Typically, 8 drifting directions were used (separated by 45 degrees) and 5 trials were recorded for each direction, giving a total of 40 stimulus trials per recording session (320 s recording time). The gratings were presented with an LCD monitor (30 × 40 cm), placed 25 cm in front of the center of the right eye of the mouse. The monitor subtended an angle of ±38° horizontally and -20° to +38° vertically around the eye of the mouse. For experiments with cell-attached recording (Fig. 3 ), pipette access required the use of a smaller LCD monitor (12 × 16 cm) placed ∼10 cm in front of the right eye. During simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology, the optimal grating stimulus was repeatedly played (duration 2 s, separated by a 4 s blank period), but the contrast of the stimulus grating was adjusted online to maintain moderate spike rates. For analysis of dendritic spine populations (Fig. 5 ), the stimulus contrast was lowered to reduce action potential-related dendritic signals (average ΔF/F 0 in dendritic shafts at the preferred orientations was 32%, 80%. 16%, 15%, 12% for cells 1 through 5, corresponding to stimulus contrast 10-40%, 5-20%, 10-40%, 20-40%, 20-40%). The orientation preference of dendritic shafts was identical to the soma, consistent with back-propagating action potentials (data not shown). Orientation tuning of GABAergic dendrites (Fig. 6 ) was mapped using the standard stimulus set at full contrast. The stimulus duration was 2 s; because of the slower decay of calcium transients 41 we used a 6 s inter trial interval. Imaging mouse V1 neurons and dendrites Mice were placed on a warm blanket (37°C) and kept anesthetized with 0.5% isoflurane and sedated with chlorprothixene (20-40 μL at 0.33 mg/ml, i.m.) 30 . Imaging was performed using a custom-built two-photon microscope (designs available at research.janelia.org/ Svoboda) equipped with a resonant galvo scanning module (Thorlabs), controlled by ScanImage (scanimage.org) 60 . The light source was a Mai Tai femtosecond pulsed laser (Spectra-Physics) running at 940 nm. The objective was a 16× water immersion lens (Nikon, 0.8 NA, 3 mm working distance). The power used was 35-50 mW for full field imaging (Fig. 2 ) and 20-40 mW for higher zoom imaging (Fig. 3 4 5 6 ). Images were collected at 15 Hz (512 × 512 pixels, 250 μm × 250 μm; Fig. 2 ) or 60 Hz (256 × 256 pixels, 30 μm × 30 μm; Fig. 3 ), or 15 Hz (512 × 512 pixels, 30 μm × 30 μm; Fig. 4 5 ), or 15 Hz (512 × 512 pixels, 30 μm × 30 μm -100 μm × 100 μm; Fig. 6 ). For dendritic imaging experiments (Fig. 4 5 6 ), fields of view were chosen so that extended dendritic segments were in one focal plane. At the end of each imaging session, z-stacks (1 μm step size) of the recorded cells were acquired. The coordinates of the imaged dendrites relative to the parent somata were recorded. The orientation, curvature, and the branching pattern of the dendrites together with the constellation of spines, helped to precisely identify the same field of view in long-term imaging experiments. Electrophysiology In vivo cell-attached recordings were performed using glass pipettes (∼5-7 MΩ) filled with solution containing the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl 2 , 2 MgSO 4 , and 0.1 Alexa Fluor 594; pH 7.4). Signals were amplified using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 5 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Spikes were recorded using current clamp mode. The frame trigger pulses of ScanImage 4.0 were also recorded and used offline to synchronize individual frames to electrophysiological recordings. After establishment of a low-resistance seal (15-50 MΩ), the orientation, spatial and temporal frequency of the stimuli was quickly optimized for individual neurons using recorded spikes. The optimal grating stimulus was repeated at a reduced contrast to maintain a moderate spiking rate. Image analysis Mechanical drift in the imaging plane was corrected using the TurboReg plug-in in ImageJ 61 . All remaining analyses were performed in MATLAB. Regions-of-interest (ROIs) corresponding to visually identifiable cell bodies were selected using a semi-automated algorithm (Supplementary Fig. 14 ). For GCaMP, ring-shaped ROIs were placed at the cytosolic regions of the cells (excluding the nucleus; GCaMP expression is typically restricted to the cytoplasm 11 ). For OGB1-AM, circular ROIs covering the whole soma were used. For long-term GCaMP imaging, baseline fluorescence images of multiple sessions were inspected manually, and only the cells that could be clearly identified in all imaged sessions were included in the analysis. The fluorescence time course of each cell was measured by averaging all pixels within the ROI, with a correction for neuropil contamination 41 . The fluorescence signal of a cell body was estimated as F cell_true (t)=F cell_measured (t)-r*F neuropil (t), with r=0.7. The neuropil signal F neuropil (t) surrounding each cell was measured by averaging the signal of all pixels within a 20 μm region from the cell center (excluding all selected cells). Cell-attached recordings confirmed that neuropil-compensated fluorescence changes reflect action potentials in single neurons (Supplementary Fig. 15 ). To ensure robust neuropil subtraction, only cells that were at least 3% brighter than the surrounding neuropil were included. The neuropil correction was not applied for dendritic imaging experiments because sparse labeling provided negligibly low background. ΔF/F 0 was calculated as (F-F 0 )/F 0 , where F 0 is the baseline fluorescence signal averaged over a 2 second period immediately before the start of visual stimulation. Visual responses were measured for each trial as ΔF/F 0 , averaged over the stimulus period. Visually responsive neurons were defined as cells with significant stimulus-related fluorescence changes (ANOVA across blank and eight direction periods, p<0.01) 5 with an average ΔF/F 0 at preferred orientations greater than 6%. The orientation selectivity index (OSI) was calculated for visually responsive cells 16, 30 . First, the preferred orientation (θ pref ) of the cell was determined as the stimulus that produced the strongest response. The orientation tuning curve was constructed by measuring the mean ΔF/F 0 , averaged over the stimulus period, for each orientation. We then fitted the tuning curve with the sum of two Gaussians centered on θ pref and θ pref + π, both with width σ (constrained to >15°), amplitudes A1 and A2, and a constant baseline B. The OSI was defined as OSI=(R pref -R ortho )/(R pref +R ortho ), where R pref and R ortho are the response amplitudes at the preferred (θ pref ) and the orthogonal orientation (θ pref + π/2) respectively. For simultaneous imaging and cell-attached recording, ring-shaped ROIs were placed over the cytosolic regions of the cells. Fluorescence transients at the soma were caused by action potentials, with little contribution from subthreshold activity 62 (Supplementary Fig. 15 ). To quantify the efficiency for detecting single APs (Fig. 3 ), we identified single AP events with nearby APs at least 1 s away. Fluorescence traces consisting of 10 frames (0.17 s) before and 60 frames (1 s) after the i th 1 AP event were assembled in 70-dimensional vectors, f i . Segments of noisy traces, n i were taken from periods without APs. The average of all 1 AP traces was used as a template vector, f template =Σ i f i /N. The vector was normalized after subtraction of the mean to create a unit vector f ̂template . The projection of f i or n i along the direction of f ̂template was calculated to obtain a scalar f i or n i , respectively. The AP detection threshold was defined as the 99 th percentile of all n i values (i.e., 1% false positive), and the percentage of the f i values above the detection threshold was the AP detection efficiency. For spine images (Fig. 4 5 ), circular ROIs were placed over individual dendritic spines to measure spine fluorescence and compute ΔF/F 0_spine . To minimize contamination from back-propagating action potentials (BAPs), we either recorded from 'silent cells' (∼ 40 % of cells) showing few or no APs in response to a standard set of grating stimuli (Fig. 4 ), or used stimuli with reduced stimulus contrast (Fig. 5 ). Occasional BAP related calcium signals that invaded the imaged spines were removed using a subtraction method, implemented in three steps (Supplementary Fig. 11 ). First, a region covering the entire parent dendritic shaft (∼30 micrometers of dendritic length; excluding all spines) was drawn for each recorded dendritic segment to estimate BAP related global dendritic signal, ΔF/F 0_dendrite . Because of the much larger volume of the dendritic shaft compared to tuned dendritic spines (100-fold), spines above and below the focal plane were expected to contribute negligible signal to ΔF/F 0_dendrite . This was verified using principle component analysis (data not shown). Plotting ΔF/F 0_spine against ΔF/F 0_dendrite reveals two components of spine signals, a BAP-related component and a spine-specific component. Second, the BAP-related component was removed from the spine signals by subtracting a scaled version of the dendritic shaft signal, ΔF/F 0_spine_specific =ΔF/F 0_spine -α •ΔF/ F 0_dendrite . α was determined using robust regression (MATLAB function 'robustfit.m') of ΔF/F 0_spine vs. ΔF/F 0_dendrite (the slope of the fitted line in Supplementary Fig. 11b ). Third, the visual responsiveness (ΔF/F 0 > 10%) and the OSI of individual spines were calculated with the BAP signal removed. Active spines (Fig. 4f ) were defined as spines showing at least three spine-specific (i.e., BAP independent) calcium events during the 5 minute imaging session, with an event defined as an episode of the calcium signal that crosses 3 s.d. of the baseline noise for at least three consecutive frames (∼50 ms). We next confirmed the effectiveness of the BAP removal algorithm. First, BAP removed spine signals showed sharp orientation tuning (OSI = 0.84 ± 0.14, mean ± s.d., n=190 spines) comparable to V1 excitatory neurons (Supplementary Fig. 9 , p>>0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum). This holds even for spines preferring the orthogonal orientation compared to the soma (OSI=0.82 ± 0.16, n=24 spines), indicating that the BAP contamination was cleanly removed. Second, the majority (79.7%) of visually responsive spines showed little trial-totrial correlation with the dendritic shaft signal after BAP subtraction. 20.3% spines still displayed significant correlation with shaft responses compared to trial shuffled controls (p<0.01). This could reflect synchronously active pre-synaptic cells, or imperfect BAP action potential signal subtraction. Because we were unable to distinguish between these possibilities, these spines were excluded from further analysis. In two cells (cell 4 and cell 5; Fig. 5 ), we collected larger numbers of trials (15 trials per orientation), which made it possible to further exclude trials with detectable dendritic responses (ΔF/F 0 > 6%). The result (i.e., the preferred orientation of the summed spine responses) was identical as with using the subtraction procedure alone. For the analysis of GABAergic cells (Fig. 6 ), dendrites were traced using 'Simple neurite tracer' in ImageJ 63 . The program outputs a 1D sequence of coordinates traversing a dendrite and a 2D mask covering the traced dendrite, which were used to define ROIs along the dendrite (size, 1.5 μm of dendritic length; spacing, 1 μm). Visual responsiveness and orientation selectivity index were computed for individual ROIs. A region of dendrite is considered orientation selective if its response to least one stimulus orientation is significantly different from other orientations (p < 0.01, ANOVA across 8 conditions). Because synaptic and BAP signals were intermixed in the same dendritic compartment, no attempt was made to isolate synaptic signals from BAP-related components. We did not analyze the relationship between integrated synaptic signals and the output tuning in GABAergic cells. Reagent distribution DNA constructs and AAV particles with GCaMP6 variants were deposited for distribution at Addgene (www.addgene.org) and the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core (www.med.upenn.edu/gtp/vectorcore) and the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (flystocks.bio.indiana.edu), respectively.

Introduction Movement disorders including Parkinson's disease and Tourette's syndrome are hypothesized to result from disruptions of basal ganglia circuitry [1] [2] [3] [4] . Within the basal ganglia, the dorsal striatum serves as a point of integration between cortical and sub-cortical regions that transforms information provided by these inputs to an output signal that guides behavior 5, 6 . Medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) are the major target of these inputs as well as the primary source of projections from the striatum. These cells comprise roughly 95% of all striatal neurons 7, 8 , and are traditionally classified based on the target of their output in the Globus Pallidus and the presence of dopamine D1 (direct pathway) or D2 (indirect pathway) receptors 9 . Imbalance between these pathways is thought to contribute to the expression of motor pathologies 2, 10, 11 . Despite having disparate projection pathways and being differentially regulated by dopamine, recent calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging studies suggest that these two unique MSNs populations could be uniformly engaged during movement and share a remarkably similar activity profile during normal locomotion [12] [13] [14] [15] . These recent findings suggest that coordinated activity in D1 and D2 MSN population supports normal voluntary movement, and disrupting the balance of activity between these two pathways contributes to disease pathology 11 . The mechanisms underlying this coordination are less well understood, although they likely include contributions of local interneurons. In addition to MSNs, the dorsal striatum also contains multiple populations of interneurons, each of which represent only a small fraction of the total population of cells (<5% per type) 7, 16, 17 . Though few in number, each interneuron class has the potential to shape striatal activity and function through its innervation of the MSN projection network 18, 19 . Two of the best characterized striatal interneurons are the parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) and cholinergic interneurons (CHIs). PVs are GABAergic and can provide a potent source of inhibition on the activity of nearby MSNs to support motor control [20] [21] [22] . CHIs are a major source of striatal acetylcholine (ACh) 23, 24 . These extensively arborized cells can directly modulate the activity state of MSNs via muscarinic ACh receptors expressed by both D1 and D2 populations of MSNs 25, 26 , and have likewise been implicated in normal control of motor output 23, 27, 28 . The unique roles of PVs and CHIs in generating the MSN network dynamics that support movement remain unknown. Efforts to understand how sparsely distributed striatal interneurons interact with MSNs to support behavior have been hampered by a lack of experimental approaches that allow for the simultaneous monitoring of genetically defined interneuron populations in combination with large numbers of MSNs. To gain further insight into interneuron-MSN interactions in support of movement, we utilized a wide-field calcium imaging platform that enabled us to monitor and optogenetically manipulate interneurons, while simultaneously recording calcium dynamics in hundreds of surrounding MSNs in mice during voluntary locomotion. We find that PV and CHI interneuron types differ from one another, and from MSNs, in how they contribute to movement and how they regulate populations of MSN networks that guide behavior. PV interneurons best predict movement and reduce the level of MSN population activity in the dorsal striatum during movement events. CHIs, in contrast, have a more selective role in recruiting and synchronizing the activity of MSNs during movement to suppress or end a movement bout. Our combined evidence demonstrates the unique capacity of different classes of striatal interneurons to organize networks of MSNs in support of discrete aspects of voluntary locomotion. Results Simultaneous monitoring of MSN networks and PVs or CHIs during movement To simultaneously monitor activity in interneurons in conjunction with the surrounding population of dorsal striatal MSNs, PV-Cre and Chat-Cre mice were injected with AAV-Syn-GCaMP6f 29 to label all striatal neurons with the calcium activity indicator GCaMP6f. AAV-CAG-flex-tdTomato was also co-injected to allow us to label and identify GCaMP6f expressing interneuron cell types (see Figure 1A-C and Figure S1A for experimental timeline). AAV viral mediated flex-targeting allows for highly specific targeting of neuron classes and we found that 96.1±0.2% of tdTomato cells were immunoreactive for PV antibody in PV-Cre mice (Figure S1B-C ); and 97.2±0.2% of tdTomato cells were immunoreactive for Chat in Chat-Cre mice (Figure S1D-E ) in the area below the imaging window. These numbers were consistent with measures reported previously for these specific transgenic mouse lines 28, 30 . Importantly, we also found that <1% of cells coexpressed GCaMP and tdTomato but were immuno-negative for the corresponding Chat or PV antibody in Chat-Cre or PV-Cre mice respectively, demonstrating selectivity. Calcium responses for the three populations of cells in our experiments were recorded as mice freely ran on a spherical treadmill while tracking movement (Figure 1A ). Animals were positioned and imaged underneath a custom microscope equipped with a scientific CMOS camera and imaged at 10X (Figure 1B ). This yielded an imaging field of view of 1.343 × 1.343 mm with each pixel corresponding to 1.312 × 1.312 μm 2 , allowing in excess of 100 pixels to contribute to a single cell. GCaMP6f excitation was accomplished with a 460 nm LED, and tdTomato excitation with a 567 nm LED (Figure 1B ; for a complete description of the labeling, ROI identification, and motion acquisition procedure see Supplemental Methods). As shown in Figure 1C , this approach allowed us to monitor activity in genetically defined interneurons (CHIs: n=5.1±1.1 cells per session, PV: n=4.4±0.8, mean±SEM) in combination with large numbers of surrounding neurons (281.6±34.2, cells per session, mean±SEM). The vast majority of striatal cells are MSNs (~95%); therefore all GCaMP-positive and tdTomato-negative cells were treated as MSNs for the purpose of analysis (see Supplemental Methods for full description of dual labeling approach and analysis). All statistical tests are reported in the corresponding figure legends and are corrected for multiple comparisons. A complete description of all tests and statistical models can be found in Supplemental Methods and the Life Sciences Reporting Summary. Striatal activity during locomotion We found that the bulk striatal fluorescence (averaged activity across all cells) increased during periods of movement (high speed) and decreased during periods of no or low movement (low speed, Figure 1D , E, Video S1). For this reason, we focused our analyses around the time of movement onsets as well as peaks in velocity. In a typical 10 min recording session, 15-20 such locomotion events occurred (Chat-Cre mice, 20.1±4.1 onset events, n=6 mice; PV-Cre mice, 14.9±3.0, n=6 mice; mean±SEM), with the average period of high movement velocity lasting 5.1±0.1 (mean±SEM) seconds. Individual MSN calcium events showed a sharp increase and an exponential decay (see Figure 2A (top; for representative traces). Over all, calcium events were most frequent in MSNs of the three neuron types (Figure 2B ), and had the greatest amplitude (Figure S2A ). Similar to recent imaging experiments in genetically defined populations of D1 and D2 MSNs, we found that the vast majority of MSNs exhibited a sharp increase in fluorescence at movement onset (Figure 2D ), although we did detect a proportion of MSNs that were either negatively (21.4%), or non-modulated (24.2%) by movement (Figure S3 ). As a population, MSN fluorescence rose coincident with movement onset (Figure 2D-E ), peaked coincident with maximum velocity (Figure 2F -G), and then declined as movement slowed (Figure 1D-E ). Calcium events in PV cells were slow to rise and long lasting (Figure 2A (middle), 2C; S2B-C; Video S2), consistent with calcium responses previously noted in PV neurons from cortical regions 31 . Like MSNs, PVs overwhelmingly exhibited increases in fluorescence around motion onset (Figure 2D-E ; while only 13.9% of the PV population were negatively modulated at movement onset; see Figure S3C and Figure S4 for a full characterization of positively and the small subset of negatively modulated PVs). The increase in PV activity preceded MSNs by 523.1±304.3ms (mean±SEM; n=13 sessions, Figure 2D ; see Figure S5 and Figure S6 for individual examples and supplemental methods for details). Indeed, PV cells also showed the highest proportion of neurons positively modulated in the 500ms before movement onset (Figure S2H ), providing further evidence for a rise in PV activity preceding motion onset and MSN activity. Additional analyses showed that in the 1.5 s following a calcium event in the PV population, PVs calcium events were uniquely associated with a positive change in velocity (Figure 2H ; S2I). Calcium events in CHIs had similar event rates across periods of movement as PVs (Figure 2B ), and had the smallest area under the curve of all neuron classes (Figure 2A (bottom), 2C), despite having similar rise times and event widths as MSNs (Figure S2B-C ). As a population, CHIs showed a modest, but not statistically significant increase in fluorescence at motion onset (Figure 2D-E ). Rather, CHI population fluorescence reached maximum intensity approximately 2 seconds after peak velocity (Figure 2F -G, Video S3). Analysis of changes in movement speed following CHI calcium events further indicated that speed dramatically declined following CHI calcium events (Figure 2H ; S2I). Further analyses indicated that CHIs were unique amongst the three cell types in that equal numbers of cells were positively (43.1%) or negatively (37.3%) modulated by motion onset, which likely contributed to the small change in CHI population fluorescence described above (see also Figure S3C ). The fluorescence of positively modulated CHIs peaked around maximum velocity (Figure S7C-D ) similar to MSNs. In contrast, the negatively modulated CHIs exhibited increased fluorescence 2 seconds after maximum velocity (Figure S7C ), the same trend was observed when we considered the CHI population as a whole and described above (Figure 2F-G ). Analysis of speed following calcium events in either positively or negatively modulated CHIs revealed that both populations were followed by similar reductions in speed in the 2 seconds after CHI events (Figure S7H ). Thus while the two CHI populations became active at different time points in the movement sequence, each population was active prior to reductions in movement. Distinct, causal roles for PV and CHI interneurons in movement In our correlative analysis described above, PV neurons homogeneously become active prior to movement bouts, perhaps providing a unified signal to increase the vigor or specificity of future locomotion. CHIs, while more heterogeneous than PVs or MSNs, as a population become active after peaks in velocity, and calcium events in CHIs were followed by reductions in speed. If each interneuron type is causing rather than tracking these changes in movement speed, manipulation of their activity should impact motor output. To test this hypothesis, we used optogenetics to control activation of PVs and CHIs, while recording locomotion and neuronal activity from MSN and interneuron populations simultaneously. Specifically, the red-shifted, light-activated channelrhodopsin Chrimson 32 was expressed in PV or CHI interneurons using AAV-flex-Chrimson in PV-Cre or Chat-Cre mice. GCaMP6f was expressed in all striatal neurons as above using AAV-Syn-GCaMP6f. Mice were allowed to freely run on the spherical treadmill, while sparse periods (100 frames ~6 seconds) of optogenetic stimulation occurred at random every 25-55 seconds (see Figure 3A and Supplemental Methods). In PV-Cre mice, if optogenetic stimulation occurred when a mouse was already moving, there was no impact on speed; although stimulation did introduce a transient change in sideto-side directional movement on the spherical treadmill, similar to that seen during endogenous PV events (see supplemental methods, Figure S8A-B ; Video S4). Surprisingly, if optogenetic stimulation occurred when animals were at rest, we found that it was sufficient to trigger a transition to movement (Figure 3C ). PV-triggered movement bouts plateaued ~1-1.5 seconds after laser onset, consistent with the enhanced period of motor output we witnessed during endogenous PV events (Figure 2H, S2I ). Importantly, the same laser stimulation protocol had no impact on the behavior in PV-Cre control mice expressing only tdTomato (without Chrimson), or in Chat-Cre mice expressing Chrimson or tdTomato. Taken together, these results demonstrate that endogenous PV interneuron activity precedes motion onset and that their activation is sufficient to promote movement during periods of inactivity. Furthermore, our predictions regarding unique roles for each interneuron class in modulating behavior, based on the timing of calcium events from each cell class during voluntary movement, were confirmed by optogenetic manipulation of CHIs and PVs. Consistent with our Ca 2+ imaging analysis of CHIs, optogenetic stimulation of these cells was sufficient to cause the animal to reduce on-going movement (Figure 3B ) without altering direction (Figure S8 ). This effect was robust, and statistically significant when averaged across all optogenetic stimulation events (Figure 3B ). Furthermore, if CHI stimulation occurred when the mouse was at rest, it did not trigger new movement (Figure 3C ).The same laser stimulation protocol had no impact on the behavior in Chat-Cre control mice expressing only tdTomato in CHIs. The optogenetic results combined with the Ca 2+ imaging results from the endogenous activity in the CHIs described above suggest CHIs function to reduce velocity or terminate on-going bouts of locomotion (Figure 3B , Video S5). Characterization of coordinated MSN and interneuron activity Similar to other recent reports 12, 14 , we found that Ca 2+ dynamics in cells nearby one another (within 100μm) tended to be more correlated than those further away (Figure 4A , see also below 4E). Further, we found that correlations in fluorescence between cells varied by behavioral state (moving or at rest), and increased dramatically during high speed movement periods (Figure 4B ), likely due to the increase in Ca 2+ event rate observed in all neuron types described above (Figure 2B ). Finally, this effect of movement state on correlated neural activity was strongest amongst pairs of neurons situated close to one another (Figure 4C , see also Figure S9B ), in line with recent findings of spatially organized clusters of dorsal striatal neurons emerging during locomotion 12, 14 . In order to get a sense of the correlational structure of Ca 2+ dynamics between neurons, and control for the potential influence of changes in behavior on these relationships, we calculated asymmetric correlation coefficients 12, 33 between pairs of identified MSNs and interneurons. The pairwise correlation between MSN pairs was low (correlation=.08, Figure 4D ). When we considered the strength of MSN-MSN correlations by distance, we found, similar to recent studies, that the average correlation between MSNs decreased as the distance between cells increased (Figure 4E ), and only those in close proximity to one another were more correlated than chance. We further calculated the proportion of significantly correlated MSN pairs, and found that only a small subset of MSN pairs (~16%; Figure 4F ) exhibited such coordination. PVs however showed the highest degree of withinclass correlation across the three classes (Figure 4D-E ), although only ~25% of PV cells (Figure 4F ) were significantly correlated with one another. Unlike MSNs, correlated Ca 2+ activity between pairs of PV cells was not impacted by distance (Figure 4E ). In contrast, CHI pairs were characterized by the weakest within-class correlation and the fewest number of correlated pairs of the three neuron types (Figure 4D-F ). The strength of the correlation between CHIs, like PVs, did not vary by the distance between cells (Figure 4E ). Thus distance-dependent correlated activity appears to be a feature unique to MSN pairs during voluntary locomotion. Lastly we considered coordinated activity between MSNs and interneurons (Figure 5A ). Across all interneuron-MSN combinations, the proportion of correlated cell pairs decreased with distance, although this decline was sharpest for PV-MSN pairs (Figure 5A , middle), as reflected by the median distance between correlated cells (Figure 5B ). In contrast, distance had far less of an influence on correlated CHI-MSN pairs (Figure 5A , right), which were characterized by the largest median distance between related cell pairs (Figure 5B ). Combined, these findings are consistent with the prescribed roles of PV cells providing perisomatic inhibition to a local network of nearby MSNs 22 , whereas CHI interneurons appear to affect networks of MSNs over greater distances, perhaps via their extensive arborization 23, 34 . PVs and CHIs differentially predict movement and MSN activity Having characterized neural activity surrounding movement, determined a causal role of interneuron activity on movement, and defined the degree of correlated activity between neurons, we next sought to determine how each interneuron population coordinates MSN activity to control movement. To this end, we first created linear statistical models and tested the capacity of Ca 2+ dynamics in interneurons to predict changes in the global MSN population fluorescence. Because we found that the population fluorescence in the striatum was highly correlated with both speed and rotation (see Figures S2D, S2G , S9), we considered both factors in our model. We found that the small number of PV cells recorded during a session were equivalent to the power of either speed or rotation in predicting MSN population fluorescence (Figure 6A-B ). Since both endogenous and optogenetically evoked PV activity also coincided with changes in movement onset, we further examined whether PV activity could be used as a predictor of speed. We found that the predictive power of the small population of PV neurons (n=4.6) though slightly lower, was similar to that of the entire population of MSNs (n=244.2 neurons/session, Figure 6C-D ). In contrast to PVs, the population of CHIs (n=5.1 neurons/session) were weak predictors of both MSN population activity (Figure 6E-F ) and velocity (Figure 6G-H ). Importantly, we used regression models as the strength of the prediction for individual neurons would not be affected by whether neurons are positively or negatively modulated by movement. However, given the heterogeneity of CHI responses to motion onset, we conducted additional analyses that considered positive and negatively modulated CHI populations in isolation. We found that the positive and negatively populations did not differ from one another in their predictive relationship toward MSN activity (Figure S7I : left) or speed (Figure S7I : right). Thus, while CHI and PV neurons had similar representations in total number of neurons across recording sessions, only PV neurons were prominent predictors of both instantaneous striatal bulk fluorescence and locomotor output. PVs and CHIs modulate movement through unique effects on MSN activity While the predictive modeling described above demonstrates the extent to which interneuron activity can forecast MSN Ca 2+ dynamics and movement, it does not provide information on whether MSN population dynamics are impacted by changes in PV or CHI activity. Therefore, using the deconvolved calcium fluorescence signal (see Figure S10 and Methods) to align calcium events in each population, we next assessed how the activity within the population of MSNs changed when they coincided with PV or CHI events. Specifically, we compared MSN activity around interneuron events to MSN activity observed by chance around other randomly selected MSN events. We found that on average, MSN population fluorescence was lower than chance when associated with a PV calcium event (Figure 7A ), suggesting that PV activity could contribute to a decrease in the MSN population response. In contrast, MSN population fluorescence was elevated when coincident with a CHI calcium event (Figure 7B ), suggesting that CHI activity may activate or recruit the MSN population. Having revealed that interneuron activity coincides with changes in MSN fluorescence, we further considered if this change in fluorescence was a result of changes in coincident activity between MSN pairs. Specifically, we quantified the incidence of MSNs exhibiting coincident calcium events when interneurons are active compared to what would be expected by chance (see Supplemental Methods for details). We found MSN-MSN coactivity was reduced when aligned to PV events, relative to MSNs or CHIs (Figure 7C ). Thus the reduction in MSN fluorescence observed during PV activation was concomitant with a reduction in coincident events in the MSN population. When we performed the same analysis on the optogenetic stimulation sessions, we found that PV activation also reduced the MSN-MSN co-activity during laser on periods when compared to CHI stimulation or endogenous MSN-MSN co-activity (Figure 7D-E ). Further MSN population analysis revealed that optogenetic stimulation of PVs did not universally inhibit MSNs, but rather produced heterogeneous changes in MSN activity, including increases in activity in subpopulations of MSNs (Figure S4G ). The combined evidence suggests a model whereby PVs support specific movement plans by determining which MSNs are currently active 35 . In contrast, CHI events appeared to have had the opposite effect on the MSN population, and were associated with increased MSN-MSN co-activity; suggesting that CHIs may play a role in enhancing such coincident activity in the population of MSNs (Figure 7C ). In line with these observations, optogenetic stimulation of CHIs increased both MSN fluorescence (Figure S11B ), the probability of MSN activity (Figure S11F ) and MSN-MSN co-activity during laser on periods (Figure 7D-E ). To explore whether CHI-mediated enhancement of MSN-MSN co-activity might represent a mechanism underlying the capacity of CHIs to reduce on-going movement, we analyzed motor output during peaks in MSN-MSN coactivity. We found that MSN-MSN co-activity peaks were followed by significant reductions in motor output (Figure 7F ), mirroring the reductions in velocity seen in association with endogenous CHI activity (Figure 2H ) or optogenetic stimulation of CHIs (Figure 3B ). Together, our data support distinct and dissociable functions of PVs and CHIs in modulating MSNs to support voluntary movement. Optogenetic stimulation of PVs increased future movement, and given their superior capacity to predict MSN population fluorescence and speed, our data strongly supports a specific role for PVs in refining the populations of MSNs recruited during the execution of planned movement. In contrast, CHIs are poor predictors of instantaneous speed or MSN population activity. However, CHI activation is sufficient to reduce movement, an effect that was accompanied by enhanced coordinated activity in the MSN population. Such CHI-mediated MSN coordination represents a unique and previously unknown means by which striatal networks act to terminate on-going movement sequences. Discussion To begin to understand how PVs and CHIs modulate striatal MSN activity to support voluntary movement, we developed a large scale two-color imaging assay that enabled us to observe the activity of both interneurons and hundreds of surrounding MSNs in mice as they ran on a spherical treadmill. Because recent studies employing optical imaging to monitor activity in genetically defined D1 versus D2 MSNs did not differentiate these cell types from one another in healthy mice during spontaneous locomotion [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , we considered MSN populations as a single population in our analyses. Distinctions between D1 and D2 MSN activity have been described for goal directed vs habitual behaviors 36, 37 . However our data, in the context of other recent imaging studies [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , suggest that these distinctions likely reflect striatal network remodeling inherent to learning particular goal directed action sequences. Thus, while our studies specifically sought to characterize the role of two major interneuron populations in modulating general MSN activity and voluntary movement, future studies could uncover distinct influences of PV and CHI cells on direct or indirect pathway MSNs for different behaviors 30, 38 . We found evidence that both PVs and CHIs have activity-behavior relationships that are distinct from MSNs. While MSNs are topographically organized by their relationship to motor output as described previously 12, 14 , we found that neither PV nor CHI interneuron populations showed a similar anatomical specificity. Further we discovered that PV populations became active prior to MSNs at movement onset, and their calcium activity remains elevated throughout the duration of movement. PVs were also the best predictor of MSN population activity. Interestingly, both endogenous and optogenetically-triggered PV activity produced a reduction in the probability of coincident calcium events occurring in the MSN population. PV interneuron-mediated feedforward inhibition has been hypothesized as a potential mechanism for shutting down active MSNs that are not important for the currently activated motor plan 35 . Although PV cells can provide powerful and reliable feed-forward inhibition to nearby MSNs 19, 38 , our data suggests their activity largely coincides with periods of movement when MSNs are under the influence of strong excitatory cortical input, subcortical input, and dopamine release. As such, PV signals indeed may serve as an important component for "silencing" non-motor relevant MSNs to create a "de-noised" output condition to facilitate movement execution. This process could aid the selection of individual motor choices through reducing the activity of output neurons that are not integral to on-going behavior, and our data provide support for such a model. Furthermore, given the more narrow anatomical space over which PVs were correlated with MSNs, it is possible that specific subpopulations of PVs could be recruited to inhibit nearby MSNs to bias striatal output. Our finding that PV stimulation could spur new movement, and modulate the trajectory of ongoing movement suggests that ill-timed PV activation may be a prominent component of hyperkinetic movement disorders, whereas refined coordination of striatal activity by this population is important for specific movements 21, 39 . Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that PV cells play a major role in refining the activation of MSNs to modulate movement execution 21, 40 . Future studies will be needed to understand the mechanisms by which this process occurs, but recent evidence suggests that PV neurons can influence MSN networks through direct monosynaptic connections and larger scale di-synaptic circuit interactions 30 . In contrast to MSNs and PVs, increased activity in CHIs was associated with a reduction of ongoing locomotion. We found activity between CHIs was largely uncorrelated during voluntary movement; suggesting that the synchronized activity in CHIs observed in previous studies may be related to a specific response to salient environmental stimuli [41] [42] [43] . CHI activity did, however, coincide with recruitment and synchronization of MSNs (Figure 7C ), as well as reductions in velocity (Figure 2H ). Using optogenetics, we were able to completely recapitulate (Figure 3B , Figure 7D-E ) each of these findings illustrating that a major function for CHIs is to coordinate networks of MSNs to trigger the end of a movement bout, and this may represent a key mechanism for cholinergic modulation of motor control. Previous studies in striatal slices have revealed complex actions of acetylcholine in the striatum including both excitatory and inhibitory effects that can alter MSN activity states 24, 44 . The processes by which acetylcholine may organize MSN networks in vivo are less well understood, although the conditions associated with disease states provide insight. Elevated cholinergic tone has been hypothesized to contribute to Parkinson's disease symptoms, in particular akinesia and bradykinesia 28, 45 , and our results support the idea that augmented cholinergic activity in disease states may promote a pathological synchronization of striatal networks, freezing the dorsal striatum in a state that inhibits movement. The present data offer mechanistic insight into the therapeutic benefits of anti-cholinergic compounds in the treatment of Parkinson's disease 45, 46 and other motor disorders associated with elevated cholinergic tone 28 . As recent studies have implicated phasic dopamine release as a mechanism within the striatum to promote movement 47, 48 , our findings suggest that acetylcholine may act in opposition to this process. More specifically, striatal dopaminergic and cholinergic systems may act synergistically to promote or inhibit movements respectively, and balanced activation within these systems could be critical for the capacity of striatal networks to support dynamic behaviors. The results reported here specifically relate to striatal control of volitional movement, deficits in which are prominent features of several disorders. Interestingly, evidence suggests that goal-directed actions are often preserved in patients with neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease 2, 49, 50 . Thus identifying how MSN and interneuron populations interact to control self-generated locomotion is a crucial step in the effort to develop new treatments for a major, debilitating symptom of these disorders. Our data provide a foundation, and more broadly highlight that as potential therapies for movement disorders are explored, striatal function should not be considered as a monolithic whole, but rather a mosaic of projection cell networks differentially regulated by neuromodulators and local interneurons to support diverse functions. (A) Representative calcium events from the three types of neurons recorded; MSNs (top), PV cells (middle) and CHIs (bottom). (B) Calcium event rates during high versus low speed periods. Event rates for all neurons increased during periods of high movement speed (Signtest, MSN: sign=6999, n=7518, 237 ties, p=0; CHI: sign=43, n=47 neurons, 4 ties, p=2.78e-09; PV: sign=66, n=72 neurons, 7 ties, p=7.26e-14, across 28 sessions in 12 animals). (C) Calcium event shape assessed as area under the curve (AUC), with PVs' having the largest, and CHIs the smallest waveforms (Kruskal-Wallis, X 2 (2)=37.3, p=8.02e-09, n MSN =7727, n PV =78, n CHI =50; mean ranks: MSN: 3.92e+03, PV: 5.36e+03, CHI: 3.13e+03; Tukey's HSD post-hoc, PV vs MSN: p=7.58e-08, PV vs CHI, p=1.80e-07, MSN vs CHI: 0.038). This distinction was conserved during both high and low speed periods. MSNs also showed a small but significant increase in AUC between low and high speed movement periods, while PVs and CHIs were unchanged (Sign-test, MSN: sign=1190, n=1813 neurons, 0 ties, p=2.55e-40; CHI: sign=8, n=11 neurons, 0 ties, p=0. (Mixed-effects model; ANOVA for interaction of cell type and time bin: F(10,6.11e+06) = 9.52, p=4.91e-16; fluorescence for PVs at bin 1 (-1 to 0 seconds pre-peak): t(48198)=3.08, p =0.00278 vs baseline; fluorescence for MSNs -1 to 0 seconds following event, t(6.00e+06)=21.6, p=3.34e-103 vs baseline, fluorescence for CHIs 0-1 seconds following event, t(59244)=2.93, p=0.00428 vs baseline). (H) Normalized change in movement speed centered on calcium events sorted by cell class. Line plots and error bars indicate mean ⩲ SEM. Analysis revealed a significant interaction between time bin and cell type (Mixed-effects model, ANOVA F(8,39260)=3.61, p=0.00034), so comparisons were broken down by cell type. CHI calcium events were followed by a significant decrease in speed compared with events from the other two cell types. Comparisons of time windows to baseline, 0-500ms (CHIs: t(245)=-0.33, p=0.81; PVs: t(385)=-0.42, p=0.81; MSNs: t(38630)=5.0, p=1.9e-06); 500-1000ms (CHIs: t(245)= -2.0, p=0.089; PVs: t(385)=1.02, p=0.52; MSNs: t(38630)= -0.76, p=0.59), 1000-1500ms (CHIs: t(245)=-3.6, p=9.2e-04; PVs: t(385)=0.95, p=0.52; MSNs: t(38630)= -10.0, p=9.1e-23), 1500-2000ms (CHIs: t(245)=-4.68, p<0.001; PVs: t(385)= -0.19, p=0.85; MSNs: t(38630)=-18.4, p=3.83e-74) Benjamini-Hochberg corrected across all cell types and time bins (n=12 comparisons; n MSN =7727, n CHI =50, and n PV =78. A total of 30 cells out of 7855 did not produce an event that was included in this analysis, see methods for details; MSN, n=28 cells; PV, n=1 cell; CHI, n=1 cell). For all box plot figures, middle lines indicate the median, lower and upper edges of the box indicate quartiles below and above the median, and upper and lower whiskers indicate the points furthest from the median whose value did not exceed 1.5 times the first-to-third quartile range above the third quartile or below the first quartile. All sign-tests were two-sided. after peaks in MSN-MSN co-activity events (see supplemental methods), binned into 500ms windows for analysis. Error bars and center are mean ⩲ SEM. Peaks in MSN co-activity were followed by decreases in speed similar to that observed following CHI events, and CHI optogenetic stimulation (Friedman test, main effect of time, n=2249 peaks in coactivity, X 2 (8)=520, p<0.001; Tukey's HSD post-hoc, (vs 0-0.5 s) 0.5-1 seconds, p=0.030, 1.00-1.50 seconds, p=9.30e-07, 1.50-4.50 seconds, all p=8.97e-08; mean ranks: 5.81, 5.54, 5.35, 5.04, 4.84, 4.72, 4.62, 4.52, and 4.56).

The animal's position and movement were simultaneously acquired along with Ca 2+ imaging data. Right, Anatomical schematic showing placement of the imaging window for striatal recordings. (B) Imaging protocol.Recording sessions began with calcium imaging of GCaMP6f in the dorsal striatum using a 460nm illumination LED (left), followed by tdTomato imaging with a 567nm illumination LED (right).

(D) Mean population fluorescence of each cell class relative to movement onset. Line and shaded regions indicate the mean ⩲ SEM. (E) Quantification of the change in fluorescence between the pre-onset and post-onset windows around movement onset. All cell classes showed an increase in mean fluorescence from pre-onset, except CHIs (change from pre-onset; Sign-test, MSNs: sign=2540, n=7755 neurons from 12 mice, p=1.60e-202; CHIs: sign=25, n=51 neurons from 6 mice, p=1; PVs: sign=16, n=79 neurons from 6 mice, p=9.44e-08). In PVs, the increase in fluorescence around motion onset began 523.1±304.3ms before MSNs. Line plots and error bars indicate the mean ⩲ SEM. (F) Mean population fluorescence of each cell class relative to peak velocity. Line and shaded regions indicate the mean ⩲ SEM. (G) Quantification of fluorescence across the peak velocity time period. MSNs and PV cells when compared to baseline (2 seconds before peak velocity) showed significantly elevated fluorescence in the 1 second prior to peak velocity and in each 1 second time bin following. CHIs did not show significantly higher fluorescence until after peak velocity plateauing in the 1-2 second postpeak bin. Line plots and error bars indicate mean ⩲ SEM. Figure 3 : 3 Figure 3: Optogenetic Stimulation of Interneuron Populations Modulates Movement. (A) Simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and imaging experimental design. (top) Animals were imaged over 10-15 continuous minutes and received 13-23 trials of optogenetic stimulation with an ITI of 40±15seconds. Each trial consisted of 100 laser stimulation pulses at ~15 Hz. Red laser light was pulsed between GCaMP6f imaging frames.

(B) Normalized change in movement speed at laser onset for PV-Chrimson and Chat-Chrimson mice for all trials (n=4 PV-Chrimson mice, and n=4 Chat-Chrimson mice, 2 sessions for each mouse). Line plots and error bars indicate mean ⩲SEM. Significant reductions in speed coincided with laser onset only in Chat-Chrimson mice (Mixed-effects model, ANOVA: F(4,645)=6.7, p < 0.001; comparisons of time windows: 0-500ms; t(645)= -0.91, p=0.36, 500-1000ms; t(645)=-1.8, p=0.11, 1000-1500ms; t(645)=-3.8, p=6.2e-04; 1500-2000ms, t(645)=-3.6, p=8.1e-04. *=p<0.01, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected). This effect was not present in PV-Chrimson mice (Mixed-effects model, ANOVA: F(4,575)=1.4, p=0.24), or in control mice (n=4 PV-tDTomato mice, and n=4 Chat-tDTomato mice, 2 sessions for each mouse; PV-tDTomato mice: Mixed-effects model, ANOVA: F(4,580)=6.0, p=0.60; Chat-tDTomato mice: Mixedeffects model, ANOVA: F(4,580)=2.2, p=0.07). (C) Normalized change in movement speed following laser onset for PV-Chrimson and Chat-Chrimson mice when stimulation occurred during periods of low movement. Line plots and error bars indicate mean ⩲ SEM. Laser stimulation increased movement only in PV-Chrimson mice (Mixed-Effects Model, ANOVA F(4,200)=5.4, p=4.0e-04; baseline vs time=0-500ms: t(200)=3.16, p =0.0018; baseline vs time=500-1000ms: t(200)=4.3, p=6.2e-05; baseline vs time=1000-1500: t(200)=3.6, p=6.0e-04; baseline vs time=1500-2000 ms: t(200)=4.3, p=6.2e-05), but not in Chat-Chrimson mice (Mixed-effects model, ANOVA: F(4,130)=1.7, p=0.15) or in control mice Figure 4 : 4 Figure 4: Anatomical Clustering and Coordinated Activity within each Cell Population.

White lines represent boundaries between unique neuron pairs less than 100μm of one another. (B) Box plots of pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients during periods of high and low speed from all animals. Correlation between neuron pairs increased with speed (Sign-test, two-sided, sign=24, p=1.80e-04, n=28 sessions; high speed vs shuffled, sign=28, p=7.45e-09; low speed vs shuffled, sign=28, p=7.45e-09, high speed shuffled vs low speed shuffled: sign=21, n=28 sessions, p= 0.0125). (C) Difference in pairwise strength between periods of high and low movement sorted by anatomical distance across all cells from all sessions in all mice. The change in correlation strength was greatest between nearby cells (all two-sided sign-tests, sign-test, <100μm vs >100μm; sign=26, p=3.03e-06, n=28 sessions; sign-test, <100 μm vs <100 μm shuffled, sign=27, p=2.16e-07; sign-test, >100μm vs >100μm shuffled, sign=21, p=0.0125;). (D) Pairwise asymmetric correlation between the same cell types. Dotted lines indicate median of averaged correlation coefficients for within cell type shuffled data. PV cells showed the Figure 5 : 5 Figure 5: Coordinated Activity between Interneurons and MSNs by Anatomical Distance. (A) Population colormaps from all sessions in all animals showing significantly correlated cell pairs sorted by distance. Density distributions from above in the x-axis are shown below. MSN-MSN cell pairs (left) and MSN-Interneuron cell pairs (PV, middle; CHI, right). MSN-CHI cells are correlated over greater distances than MSN-MSN pairs, and MSN-PV are correlated over smaller distances than MSN-MSN pairs (MSN-MSN median = 411μms, MSN-PV: 343 μms, MSN-CHI: 448 μms; Kruskal-Wallis, X 2 (2)=303, n MSN-MSN =238293, n MSN-PV =4028, n MSN-CHI =2686, p=1.87e-66; mean ranks: MSN-MSN: 1.23e+05, MSN-PV: 1.04e+05, MSN-CHI: 1.31e+05; Tukey's HSD post-hoc, MSN-PV vs MSN-MSN: p=9.56e-10, MSN-PV vs MSN-CHI: p=9.56e-10, MSN-MSN vs MSN-CHI: p=9.53e-09).

(C) Measure of the expected values between the proportion of significantly correlated pairs for the MSN-MSN, MSN-PV, and MSN-CHI populations for those separated by a distance of >750 μm vs < 100 μm. Data >750 μm are plotted relative to <100 μm values. For all interneuron-MSN combinations, the proportion of correlated pairs decreased as the distance between cells increased, though the decrease in CHI-MSN pairs Figure 6 : 6 Figure 6: PVs, but not CHIs, are Strong Predictors of Speed and MSN Population Activity. (A) Striatal population fluorescence (blue, top, and gray in the bottom four) and predicted fluorescence based on the PV activity (orange), or an equivalent number of MSNs (teal) from a representative PV-Cre mouse. (B) Quantification across all PV-Cre mice. Predictions of population fluorescence were compared to that derived from using motor output (rotation: purple; speed: black). PV Ca +2 dynamics were better predictors than that of an equivalent number of MSNs, and similar to speed and rotation Friedman test, X 2 (3)=18.0, p=4.47e-04, n=17 sessions in 6 mice; mean ranks: speed: 2.94, rotation: 2.53, PV: 3.12, MSN: 1.41; posthoc Tukey's HSD, speed vs PV: p=1.0, rotation vs PV: p=0.54; PV vs. MSNs, p=6.8e-04. (C) Actual speed and predicted speed based on PV cell activity or MSN activity for a representative PV mouse. Experimentally measured speed is plotted in black (top), and gray (bottom three), compared with predicted velocity using the activity of a single PV (orange), a single MSN (light blue) and the full population MSNs activity (dark blue). (D) Quantification of the population predictor performance across all PV-Cre mice. The ability of the full PV population from each recording session to predict speed was also compared to an equivalent number of MSNs (n=4.6±0.86 PV cells across 17 sessions with at least 1 PV cell, mean±SEM), referred to as "sub-population". The activity of a single PV was a significant predictor of speed, and the small population of PVs has equal predicting power speed as the entire population of MSNs (Friedman test, X 2 (4)=50.1, p=3.51e-10; mean ranks: single MSN: 1.32, multiple MSN: 2.56, all MSN: 4.94, multiple PV: 3.56, single PV: 2.62, n=17 sessions; Tukey's HSD post-hoc: MSN all-MSN single: p=1.01e-08; MSN all- Figure 7 : 7 Figure 7: Interneurons Regulate MSN Activity and Movement State. (A) MSN population fluorescence aligned to all PV calcium event onsets (orange) versus MSN calcium event onsets (blue) from all PV-Cre animals. MSN population peak fluorescence was significantly reduced in the 500ms following a PV calcium event (PV postevent: rank-sum test, two-sided, ranksum=2.43e+12 n PV =237528 event-neurons, n MSN =20289773 event-neurons, across all 6 PV animals and 18 sessions, p=1.48e-06), in comparison to a MSN calcium event (blue). Plots are mean ±SEM. (B) Same as (A) but for Chat-Cre animals. MSN peak population fluorescence was significantly elevated in the 500ms following a CHI calcium event (green: Chat-Cre post-event: two-sided, rank-sum test, ranksum=1.73e+12, p=2.53e-09, n MSN =22116844 event-neurons, n CHI =153680 eventneurons from 10 sessions in 6 animals), compared to an MSN event (blue). (C) Change in coincident MSN activity (MSN co-activity) following a MSN calcium event (blue), a PV calcium event (orange), or a CHI calcium event (green) from all animals and normalized to event onset for all three types (t=0). Plots are mean ±SEM. A magnified inset demonstrating the change in MSN co-activity probability in the 100ms following a MSN, PV or CHI calcium event is shown to the right. Following a CHI calcium event, there is an increase in MSN co-activity, whereas following a PV calcium event, there is a reduction in MSN coactivity relative to the change in MSN-triggered co-activity (Pairwise two-sided z-tests, PV-MSN vs CHI-MSN, z=-40.8, p=0; PV-MSN vs MSN-MSN, z=-47, p=0; CHI-MSN vs MSN-MSN, z=20.4, p=0. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc for multiple comparisons; raw proportions: MSN: 3.52e-03, PV:2.30e-03, CHI:5.91e-03,n CHI =38189238, n CHI =38189238 event-pairs, n MSN =9644946557 event-pairs, n PV =48285061 event-pairs, across all 12 animals and 28 sessions).

Introduction A prominent feature of cortical neurons is that their responses to stimuli are quite malleable, depending upon a host of factors. For instance, the global structure of a sensory scene activates surround receptive fields, normalizing the response of cortical neurons to their preferred stimuli (Adesnik et al., 2012; Carandini and Heeger, 2012; Reynolds and Heeger, 2009; Vinje and Gallant, 2000) . Alternatively, top-down projections can also mediate how cortical responses change with directed attention (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009; Ruff et al., 2018 ), subject arousal (McGinley et al., 2015) , or task engagement (Downer et al., 2015) . On the whole, these neuronal response shifts are reliably signaled by changes in neuronal firing rates (Carandini and Heeger, 2012; Harris and Thiele, 2011; Niell and Stryker, 2010; Ruff et al., 2018) , the spectral content of local field potentials (Harris and Thiele, 2011; Niell and Stryker, 2010) as well as single neuron membrane potentials (Poulet and Petersen, 2008) , and finally the magnitude of spike train correlations across a population (Doiron et al., 2016) . These observations have prompted studies that focus on how inhibitory circuits are key mediators of cortical state modulations. Indeed, inhibition has been implicated in the suppression of neuronal activity (Adesnik, 2017; Adesnik et al., 2012; Haider et al., 2013; Kato et al., 2017) , gain control of pyramidal neuron firing rates (Ferguson and Cardin, 2020; Katzner et al., 2011; Phillips and Hasenstaub, 2016; Silver, 2010) and correlated neuronal fluctuations (Okun and Lampl, 2008) , rhythmic population activity (Atallah and Scanziani, 2009; Womelsdorf et al., 2014) , and spike timing of pyramidal neurons (Berman and Maler, 1998; Wehr and Zador, 2003) . However, inhibition must also prevent runaway cortical activity that would otherwise lead to pathological activity (Haider et al., 2013; Ozeki et al., 2009; Veit et al., 2017) , enforcing constraints on how inhibition can modulate pyramidal neuron activity. In sum, using inhibitory interactions to expose the physiological and circuit basis for how cortical activity changes depending upon processing or cognitive needs has been a longstanding and popular avenue of study (Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011) . While inhibition has been long measured (Eccles et al., 1954; Hartline et al., 1956; Lloyd, 1946) , the past fifteen years have witnessed a newfound appreciation of its diversity. The invention and widespread use of cell-specific labeling and optogenetic control (Fenno et al., 2011) , combined with the detailed genetic and physiological characterization of cortical interneurons (Jiang et al., 2015; Markram et al., 2004) has painted a complex picture of a circuit that was previously considered to be simpler (Douglas et al., 1989) . The standard cortical circuit now includes (at a minimum) somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneuron classes, with distinct synaptic interactions between these classes as well as with pyramidal neurons (Jiang et al., 2015; Kepecs and Fishell, 2014; Pfeffer et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2016) . This new circuit reality presents some clear challenges (Cardin, 2018; Ferguson and Cardin, 2020; Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016; Wood et al., 2017; Yavorska and Wehr, 2016) , foremost being to uncover how state changes that were previously associated with inhibition in a broad sense, should be distributed over these diverse interneuron classes. An attractive hypothesis is that SOM and PV interneurons are within-group functionally homogeneous, yet each class performs functions that are distinct from those of the other classes (Hattori et al., 2017; Kepecs and Fishell, 2014; Wang et al., 2004) . In line with this idea, early optogenetic studies of PV and SOM neurons in the mouse visual cortex showed differential multiplicative and subtractive modulations of excitatory neuron responses (Atallah et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2012) . However, such tidy arithmetic of inhibitory modulation is likely an over-abstraction, and a detailed analysis of data from the auditory cortex shows a mixed modulatory influence of both SOM and PV interneurons (Seybold et al., 2015) . Another popular functional distinction between interneuron classes is their roles in disinhibitory cortical circuits (Fu et al., 2014; Large et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2013; Pi et al., 2013; Wang and Yang, 2018) , specifically when one interneuron class inhibits another class and thereby releasing pyramidal neurons from a source of inhibition. Yet inhibition can be complicated to dissect in the full cortical circuit. For instance, the SOM → E inhibitory pathway competes with the SOM → PV → E disinhibitory pathway for pyramidal neuron (E) influence. This competition could underlie differences in how SOM neurons suppress pyramidal neuron activity in layer 2/3 of visual and auditory cortex (Adesnik, 2017; Adesnik et al., 2012; Kato et al., 2017) yet increase activity in layer 4 of somatosensory cortex (Xu et al., 2013) . These difficulties in interpretation likely arise from an incomplete analysis: selected feedforward sub motifs within the full recurrent circuit are considered, yet with a tacit ignorance of the other pathways that will nevertheless still contribute to the cortical response. A proper untangling of the complexity of a fully recurrent cortical circuit requires a modeling framework where a rigorous analysis can be performed. Cortical models with both excitatory and inhibitory pathways have a long history of study (Griffith, 1963; Wilson and Cowan, 1972) . Models with just a single inhibitory interneuron class have successfully explained a wide range of cortical behavior; from contrast dependent nonlinearities in cortical response (Ozeki et al., 2009; Rubin et al., 2015) , to the genesis of irregular and variable spike discharge (Brunel and Hakim, 1999; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996) , and finally to the mechanisms underlying high-frequency cortical network rhythms (Bos et al., 2016; Wang, 2010) . On the surface, it may seem surprising that cortical models that ignore inhibitory diversity can nevertheless account for such a range of cortical behavior. However, these models are often designed to capture only a single aspect of cortical responses, and rarely do they account for how a set of neuronal correlates (firing rates, response gain, neuronal correlations, etc.) shift with the cortical state. In truth, perhaps the most compelling reason that theorists lag behind the reality of a diverse interneuron cortical circuit is that there are serious complications in model analysis when multiple interneuron classes are introduced. Indeed, the set of model parameters and the landscape of possible solutions both increase dramatically with the addition of new neuron classes. In total, there is a real need for a cogent analysis of the behavior of multi-interneuron cortical circuits models. We present a circuit theory for previously developed multi-interneuron cortical circuit models (del Molino et al., 2017; Kuchibhotla et al., 2017; Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016; Mahrach et al., 2020; Veit et al., 2017) with the goal of giving a mechanistic understanding of how diverse inhibitory interneurons participate in the circuit level modulation of cortical responses. In particular, we consider modulatory inputs to SOM neurons which aim to shift the operative state of the full E -PV -SOM neuron circuit. We expose a circuit-based relationship between how SOM neuron modulations co-determine network stability and response gain. More to the point, the underlying E -PV -SOM circuit supports a division of labor (Wang et al., 2004) , whereby PV neurons are well-positioned to provide network stability, allowing SOM neurons the freedom to modulate response gain. Our theoretical framework offers an attractive platform to probe how interneuron circuit structure determines gain and stability which may generalize well beyond the sensory cortices where these interneuron circuits are currently best characterized. Results The inhibitory and disinhibitory pathways of the E -PV -SOM circuit There is strong in vivo evidence that SOM interneurons play a critical role in the modulation of cortical response (Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016; Yavorska and Wehr, 2016) . However, the complex wiring between excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Jiang et al., 2015; Pfeffer et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2016) presents a challenge when trying to expose the specific mechanisms by which SOM neurons modulate cortical response. Two distinct inhibitory circuit pathways are often considered when disentangling the impact of SOM inhibition on pyramidal neuron (E) response. We introduce these pathways with a pair of studies that are emblematic of these circuit motifs. In the first line of study, SOM neuron activity in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex was recruited by expanding the spatial scale of an orientated drifting grating visual stimulus (Adesnik, 2017; Adesnik et al., 2012) . This resulted in decreased activity of putative layer 2/3 E neurons whose spatial receptive field was in the center of a visual image. The simplest interpretation is that the increased SOM activity inhibited E neurons via direct SOM → E connectivity. Similar suppression of E neuron response from direct SOM inhibition has been implicated in other studies (Wang and Yang, 2018) , and a disinhibition of SOM → E projections is often mediated through vasoactive intestinal-peptide (VIP) neurons projections to SOM neurons (Fu et al., 2014; Pi et al., 2013) . In the second study, layer 4 SOM neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex were optogenetically silenced (Xu et al., 2013) . This resulted in increased activity of PV neurons, and a subsequent decreased activity of E neurons. The authors intuited a suppression of the disinhibitory pathway SOM → PV → E as the source of reduced E neuron activity. Taken together, the pair of studies seem in opposition to one another, with SOM neuron activity providing either a source or a relief of E neuron suppression. This response dichotomy prompted us to consider what physiological and circuit properties of the E -PV -SOM circuit are critical determinants of whether an increase in SOM neuron activity results in an increase or a decrease in E neuron response. An answer to this question requires consideration of the full recurrent connectivity within the E -PV -SOM neuron circuit, as opposed to analysis restricted to just the SOM → E and SOM → PV → E sub motifs within the circuit. Fortunately, there is a detailed physiological characterization of the specific connectivity patterns of inhibitory subtypes within the cortical circuit (Jiang et al., 2015; Pfeffer et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2016) . Briefly, PV neurons couple strongly to other PV neurons as well as to E neurons, while SOM neurons connect strongly to PV and E neurons, but not to other SOM neurons. Finally, both PV and SOM neurons receive inputs from E neurons. We incorporate these circuit details in a network of leaky integrate-and-fire model neurons where the E, PV, and SOM subclasses are represented (Fig. 1A ; see Methods 1.1). The simplicity of the spiking dynamics makes our model amenable to a mean-field reduction which captures the bulk spiking activity of each subpopulation of neurons (where r E , r P , and r S denote the E, PV, and SOM populations respectively; see Methods 1.2), as has been done by similar studies of the E -PV -SOM cortical circuit (del Molino et al., 2017; Kuchibhotla et al., 2017; Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016; Mahrach et al., 2020) . A, Sketch of the network model with neuron class-specific connections motivated by (Pfeffer et al., 2013) . A modulatory input (black line) is applied to the SOM neurons. This input results in a change in the SOM neuron population firing rate (δr S ; green line), which in turn causes a change of excitatory neuron activity (δr E ; red line). Assuming a linear relation between δr S and δr E allows δr E to be determined by summing over all possible pathways through the network by which SOM activity can influence E activity (see Eq. ( 23 )). B, The relation between δr S and δr E after summing over all paths (see Eq. ( 26 )). Sketches visualizes the tradeoff between the inhibitory and disinhibitory pathways. J κγ summarizes the number and strength of connections from population γ to population κ (κ ,γ ∈ {E, P, S}, see Eq. ( 7 )); β κ denotes the cellular gain of population κ (see Eq. ( 16 )), and W EP the effective connectivity matrix between the E and PV populations (see Eq. ( 17 )). Using our model we ask how a modulation of the SOM neuron activity, resulting in r S → r S + δr S , is transferred to a modulation of E neuron activity yielding r E → r E +δr E (Fig. 1A , green and red inset timeseries). If δr S is sufficiently small we can linearize around a given dynamical state of the model so that δr E = L ES δr S , where L ES is the transfer coefficient between SOM and E neuron modulations. In principle L ES depends on the synaptic matrix J that defines the coupling between neuron classes, as well as the cellular gain, β, of all neurons classes (see Methods 1.3). Since the neuron transfer is nonlinear (see Eq. ( 10 )), the β values, and by extension L ES , depend upon the operating point of the network. While L ES is straightforward to compute (del Molino et al., 2017; Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016) it can be cumbersome, and extracting clear insight about how J and β influence modulation can be difficult. It is instructive to express L ES as a sum over all possible synaptic pathways by which SOM neuron activity can influence E neuron activity (Fig. 1A , right; see Eq. ( 23 )). Fortunately, this sum can be simplified so that just two network motifs determine the sign of L ES (Fig. 1B ; see Methods 1.3). These motifs reflect both the disinhibitory component of the network (the SOM → PV → E connections, labeled pathway p I in Fig. 1B ) and the inhibitory component (the PV → PV and SOM → E connections, labeled pathway p II in Fig. 1B ). Interestingly, these motifs corresponds to the pathways evoked in our motivating pair of experimental studies (p I in (Xu et al., 2013) and p II in (Adesnik et al., 2012) ). The net pathway is a tradeoff between these two motifs, where p I vies for disinhibition (L ES > 0) while p II vies for inhibition (L ES < 0). Whether the full motif is inhibitory or disinhibitory depends (somewhat expectantly) on the three connection strengths J EP , J PS , and J ES (J EP is the synaptic strength of the PV → E neuron pathway; the other connections have the same nomenclature). However, what is unexpected is that it also depends on the recurrent strength between PV neurons, J PP (the β P J PP term in pathway p II ). Further, since β P depends on the operating point of the network then the tradeoff between the two pathways can be controlled by PV neuron modulation. In particular, since β P increases with r P then L ES can transition from effectively inhibitory for low PV activity (small β P ) to effectively disinhibitory for higher PV activity (large β P ). However, this is only possible if the combined SOM → PV and PV → E connections are stronger than the combined PV → PV and SOM → E connections. We remark that other connections and the activity of the excitatory and SOM neurons only contribute to the amplitude of the effective pathway (as reflected in the prefactor in Fig. 1B ). Thus, changing the activity of E and SOM neurons does not explicitly change the sign of L ES . Pfeffer et al. (Pfeffer et al., 2013) report that in L2/3 and L5 of the mouse visual cortex the SOM → E connection is stronger than the SOM → PV connection, while the connections from PV → E neurons and PV → PV neurons are comparably strong. Given these facts, our analysis suggests that the inhibitory pathway p II outweighs the disinhibitory pathway p I , so that L ES < 0. This is consistent with the SOM suppression of E neuron activity by large drifting gratings reported by Adesnik et al. (Adesnik et al., 2012) in L2/3 of mouse visual cortex. Alternatively, Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2013) find stronger SOM → PV than SOM → E connections in L4 mouse somatosensory cortex. However, since the relative strength of the PV → E and PV → PV connection strengths are unknown, our analysis cannot predict whether the effective pathway is inhibitory or disinhibitory. In sum, while the full E -PV -SOM recurrent circuit invokes a multitude of polysynaptic pathways, a tradeoff between the two central disynaptic pathways often appealed to in literature, p I and p II , does indeed determine the modulatory influence of SOM neurons upon E neurons. Having now identified the central role of these two pathways, in the following sections we investigate how they control the stimulus -response gain of E neurons. Comparison of gain modulation by the two inhibitory pathways Gain modulation refers to changes in the sensitivity of neuron activity to changes in a driving input (Ferguson and Cardin, 2020; Silver, 2010; Williford and Maunsell, 2006) . Typically, the driving input is a feature of a sensory scene and individual neuron responses show tuning to specific feature value. In a later section we will consider gain modulation of tuned responses, but to begin we simply consider a homogeneous input (I stim ) that targets both E and PV neurons (Tremblay et al., 2016) , and we compute the E neuron network gain as the dr E /dI stim (Eq. ( 27 )). Here, network gain measures the sensitivity of r E owing to the activity of the full recurrent circuit in response to a change in I stim . This is opposed to the cellular gain β E which measures the sensitivity of r E to a change in the full input current to E neurons due to both the external stimulus and internal interactions. Our circuit model allows us to compare and contrast the effectiveness of network gain modulation via the disinhibitory pathway from SOM → PV → E neurons (p I ; Fig. 2Ai ) to modulation via the direct SOM → E pathway (p II ; Fig. 2Bi ). In what follows we explore the E -PV -SOM circuit with both simulations of populations of integrate-and-fire model neurons (Methods 1.1) as well as an associated firing rate model (Methods 1.2). We first address modulation via the disinhibitory pathway p I with SOM neurons being depolarized by a modulatory input (I mod > 0). Examples such a modulation include suppressed VIP inhibition onto SOM neurons (Pi et al., 2013) , activation of pyramidal cells located outside the circuit yet preferentially projecting to SOM neurons (Adesnik et al., 2012) , and direct cholinergic modulation of SOM neurons (Kuchibhotla et al., 2017; Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016) . Modulations that increase SOM neurons activity (Fig. 2Aii , green) suppress the activity of PV neurons (Fig. 2Aii , blue), thereby removing inhibition from E neurons and increasing their firing rates (Fig. 2Aii, red ). For small modulations (I mod < 15 Hz), the slight increase in E neuron firing rates causes an increase in E neuron network gain by increasing cellular gain β E (Fig. 2Aiii , black). For larger modulations (I mod > 20 Hz), PV neuron firing rates increase due to increased excitatory feedback from E → PV neurons which overcomes the feedforward inhibition of the SOM → PV neuron pathway. The switch from suppressed PV activity to enhanced PV activity marks the transition of the E -PV sub-circuit from a non-inhibition stabilized network (non-ISN) to an inhibition stabilized network (ISN) (Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016; Ozeki et al., 2009; Tsodyks et al., 1997) . In the ISN state, the recurrently coupled E neurons are not stable by themselves but are stabilized by recurrent inhibition from PV neurons. Our firing rate model predicts that increased recurrent inhibition also suppresses network response to input and can decrease E neuron network gain for sufficiently strong modulations (Fig. 2Aiii , black curve). The maximum in response gain occurs after the network has transitioned to the ISN regime (see Methods 1.4). At high values of modulatory input (I mod > 30 Hz) there is a severe disagreement between the firing rates and network gain obtained with the integrate-and-fire neuron simulations compared to those from analysis of the firing rate model (Fig. 2Aiii , compare points to the curve). The firing rate description assumes near Poisson spiking dynamics and negligible correlations between neuron spike trains (Methods 1.2). Thus, the discrepancy between theory and simulations hints at a shift in the spiking network dynamics away from the asynchronous irregular regime (Brunel, 2000; Renart et al., 2010) . Indeed, while the population spike times of the E neurons in the integrate-and-fire simulations show irregular spiking for low modulation (Fig. 2Aiv, top) , this gives way to more synchronous activity when reaching maximal gain (Fig. 2Aiv , middle) and eventually pathologic synchronous population bursts for large modulation (Fig. 2Aiv , bottom). Past modeling work has shown how fast recurrent inhibition within a cortical circuit can maintain an asynchronous spiking dynamic (Huang et al., 2019; Renart et al., 2010; Tetzlaff et al., 2012) . Thus, it is to be expected that suppressing the normally strong recurrent PV inhibition via pathway p I will lead to a breakdown of the asynchronous state that is supported in the E -PV subcircuit. In total, modulation of E neuron network gain through the disinhibitory pathway p I is restricted to only sufficiently weak modulations. The stimulus targets E and PV neurons and modulatory input targets SOM neurons. A, Disinhibition via SOM→PV→E: ii) Stationary population firing rates of excitatory neurons (red), PV neurons (blue) and SOM neurons (green) dependent on modulation of the SOM neurons. Dots correspond to simulation results of populations of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons (Methods 1.1). Solid lines denote analytical predictions obtained from mean-field theory (Eq. ( 13 )). iii) Gain of excitatory neurons (black, Eq. ( 27 )) depending on the modulation of SOM neurons.

B Inhibition via SOM → E: ii-iv) as in A. Parameters: p PS = 0.1 (I), p PS = 0 (II), p ES = 0 (I), p ES = 0.1 (II), p SE = 0 (I, II), p ext,inh S varies between 0.0225 and 0.00675 in (I) and between 0.01125 and 0.0225 in (II) (see also Eq. ( 8 ), p ext,inh E = 0.01 (I). Aii In the second pathway, p II , SOM neurons project directly to E neurons, so we consider modulations that inhibit SOM neurons (I mod < 0) and result in net disinhibition of E neurons. Consequently, E neurons increase their firing rates and then drive PV neurons to increased rates (Fig. 2Bii ). Through-out the modulation E neuron network gain increases monotonically from low to high values (Fig. 2Biii ). Further, network dynamics remain in the asynchronous, irregular spiking regime (Fig. 2Biv ). Indeed, this asynchrony permits the firing rate model theory to match the integrate-and-fire simulations across low and high gain values (Fig. 2Biii , compare points to the curve). Thus, in contrast to the modulation through inhibitory pathway p I , pathway p II supports a network gain increase that is robust throughout the modulation range. In summary, these initial examples show that inhibitory modulations via the indirect SOM → PV → E and direct SOM → E pathways and are quite distinct. There is a clear need to establish a more nuanced view on how diverse inhibition controls network gain and stability; this is the central goal of our study. Towards this end, in the next section, we formalize the relations between gain and stability in simple cortical networks with only one inhibitory class. This will provide us a platform to build a broader theory in E -PV -SOM circuits, which will be the focus of the later sections. Gain and stability modulation are opposed in E -PV circuits In order to provide insight in how stability and network gain are co-affected by a modulation we first consider a reduced E -PV circuit (Fig. 3B ) where stimuli target both E and PV neurons I stim = (I E stim , I P stim ) T . For this circuit the network gain is (Methods 1.3): g E ≡ dr E dI stim = β E (1 + β P J PP )I E stim -β P J EP I P stim det(1 -W) . (1) The first term on the right-hand side (in the numerator) describes how E neuron response is amplified by the network, while the second one describes response cancellation by PV neurons. Since the cellular gains β E and β P depend upon the operating point from which the circuit dynamics is linearized, the tradeoff between amplification and cancellation can be controlled through an external modulation that shifts this point. To compare network gain across different network states we consider a grid of possible firing rates (r E , r P ). A given network state is found by numerically determining the external input required to position the network at that rate (see Eq. ( 9 )). For each network state we linearize the network dynamics (i.e. determine the βs) and compute the network gain via Eq. (1) (see heatmap in Fig. 3A ). It is immediately apparent that network gain is largest for high r E and low r P , and smallest vice versa. Gain modulation is most effective when it connects two network states which are orthogonal to a line of constant gain (gain isolines in Fig. 3A ). Thus, for most network states the highest gain increase occurs for modulations that increase E neuron rates while simultaneously decreasing PV neuron rates. Unstable firing rate dynamics are typified by runaway activity, when recurrent excitation is not stabilized by recurrent inhibition (Griffith, 1963; Ozeki et al., 2009; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996; Wilson and Cowan, 1972) . In networks of spiking neurons, this instability can manifest as network-wide synchronized, oscillatory dynamics (as observed in Fig. 2Aiv ). To quantify these frequency-dependent state transitions we use a stability measure defined as the minimal distance (across oscillatory frequency) to the transition between stable and unstable oscillatory dynamics (see Methods 1.5). As was done for network gain we consider how stability depends on network activity (r E , r P ) about which the network is linearized (color in Fig. 3C ). Network dynamics are most stable for large PV and low E neuron rates (the white region in Fig. 3C ). For higher E rates the recruited PV activity gives rise to larger amplitude network oscillations, and as a result the distance to instability decreases (the orange region in Fig. 3C ). Finally, for sufficiently large E and small PV rates, the network transitions into fully unstable firing rate dynamics (black lines in Fig. 3A, C ). This analysis of gain and stability reveals an inverse relationship between these two network features (compare Fig. 3A and C ). This is evident by plotting a near constant gain for (r E , r P ) ranging over a stability isoline (Fig. 3D ). Further, over a large region of (r E , r P ) we observe that higher gain is accompanied by lower stability (Fig. 3A, C ). This connection arises because the recurrent E → PV → E loop enforces both a dynamic cancellation required to stabilize network activity (Ozeki et al., 2009; Renart et al., 2010; Tetzlaff et al., 2012) as well as a cancellation that attenuates E neuron response to I stim (Stern et al., 2018; Sutherland et al., 2009) . Thus, any modulation that increases network gain in the E -PV circuit will necessarily result in a less stable network. 9 )). Different fixed points correspond to different external inputs to the populations. The color denotes the network gain (Eq. ( 1 )) of the system at the given fixed point. Lines of constant gain are shown in gray (from dark to light gray normalized gain 0.1 to 0.7 in steps of 0.1). The black line marks where the deterministic rate dynamics become unstable. Parameter combinations for which no fixed point could be found are set to maximum gain and minimum stability. B, Sketch of the model containing E and PV neurons and a stimulus that targets both populations. C, Same as in A but the color denotes how close the system operates to instability (Eq. ( 35 )). The deterministic rate dynamics becomes unstable at distance (d min ) zero. Stability isolines are plotted in gray (from dark to light gray: d min = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9). D, Gain along stability isolines of d min = 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9. Parameters: p ES = p PS = p SE = 0, p ext E and p ext P vary on each point of the grid in A and C. These results prompt the question: can a cortical circuit be modulated through inhibition to a higher gain regime without compromising network stability? In the next section, we investigate whether direct modulation of SOM neurons can shift the E -PV -SOM circuit from a low to a high gain state while stability is maintained. Gain and stability are differentially mediated by SOM and PV neurons Our initial exploration of the full E -PV -SOM circuit showed that while disinhibition through pathway p I (SOM → PV → E) can modulate network gain it also destabilizes circuit activity. In contrast, disinhibition through pathway p II (SOM → E) ensured a stable asynchronous state throughout modulation (Fig. 2 ). However, our analysis was restricted to a network with a single unmodulated state, and it remains to show that this result is general over a wide range of network states. To simplify our analysis we neglect the E → SOM connections in the full E -PV -SOM circuit (Fig. 4 , left column). Consequently, SOM neuron modulation can only affect the stability and gain of E neurons by changing the dynamical state of the E -PV subcircuit. Positive or negative input modulations to SOM neurons increase or decrease their steady-state firing rate, which in turn affects the steady-state rates of the E and PV neurons (Fig. 4Ai ,ii). A specific modulation can be visualized as a vector (∆r E , ∆r P ) in the previously introduced (r E , r P ) firing rate grid (Fig. 4Aiii ). The direction of the vector indicates where the E -PV network state would move to if SOM neurons are weakly modulated. We remark that the modulation (∆r E , ∆r P ) not only depends on the feedforward SOM projections to E and PV neurons, but also on the dynamical regime (i.e linearization) of the unmodulated state (r E , r P ). To build intuition we first consider only the SOM → PV connection and set the SOM → E connection to zero, thereby isolating pathway p I (Fig. 2Ai ). A depolarizing modulation to SOM neurons is applied (I mod > 0), ultimately causing ∆r E > 0 through PV neuron disinhibition. If the unmodulated network state has low r E and high r P then the modulation vector field shows a transition from non-ISN to ISN dynamics, indicated by ∆r P < 0 for low r E yet shifting to ∆r P > 0 for larger r E (Fig. 4Bi ,ii). In this regime, the modulation vectors cross the gain isolines, and network gain robustly increases over a wide range of initial (r E , r P ) network states (Fig. 4Bii ). However, the vectors also cross the stability isolines, showing that the modulation compromises network stability (Fig. 4Bi ). If we extend our analysis by including weak SOM → E connectivity (Fig. 4Ci ,ii), the SOM → PV connection continues to dominate and maintains a disinhibitory effect on E neurons. The vector field changes so that the modulation now strongly increases gain but also shifts the circuit more directly into the unstable region. Note also that the response reversal of the PV neurons at the transition from non-ISN to ISN has vanished. In total, disinhibition through pathway p I has the general property that increased gain comes at the cost of decreased stability. We next consider the modulation of E neuron activity via removal of direct SOM mediated inhibition through pathway p II . To begin we set the SOM → PV connection to zero (Fig. 4C ) and consider an external hyperpolarizing modulation of SOM neurons (I mod < 0). This results in ∆r E > 0, which in turn gives ∆r P > 0 through the E → PV connection (Fig. 4Di ,ii). The vector field crosses gain isolines at low r E values, but aligns with a them at high r E (Fig. 4Dii ). That means that a modulation yields gain increases for low network activity but loses its effectiveness at high activity. However, the vector field also shows how the modulation aligns with the stability isolines at high r E , indicating that stability is not comprised by modulation. Finally, including the SOM → PV connection shows that the arrow field aligns with a lower stability isoline (Fig. 4Ei ). The high gain state is, therefore, more stable, but at the price of a smaller overall gain increase (Fig. 4Eii ). In sum, our analysis shows that if PV neurons stabilize E neuron activity then increasing the gain of E neurons by inhibiting PV neurons drives the network dynamics towards instability. By contrast, shifting the network to a high gain state by removing SOM inhibition from the E neurons yields rate increases of both the E and PV neurons and a stable high gain state. The network stability is improved if SOM neurons project to both E and PV neurons. In total, our analysis supports the simple idea that interneurons that stabilize network activity should not be involved in the modulation of network gain. Recurrent feedback from E to SOM neurons amplifies gain modulation Neglecting the E → SOM connection in the E -PV -SOM circuit makes SOM activity simply an intermediate step in a feedforward modulation of the E -PV subcircuit. In this section, we consider how the recurrent E ↔ SOM interactions determine how an external modulation to SOM neurons affects E neuron gain. First, in the absence of E → SOM coupling, we consider the network in three conditions: nonstimulated (NSt), stimulated (St), or modulated and stimulated (M+St). In the NSt condition E and PV neuron activity is low (Fig. 5Ai ,ii; left bars), while SOM neurons are moderately activity (Fig. 5Aiii ; left bar). In the St condition a depolarizing stimulus (I stim > 0) is given to the E and PV neurons and their activity naturally increases (Fig. 5Ai ,ii; middle bars). However, since E neurons do not project to SOM neurons then SOM activity in the S condition remains the same as in the NS condition (Fig. 5Aiii ; middle bar). Finally, in the M+St condition a hyperpolarizing modulation (I mod < 0) is applied to the SOM neurons in conjunction with I stim > 0 to both E and PV neurons. In this case, the E and PV neurons rise their activity further compared to the St condition (Fig. 5Ai ,ii; right bars) because of disinhibition via SOM neuron suppression (Fig. 5Aiii ; right bar). The above analysis ignored E → SOM coupling; we now compare it to the case when E → SOM projections are intact. There is little difference in the NSt condition since E neuron activity is low and hence the influence of E neurons upon SOM neurons is small (Fig. 5Bi ,ii,iii; left bars). The same is true for the M+St condition since the modulation continues to suppress SOM neuron activity despite the E projections to SOM (Fig. 5Bi ,ii,iii; right bars). However, in the St condition the E → SOM coupling increases SOM activity (Fig. 5Biii ; right bars), which in turn lowers the E response (and by extension the PV response) compared to the case when E → SOM coupling is absent (Fig. 5Bi ,ii; right bars). The above analysis provides an important observation: when we compare the St and M+St cases, the relative increase in E neuron rates with SOM modulation is greater when E → SOM connections are present (Fig. 5 Ai vs Fig. 5Bi ). Ai Aii Aiii Bi Bii Biii Ci Cii E S Figure 5 : Feedback from E to SOM cells enhances gain modulation. A, Network without feedback from E to SOM neurons (J SE = 0). Firing rates of E (i), PV (ii), and SOM (iii) neurons without stimulus (NSt), with stimulus (St) and with stimulus and (negative) modulation (M+St). B, Same as panel A but with feedback from E to SOM neurons. C, Ratio between the network gain modulation for networks with and without recurrent feedback from E to SOM neurons, α rec /α ff . The ratio increases with the initial firing rate of the SOM neurons (i) and the relative coupling strength between E to SOM neurons and E to PV neurons (ii). The curves correspond to three different initial conditions of the rates (r E , r P ) (black: (2 Hz, 3 Hz), gray: (2 Hz, 2 Hz), light gray: (2 Hz, 1.5 Hz)). To show that this result is robust we employ our linearized rate description to give a general theory for how E -SOM recurrence increases E neuron gain control via SOM neuron modulation. To this end we consider the ratio of network gains in the modulated (m) and unmodulated (u) circuits: α = g m /g u (recall that g = dr E /dI stim ). We do this for feedforward (ff) and recurrent (rec) networks which either lack or preserve E → SOM coupling, respectively. To simplify our analysis we assume that the modulation (I mod < 0) completely silences SOM activity. With this simplification the gain modulation in the recurrent network, α rec , is related to the gain modulation in the feedforward network, α ff , as follows (see Eq. ( 45 )): α rec = α ff 1 -β S J SE dr E dr S . (2) In circuits where SOM neurons effectively inhibit E neurons (i.e p II > p I , see Fig. 1 ) we always have that dr E /dr S < 0. Consequently, Eq. ( 2 ) shows that the gain modulation in the recurrent system is then always larger than the modulation in the feedforward system. Indeed, α rec /α ff > 1 over a large range of both unmodulated SOM neuron activity (Fig. 5Ci ) and the strength of the E → SOM connection (Fig. 5Cii ). In sum, the theory which produced Eq. ( 2 ) generalizes the results of our specific network example (Fig. 5A and B ). Modulation of SOM neurons has additive and multiplicative effects on tuning curves In the previous sections, we measured network gain as the increase of E neuron activity in response to a small increase in stimulus intensity. We now extend our gain modulation analysis to E -PV -SOM circuits with distributed responses, whereby individual neurons are tuned to a particular value of a stimulus (i.e the preferred orientation of a bar in a visual scene or the frequency of an acoustic tone). In what follows the stimulus θ is parametrized with an angle ranging from 0 • to 180 • . We begin by giving all E and PV neurons feedforward input µ ff (θ) which is tuned to θ = 90 • with a Gaussian profile (see Eq. ( 47 ) and Fig. 6Ai ). This homogeneous input to all E and PV neurons ensures that neurons have similar tuning curves, and thus it suffices to consider the population average tuning curve, r(θ) = [r E (θ), r P (θ), r S (θ)]. The slope of the input tuning dµ ff /dθ (Eq. ( 47 )) is translated to response gain dr/dθ via (Eq. ( 49 ) and see Methods 1.8): dr κ dθ = γ∈{E,P} P κγ β γ :=gκ dµ ff dθ , where P = (1 -W) -1 , κ ∈ {E, P, S}. ( 3 ) Here W is the effective connectivity matrix for the E -PV -SOM circuit (W κγ = β κ J κγ ). We have written Eq. ( 3 ) in a compact form where the mapping from input gain to response gain for population κ is given by dr κ /dθ = g κ dµ ff /dθ, where g κ is the gain coefficient. The coefficient g κ has a complicated dependence on the cellular gain β; explicitly through the products P κγ β γ as well as through the matrix P's dependence on the effective connectivity W. If the neuronal transfer is truly linear, so that β is independent of the operating point, then g cannot be changed by an applied modulation. Consequently, any circuit modulation evokes only an additive (or subtractive) shift of response tuning. By similar logic, a nonlinear neuronal transfer would cause the cellular gain β to change under any modulation that shifts the network operating point. In this case, g E will now also depend on the modulation (unless the circuit W and cellular transfer function are very finely tuned), and thus the modulation cannot result in a purely additive tuning curve shift and rather will show some multiplicative (or divisive) component. To explore how SOM neuron modulation mediates multiplicative gain control of tuning curves we first set the unstimulated state of the model to have a low firing rate ( ∼ 0.1 Hz) for both E and PV neurons. Applying stimuli with varying θ shows that all populations are tuned (Fig. 6Bi ,ii,iii). This is expected since both E and PV neurons receive tuned feedforward input and SOM neurons receive input from E neurons which all have the same preferred angle. When the network is modulated through a suppression of SOM neuron activity (I mod < 0) SOM tuning is both subtractively and divisively modulated (Fig. 6Biii ), while the tuning of E and PV neurons undergo both additive and multiplicative changes (Fig. 6Bi ,ii). The additive or subtractive shift reflects the overall rate increase of E and PV neurons and decrease of SOM neurons, respectively. Similarly, the multiplicative or divisive shift arises from an increase in the transfer coefficient g for E and PV neurons and a decrease in g S SOM neuron suppression. Indeed, ∆g κ = g m κg u κ is positive for all θ for the E and P populations (Fig. 6Ci ,ii) and negative for all θ for the S population (Fig. 6Ciii ), showing the respective multiplicative and divisive nature of the modulation on the circuit tuning. It is currently under debate whether tuning in mouse V1 is imposed by tuned input or a combination of weakly tuned input and recurrent connections. Theoretical studies showed that balanced networks extract the weakly tuned component by subtracting the large untuned input component that is supplied to every neuron through recurrent inhibition (Hansel and van Vreeswijk, 2012; Sadeh and Rotter, 2015) and therefore produce sparse and selective responses (Pehlevan and Sompolinsky, 2014) . We test whether SOM mediated gain amplification extends to a network where E and PV neurons have heterogeneous tuning curves. We supply E and PV neurons differently tuned input so that their θ preference is now distributed (Fig. 6D-F show the tuning curves of three representative E and PV neurons). Suppression of SOM activity yields both additive and multiplicative shifts of the tuning curves of E and PV neurons (Fig. 6D-F , solid vs faded curves). Further, since SOM neurons receive convergent input from E neurons with different preferred frequencies, then they are not tuned themselves (Fig. 6F ). Thus, SOM neurons can regulate the network gain of E neurons to stimuli of different directions without having direct access to the stimulus information through tuned E input. The gain of individual E neurons is amplified once inhibition by SOM neurons that target all E neurons and suppress responses of highly active neurons is reduced. E -PV -SOM circuitry promotes a division of labor between PV and SOM neurons. One central conclusion from our study is that modulations of SOM neurons in the E -PV -SOM cortical circuit can segregate the mechanics of gain control and network stability. We established this by comparing and contrasting the modulatory influence of the direct SOM → E pathway (p II ) to that of the indirect SOM → PV → E pathway (p I ). However, perhaps the most salient circuit distinction between SOM and PV interneurons is the strong PV → PV connectivity in comparison to the complete lack of SOM → SOM coupling, at least as reported in the mouse sensory neocortex (Pfeffer et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2016; Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016) . In this concluding section, we investigate how gain control and stability are affected by self-inhibition (or lack thereof) within the E -PV -SOM cortical circuit. We consider the full circuit with connectivity parameters where a depolarizing SOM modulation (I mod > 0) leads to a reduction in E neuron firing rate r E (i.e p II > p I ; Fig 7A, light green curve). As a first exercise, we modify the circuit to include SOM → SOM neuron coupling (p SS > 0). A clear consequence is that modulatory recruitment of SOM activity is less effective at suppressing E neuron activity with stronger SOM self-inhibition (Fig 7A, medium and dark green curves). The intuition for this is straightforward. Recurrent inhibition is a well known form of divisive gain control (Sadeh et al., 2014; Stern et al., 2018; Sutherland et al., 2009) . In our circuit, SOM neurons act as an intermediate stage in a modulatory path to E neurons. Thus, SOM → SOM coupling will ultimately reduce the efficacy (or gain) of I mod to enact a change in E neuron activity. In other words, SOM self-inhibition would act to counter the modulatory influence of the I mod → SOM → E pathway. This provides a functional benefit for the observed lack of SOM → SOM coupling in cortical networks. While SOM neurons lack self-inhibition (as a group), PV neurons connect strongly to other PV neurons (Pfeffer et al., 2013) . In our circuit PV neurons stabilize network dynamics, counteracting the large E → E recurrence which if left unchecked would cause an explosion of network activity. In order to best quench runaway excitation, PV neurons must dynamically track E neuron activity so as to provide inhibition which effectively cancels recurrent excitation (Ozeki et al., 2009; Tsodyks et al., 1997; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996) . This is best accomplished when PV neurons receive the same synaptic inputs as E neurons. Thus, the strong PV → E pathway necessitates a comparable PV → PV pathway. Indeed, over a large range of modulatory states network stability is increased with stronger PV → PV activity (Fig 7B) . Along similar lines, the strong SOM → E pathway needed for effective network modulation should be matched by a strong SOM → PV pathway so that PV neurons are subject to the same SOM inhibition that E neurons receive. This allows PV neurons to better stabilize overall network activity (Fig 7C) . In total, a division of labor within the PV -SOM sub-circuit, whereby SOM neurons mediate modulations of network response and PV neurons are responsible for network stability, is supported by the known synaptic interactions between the PV and SOM neurons. Discussion Cortical inhibition is quite diverse, with molecularly distinguished cell classes having distinct placement within the cortical circuit (Jiang et al., 2015; Markram et al., 2004; Pfeffer et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2016) . Cell specific optogenetic perturbations are a critical probe used to relate circuit wiring to cortical function. In many cases, a preliminary analysis of these new optogenetic datasets involves building circuit intuition only from the dominant direct synaptic pathways while neglecting indirect or disynaptic pathways. This is understandable given the newly realized complexity of the circuit; however, this is precisely the situation where a more formal modeling approach can be very fruitful. Toward this end, recent modelling efforts both at the large (Billeh et al., 2020) and smaller (del Molino et al., 2017; Kuchibhotla et al., 2017; Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016; Mahrach et al., 2020; Veit et al., 2017) scales have incorporated key aspects of interneuron diversity. These studies typically explore which aspects of cellular or circuit diversity are required to replicate a specific experimental finding. In our study, we provide a general theoretical framework that dissects the full E -PV -SOM into interacting sub-circuits. We then identify how specific inhibitory sub-circuits support both network stability and E neuron gain control; two ubiquitous functions often associated with inhibition (Ferguson and Cardin, 2020; Haider et al., 2013; Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011; Ozeki et al., 2009; Veit et al., 2017) . In this way, our approach gives an expanded view of the mechanics of cortical function when compared to more classical results that focus only on how circuit structure supports a single feature of cortical dynamics. The theoretical framework we develop can be adopted to investigate other structure -function relationships in complicated multi-class cortical circuits. Division of labor between PV and SOM interneurons Compelling theories for both network stability (Griffith, 1963; Ozeki et al., 2009; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996) and gain control (Stern et al., 2018; Sutherland et al., 2009) have been developed using simple cortical models having only one inhibitory neuron class. Thus, stability and gain control do not necessarily require cortical circuits with diverse inhibition. What our study points out is that for a cortical circuit to perform gain modulation robustly through disinhibition yet remaining in a regime where the activity is stable, segregating the circuits responsible for gain control and stability has significant advantages. If we accept this division of inhibitory labor hypothesis, then a natural question arises: Why would PV neurons be assigned to stabilization while SOM neurons assigned to E neuron modulation? In fact, there is evidence for the reverse labor assignment, namely that optogenetic perturbation of PV neurons can shift E neuron response gain (Atallah et al., 2012; Seybold et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2012) , and SOM neurons can suppress E neuron firing which in principle would also quench runaway E neuron activity (Adesnik, 2017; Adesnik et al., 2012) . However, the interpretation of optogenetic perturbations can be fraught with subtle but important difficulties (Ferguson and Cardin, 2020; Phillips and Hasenstaub, 2016) ; in this case, the activation of PV neurons without concomitant E neuron activation is somewhat artificial. Further, while it is true that SOM neurons can mediate suppression, this is distinct from conferring stability since stable networks can allow E neurons to have high (but not runaway) activity. Our approach was not to infer a specific division of labor assignment from a synthesis of varied experimental results, yet base our conclusions from the known circuit structure of the E -PV -SOM circuit. Two key circuit features support our division of labor breakdown. Firstly, E neurons and PV neurons experience very similar synaptic environments. Both receive excitatory drive from upstream areas (Tremblay et al., 2016) , and both receive strong recurrent excitation, as well as PV-and SOMmediated inhibition (Pfeffer et al., 2013) . This symmetry in the synaptic input to E and PV neurons allow PV neurons to dynamically track E neuron activity. Consequently, any spurious increase in excitatory drive to E neurons, that could cause a cascade of E population activity due to recurrent E → E connections, is quickly countered by an associated increase in PV inhibition. Secondly, SOM neurons famously do not connect to other SOM neurons (Jiang et al., 2015; Pfeffer et al., 2013; Urban-Ciecko et al., 2015) . Since SOM neurons do provide strong inhibition to E neurons this lack of input symmetry makes them less fit to stabilize E neuron activity than PV neurons. However, it is precisely the lack of SOM neuron self inhibition which allows a high gain for any top-down modulatory signal to induce a change in E neuron response. A large component of the analysis in our manuscript is devoted to establishing this circuit based view of a division of inhibitory labor in E -PV -SOM cortical circuits. There are circuit and cellular distinctions between PV and SOM neurons that were not considered in our study, but could nonetheless still contribute to a division of labor between network stability and modulation. Pyramidal neurons have widespread dendritic arborizations, while by comparison PV neurons have restricted dendritic trees (Markram et al., 2004) . Thus, the dendritic filtering of synaptic inputs that target distal E neurons dendrites would be quite distinct from that of the same inputs onto PV neurons. Fortunately, PV neurons target both the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of both PV and E neurons (Di Cristo et al., 2004; Markram et al., 2004; Tremblay et al., 2016) , so that the symmetry of PV inhibition onto PV and E neurons as viewed by action potential initiation is maintained. In stark contrast, SOM neurons inhibit the distal dendrites of E neurons (Markram et al., 2004) . Dendritic inhibition has been shown to gate burst responses in pyramdial neurons greatly reducing cellular gain (Larkum et al., 2004; Mehaffey et al., 2005) , and recent theoretical work shows how such gating allows for a richer, multiplexed spike train code (Naud and Sprekeler, 2018) . Further, dendritic inhibition is localized near the synaptic site for E → E coupling, and recent modelling (Yang et al., 2016) and experimental (Adler et al., 2019) work shows how such dendritic inhibition can control E synapse plasticity. This implies that SOM neurons may be an important modulator not only of cortical response but also of learning. The E -PV -SOM cortical circuit is best characterized in superficial layers of sensory neocortex (Pfeffer et al., 2013; Tremblay et al., 2016; Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016) , and the wiring of our model network relied heavily on that literature. However, cell densities and connectivity patterns of interneuron populations change across the brain (Kim et al., 2017) and across cortical layers (Jiang et al., 2015; Tremblay et al., 2016) . Our circuit based division of labor thus predicts that any differences in inhibitory connectivity compared to the one we studied will be reflected in changes of the roles that interneurons play in distinct cortical functions. Feedback from E to SOM neurons expands range of gain modulation Our initial analysis of the E -PV -SOM circuit neglects E → SOM cell coupling (Figs 2 and 4 ). While this permits a simplified analysis, a consequence is that SOM activity serves only as a feedforward input to the recurrent E -PV circuit. This restriction constrains the range over which the gain of E neurons can be varied through disinhibition of E and PV neurons. Including the E → SOM connection recruits strong SOM-mediated inhibitory feedback which suppresses the E neuron response to stimuli. Subsequent suppression of SOM neuron activity (through VIP inhibition, for instance) releases E neurons from SOM inhibition so that stimuli now drove high activity (Fig. 5 ). In effect, removing SOM inhibition when it controls E neuron responses through a recurrent E -SOM circuit has a far greater effect than simply removing feedforward SOM → E inhibition. This result is in line with previous findings that recurrent inhibition is more effective at gain modulation than feedforward inhibition (Sadeh et al., 2014; Stern et al., 2018; Sutherland et al., 2009) . To study SOM-mediated gain control, we simply include or remove the E → SOM coupling in the E -PV -SOM circuit. In truth, the E → SOM synaptic coupling is malleable and dependent upon E neuron activity. Short term synaptic dynamics in cortical circuits often show net depression (Zucker and Regehr, 2002) , however, the E → SOM connection famously facilitates with increasing pre-synaptic activity (Beierlein et al., 2003; Reyes et al., 1998; Thomson, 1997; Tremblay et al., 2016; Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016; Yavorska and Wehr, 2016) . Indeed, prolonged activation of E neurons recruits SOM activity through this facilitation (Beierlein et al., 2003) . Thus, this enhanced gain control would require a strong and long lasting drive to E neurons to facilitate the E → SOM synapses. Further work incorporating short term plasticity models (Tsodyks et al., 1998) into the E -PV -SOM model circuit will be required to fully explore how evoked E activity shapes the modulation of E neurons via SOM disinhibition. Impact of SOM neuron modulation on tuning curves Neuronal gain control has a long history of investigation (Ferguson and Cardin, 2020; Salinas and Thier, 2000; Williford and Maunsell, 2006) , with mechanisms that are both bottom-up (Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001) and top-down (Reynolds and Heeger, 2009; Ruff et al., 2018) mediated. A vast majority of early studies focused on single neuron mechanisms; examples include the role of spike frequency adaptation (Ermentrout, 1998) , interactions between fluctuating synaptic conductances and spike generation mechanics (Chance et al., 2002) , and dendritic-dependent burst responses (Larkum et al., 2004; Mehaffey et al., 2005) . These studies often dichotomized gain modulations into a simple arithmetic where they are classified as either additive (subtractive) or multiplicative (divisive) (Silver, 2010; Williford and Maunsell, 2006) . More recently, this arithmetic has been used to dissect the modulations imposed by SOM and PV neuron activity onto E neuron tuning (Atallah et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2012) . Initially, the studies framed a debate about how subtractive and divisive gain control should be assigned to PV and SOM neuron activation. However, a pair of studies in the auditory cortex gave a sobering account whereby activation and inactivation of PV and SOM neurons had both additive and multiplicative effects on tuning curves (Phillips and Hasenstaub, 2016; Seybold et al., 2015) , challenging the tidy assignment of modulation arithmetic into interneuron class. Past modelling efforts have specifically considered how tuned or untuned SOM and PV projections combine with nonlinear E neuron spike responses to produce subtractive or divisive gain changes (Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016; Seybold et al., 2015) . However, the insights in these studies were primarily restricted to feedforward SOM and PV projections to E neurons, and ignored E neuron recurrence within the circuit. In our study we explicitly consider the role of recurrent wiring through how the effective connectivity matrix W will change with network state. We derived that changes in W scale E neuron gain in a multiplicative (or divisive) fashion (see Eq. ( 3 ) and (Sadeh et al., 2014) ). By contrast, additive (or subtractive) gain changes can occur through feedforward inhibition and a roughly linear E neuron transfer (β E does not change). The combination of these observations prompts a testable prediction. The large heterogeneity of subtractive and divisive gain control reported in various studies (Atallah et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014; Natan et al., 2017; Seybold et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2012) may not reflect differences in SOM vs PV projections to a specific E neuron, yet rather how embedded that recorded E neuron and the activated interneurons are in the full recurrent cortical circuit. Methods 1.1 Population model E, PV and SOM neurons are modeled as leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons connected with exponentially decaying synapses τ m dV i dt = -(V i -E L ) + RI i (4) τ s dI i dt = -I i + τ s j w ij n δ(t -t n j ). ( 5 ) Here V i describes the membrane potential of the i-th neuron and I i its synaptic current. R denotes the resistance of the membrane, E L the resting potential, τ m the membrane time constant, τ s the synaptic time constant, w ij weight of the synapse from neurons j to neuron i and t n j the time of the n-th spike of neuron j. When the membrane potential of a neurons exceeds its threshold (V th ), it is reset to its resting potential (V r ), where it is clipped for the refractory period (τ ref ). All weights are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean w and standard deviation 0.1w. All parameters are given in Table 1 . The dynamics are simulated with NEST (Kunkel et al., 2017) . Neurons are subdivided into N E excitatory (E), N P Parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons, and N S Somatostatin-positive (SOM) neurons. We assume that 20% of all neurons are inhibitory (η = 1/4) and that the ratio of PV and SST densities is given by ρ = N S /N P = 0.83 (Pfeffer et al., 2013) , the population sizes are given by N E = N, N P = η 1 + ρ N = η P N, N S = ρη P N. (6) Pairs of neurons are connected randomly with p κγ being the probability of a connection from a neuron in population γ to a neuron in population κ (κ, γ ∈ {E, , S}). Thus the connectivity between populations is described by J = wN     p EE -     =     J EE -J EP -J ES J PE -J PP -J PS J SE -J SP -J SS     , (7) where the inhibitory connection strength is amplified by g = 4 and the effective weight is given by w = τ s Rw. Each neuron in population κ receives additional input from external Poisson sources with connection strength wN p ext κ and firing rate r ext = 8 Hz. In matrix representation the external connection strength is given by J ext = wN diag(p ext E , p ext P , p ext S ). In some cases, populations receive input from inhibitory external Poisson sources with connection strength -g wN p ext,inh κ which could represent, for example, VIP neurons. External input due to stimulus or modulation is given the same connection strength. Modulatory input is given by J mod = -g wN diag(0, 0, p ext,inh S ), (8) such that I mod = p ext,inh S r ext . Theoretical description of the population dynamics The population rate dynamics of E, PV and SOM neurons (r = (r E , r P , r S )) are described by a firing rate model (Wilson and Cowan, 1972) τ dr dt = -r + f (r, q), with f (r, q) = Φ(µ(r, q), σ(r, q)), where q denotes the firing rate of external input due to a stimulus or modulation. The static transfer function Φ is given by the inverse of the mean first-passage time of the membrane potential of the neurons. It follows from diffusion approximation of the membrane potentials of the neurons within one population, assuming that all neurons are uncorrelated (Fourcaud and Brunel, 2002 ) Φ(µ, σ) = τ m √ π ( Ṽth -µ)/σ ( Ṽr-µ)/σ e s 2 (1 + erf(s))ds -1 , (10) with Ṽr = V r + σ α 2 τ s τ m , Ṽth = V th + σ α 2 τ s τ m , α = 1 √ 2 ζ 1 2 , ( 11 ) with the Riemann zeta function ζ. The mean and variance of the input current to the neurons are given by µ(r, q) = Jr + J ext q and σ 2 (r, q) = w √ N J σ r + w √ N J ext q, (12) with J σ iE = J iE , J σ iP = gJ iP and J σ iS = gJ iS . In the steady-state the population averaged rates are given by the self-consistent equation r(q) = f (r, q). ( 13 ) Noisy rate dynamics induced by the finite-size of the network can be described be the following dynamical variable (Grytskyy, 2013) : y = r + x, τ dr dt = -r + f (y, q), (14) where x is a vector of white noise terms x κ with variance r κ /N κ . Network gain Changes of the steady-state rates induced by small changes in the external rate can be described by linearization around the fixed point (del Molino et al., 2017; Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016 ) dr dq = dΦ dµ dµ(r, q) dq = B J dr dq + J ext , (15) with B = diag(β E , β P , β S ) and β i = dΦ(µ i , σ i )/dµ i (16) yielding dr dq = 1 -W -1 W ext , with W = BJ and W ext = BJ ext . ( 17 ) Here 1 denotes the identity matrix. Note that we omitted changes in the fixed point due to the rate dependence of the variance of the input since it is small compared to changes in the mean input. Thus the change of population rates δr induced by a change in the external rate δq is given by δr = dr dq δq. (18) and the matrix dr dq has been termed a response matrix (del Molino et al., 2017) . If all eigenvalues of W are smaller than 1 the response matrix can be written as: dr dq = ∞ i=0 W i W ext . ( 19 ) and the response of the excitatory neurons to modulation of the SOM neurons gives dr E dq S = β S J ext S ∞ i=0 W i 13 (20) = β S J ext S β E J ES -β 2 E J EE J ES + β E β P J EP J PS (21) +(β P J EP J PE + β S J ES J SE -β E J 2 EE )β 2 E J ES (22) +(β E J EE J EP -β P J EP J PP )β E β P J PS + ...) . (23) Here W i 13 denotes the element in the first row and third column of the matrix. Our expression shows that the response matrix describes the summed effect of all possible pathways through the network whereby an externally applied signal could influence population E rates. Assuming that modulation only targets SOM neurons δq = (0, 0, I mod ), the rate change of excitatory neurons induced by modulation is given by δr E = dr E dI mod β S Ĩmod = β E J EP β P J PS -(1 + β P J PP )β E J ES det(1 -W) β S Ĩmod (24) with Ĩmod = J ext S I mod and the rate change of SOM neurons by δr S = det(1 -W EP ) det(1 -W) β S Ĩmod with W EP = W EE W EP W PE W PP . ( 25 ) Thus the rate change of the excitatory neurons can be expressed as a function of the rate change of SOM neurons as δr E = β E J EP β P J PS -(1 + β P J PP )J ES det(1 -W EP ) δr S . (26) Network gain is defined as the rate change of neurons in response to a stimulus, assuming that stimuli target E and PV neurons δq = I stim = (I E stim , I P stim , 0), E neuron network gain is given by g E = dr E dI stim = β E (1 + β P J PP ) ĨE stim -β P J EP ĨP stim det(1 -W) with ĨE,P stim = J ext E,P I E,P stim . (27) Paradoxical responses and gain maximum The response of the PV neurons to SOM modulation is given by dr P dI mod = -β P β E J ES J PE + (1 -β E J EE )J PS det(1 -W) = -β P J PS + β E (J ES J PE -J EE J PS ) det(1 -W) (28) When SOM neurons only project to PV neurons (J ES = 0), the rate of PV neurons decreases if the E -PV circuit is in the non-ISN regime (β E J EE < 1) and increases otherwise. The latter case has been termed paradoxical response (Tsodyks et al., 1997) . If SOM neurons also project to E neurons, PV neurons get additional negative drive from the lack of E feedback yielding decreased PV rates even in the ISN regime. Hence we only expect paradoxical responses if the product of connection strength J EE J PS is large. Thus the observation of paradoxical responses of PV neurons in response to suppression via SOM neurons cannot disclose whether the E neurons operate in the ISN or non-ISN regime if SOM neurons also suppress the activity of E neurons. Modulation controls the firing rates and cellular gains (βs) of E and PV population, and network gain (g) explicitly depends on the latter. Differentiating Eq. ( 27 ) with respect to β E we have: dg E dβ E = 1 + β P J PP det(1 -W) 2 ĨE stim + β P (J PP ĨE stim -J EP ĨP stim ) . (29) We see that dg E dβ E increases if PV → PV coupling is strong and PV neurons are not driven strongly by the stimulus. Differentiating Eq. ( 27 ) with respect to β P gives: dg E dβ P = β E J EP det(1 -W) 2 -ĨE stim + β E (J EE ĨP stim -J PE ĨE stim ) + J SE A, (30) with A = β 2 E J EP β S det(1 -W) 2 J PS ĨE stim -J ES ĨP stim . (31) Here we see that when β P increases then g E decreases if E → E coupling is not too strong, PV neurons are not driven strongly by the stimulus, and SOM neurons project in a feedforward manner to both E and PV neurons. When increasing g E via the disinhibitory pathway SOM → PV → E neurons in the ISN regime, the rate of E and PV neurons increases. Assuming that the circuit operates below the saturating regime of the transfer function, the cellular gains β E and β P therefore also increase. The increased E rate then increases g E , but the increased PV rate decreases g E , which explains the maximum at g E . (Fig. 2Biii ). Quantifying network stability Let us consider the linearized deterministic rate dynamics stemming from Eq. ( 9 ): τ dr dt = -r + W(r + q). (32) Stability can be inferred from the eigenvalues of the Jacobian W -1 (where 1 is the identity matrix). The steady-state rate dynamics become unstable if one of the eigenvalues of W has a real part that is larger than one. Going beyond this binary view of stability (stable vs unstable) we use a measure of distance to instability which can inform us whether the system becomes more or less stable with state changes. A frequency-dependent proximity to instability can be inferred from the Nyquist plot of the transfer function of the rate dynamics (Doyle et al., 2009) . For simplicity, consider the dynamics of the least stable mode associated to the eigenvalue λ of W: τ ṙ = -r + λ(r + q), (33) where r and q denote the rate r and input q projected onto the least stable mode, respectively. We remark that we consider q to be time-dependent with Laplace transform Q(ω). Solving the equation above in the Laplace domain gives the following relation between input and output R(ω) = λ(ω) 1 -λ(ω) Q(ω) with λ(ω) = λ 1 + iωτ . ( 34 ) The term 1/(1λ(ω)) is referred to as sensitivity function in control theory (Doyle et al., 2009) and its inverse measures the distance of the Nyquist curve to the critical point, which is here given by (λ) = 1. The curve generated by λ(ω) provides a distance measure of the rate dynamics to instabilities for ω > 0 (Fig. 8 ). Thus, it is natural to measure the proximity of the rate dynamics to instability via: d min = min ωτ |1 -λ(ω)|. (35) Since λ(ω) converges to zero for large frequencies d min is upper bounded by one. same distance measure quantifies how easily the dynamics are destabilized by internally generated noise, which is amplified by the circuit as Y (ω) = 1 1 -λ(ω) X(ω). (36) Figure 8 : Measure of distance to instability. Sketch of Nyquist plots corresponding to the system at rest (λ 1 (ω)) and the modulated system (λ 2 (ω)). Only the mode closest to instability is shown. Modulation increases the imaginary part of the eigenvalue but leaves the real part unaltered. d min is defined as the minimal distance of λ(ω) to the critical value (λ) = 1. Here, we simplified the dynamic transfer function as a first-order low pass filter. A more rigorous mapping of the frequency-dependent input-output relation between the rate and the spiking model can be achieved by applying linear response theory when deriving the transfer function from the Fokker-Planck equation (Brunel and Hakim, 1999; Lindner and Schimansky-Geier, 2001) . For LIF-neurons in the balanced regime, this results in small modifications of the Nyquist plots from first-order low pass filters (Bos et al., 2016) . Stability of the E -PV sub-circuit Considering the circuit composed of E and PV neurons, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian (W EP -1) are given by λ 1,2 = β E J EE -β P J PP -2 2 ± (β E J EE -β P J PP -2) 2 4 + β E J EP β P J PE . (37) Thus the real part of the largest eigenvalue fulfills (λ max ) ≥ β E J EE -β P J PP -2 2 . ( 38 ) Hence if there is no coupling between the PV neurons J PP = 0, the activity of excitatory neurons be dynamically stabilized and the susceptibility at which the dynamics become unstable is given by β critical E = 2/J EE . ( 39 ) Gain amplification The E neuron network gain in the unmodulated system with feedforward inhibition by SOM neurons is given by: g ff u ≡ dr E dI stim = β E (1 + β P J PP )I E -β E β P J EP I P det(1 -W) := f (β E , β P ) h(β E , β P ) . ( 40 ) Modulating the circuit by removing inhibition from SOM neurons shifts E and PV neurons to a new fixed point with cellular gains β * E and β * P , respectively. Similarly, the network gain in the modulated state is: g ff m = f (β * E , β * P ) h(β * E , β * P ) . ( 41 ) Modulation then amplifies gain by the factor α ff = g ff m /g ff u . Starting from the same fixed point as in the feedforward system, the gain in the unmodulated circuit with recurrently connected SOM neurons is then: g rec u = f (β E , β P ) h(β E , β P ) -u(β E , β P , β S ) , (42) with u(β E , β P , β S ) = (β E β P J EP J PSβ E (1 + β P J PP )J ES )β S J SE = h(β E , β P )β S J SE dr E dr S (43) and dr E /dr S for the corresponding feedforward circuit. Assuming that modulation silences SOM neurons, the circuit is shifted to the same fixed point as in the feedforward case and therefore g rec m = f (β * E , β * P ) h(β * E , β * P ) = g ff m . ( 44 ) The gain amplification in the circuit with recurrently connected SOM neurons is hence given by α rec = g rec m g rec u = α ff 1 -β S J SE dr E dr S . ( 45 ) Since dr E /dr S is always negative for the circuit that supports gain modulation by removing SOM activity, the gain amplification in the recurrent system is always larger than in the feedforward system. Gain modulation in populations We first assume that the E, PV and SOM population each has a stable tuning curve with respect to some stimuli θ ∈ (0 • , 180 • ); we denote the population tuning curve as r(θ) = (r E (θ), r P (θ), r S (θ)). In equilibrium (i.e neglecting transients) the change of the tuning curves with respect to the angle is given by dr dθ = d dθ f (µ rec (θ), µ ff (θ)), (46) with the static transfer function f (Eq. ( 9 ) and Eq. ( 10 )) and the mean input from recurrent and feedforward connections µ rec and µ ff (Eq. ( 12 )). We assume that the feedforward input is tuned with a Gaussian profile and that it only targets E and PV neurons: µ ff (θ) = wN p θ e -(θ-θ p ) 2 /σ 2 θ     1 1 0     , (47) with the preferred angle θ p = 90 • . Analyzing the sensitivity of firing rates to changes in preferred orientation (analogously to changes in the input intensity as analyzed in Methods 1.3) gives the stimulus gain mapping from feedforward input to firing rate output: dr dθ = (1 -W) -1 Ĩ(θ), Ĩκ = β κ dµ ff κ dθ , (48) showing that the slope of the input tuning curve of population κ is effectively multiplied by the factor g κ . We can extend the analysis to networks where individual E and PV neurons receive differently tuned input (i.e distributed tuning). In that case the response sensitivity dr/dθ and the mean inputs µ rec , µ ff are of dimension N (the number of neurons). The input to the i th neuron of population κ is given by: µ ff iκ (θ) = wN p θ e -(θ-θ p iκ ) 2 /σ 2 θ , (50) with the preferred angle θ p iκ = 180i/N κ . Thus the input vector for each θ is sparse and the response of the balanced network is also sparse and selective (Pehlevan and Sompolinsky, 2014) . The amplification of sparse input vectors can be understood as the projection of the input onto the eigenvectors of the N × N dimensional Jacobian -W N ×N ) weighted by the inverse of the associated eigenvalues (Sadeh et al., 2014) . Since some eigenvalues of the random connectivity matrix W N ×N are close to one, their modes get amplified. When the activity of SOM neurons is removed the product of the population eigenvalues (det(1 -W)) becomes smaller which subsequently increases gain. Since the eigenvectors of population eigenvalues affect all neurons in one population equally, the tuning curve slopes of individual neurons is increased (Fig. 6D-F ). In particular, if SOM neurons only project feedforward to the E and PV neurons, the population response scaling (det(1 -W) -1 = det(1 -W EP ) -1 ) is determined by the changes of cellular gains of the E and PV neurons alone. In contrast, if SOM neurons are part of the recurrent circuit (J SE = 0), removing their activity directly affects the population response scaling (det(1 -W) -1 = (det(1 -W EP )β E (p Ip II )β S J SE ) -1 ) resulting in stronger multiplicative scaling. Parameter Figure 1 : 1 Figure 1: Tradeoff between two inhibitory motifs in the E -PV -SOM cortical circuit. A, Sketch of the network model with neuron class-specific connections motivated by (Pfeffer et al., 2013) . A modulatory input (black line) is applied to the SOM neurons. This input results in a change in the SOM neuron population firing rate (δr S ; green line), which in turn causes a change of excitatory neuron activity (δr E ; red line). Assuming a linear relation between δr S and δr E allows δr E to be determined by summing over all possible pathways through the network by which SOM activity can influence E activity (see Eq. (23)). B, The relation between δr S and δr E after summing over all paths (see Eq. (26)). Sketches visualizes the tradeoff between the inhibitory and disinhibitory pathways. J κγ summarizes the number and strength of connections from population γ to population κ (κ ,γ ∈ {E, P, S}, see Eq. (7)); β κ denotes the cellular gain of population κ (see Eq.

INTRODUCTION In a world where objects and events occurring around us have varying degrees of relevance and importance, the ability to selectively direct and maintain attention on a sample of relevant events at the expense of events classed as irrelevant is an obvious advantage. However, given the cost and benefits associated with either attending or not attending to any given stimulus, a discriminative balance between selectivity and breadth is needed. Accordingly, a number of clinical conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (Clayton, Richards, & Edwards, 1999) , autism (Sturm, Fernell, & Gillberg, 2004) , attention deficit disorder (Barkley, 1997) , and schizophrenia (Addington & Addington, 1998; Nuechterlein & Dawson, 1984) have all been associated with attentional abnormalities. In respect to the maintenance and division of attention, early theorists proposed that there could only be a single focus, functionally analogous to a spot light (e.g., Posner, Snyder, & Davidson, 1980; Eriksen & Hoffman, 1972) or zoom lens (Eriksen & St James, 1986) . How-ever, more recent work has shown that it is possible to simultaneously track multiple objects distributed throughout space (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988) , independent of eye movements (Culham et al., 1998 ). An increasing number of studies are attempting to investigate the neural underpinnings of multiple-object tracking. This work includes an fMRI study implicating a role for regions of the frontal cortex (Culham, Cavanagh, & Kanwisher, 2001) , whereas psychophysical studies have been concerned primarily with the relative involvement of feature-based (Scholl, Pylyshyn, & Feldman, 2001; Yantis, 1992) and space-based cues (Somers, Dale, Seiffert, & Tootell, 1999; Luck, Chelazzi, Hillyard, & Desimone, 1997) . Despite this recent work, a basic understanding of the attentional processes remains elusive. Here we use a pharmacological approach in an attempt to gain some insights into the mechanisms involved. Psilocybin, the main hallucinogenic compound found in Psilocybe mushrooms, is the primary focus of this study as it is known to transiently alter an individual's cognitive and perceptual state (Carter, Pettigrew, Hasler, et al., 2005; Carter, Pettigrew, Burr, et al., 2004; Hasler, Grimberg, Benz, Huber, & Vollenweider, 2004; Umbricht et al., 2003) . The characteristic capability of this drug to induce altered states of consciousness is believed to result from its ability to functionally mimic the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) at selective receptor sites. Receptor binding studies in rats have shown that psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), the pharmacologically active metabolite of psilocybin (Hasler, Bourquin, Brenneisen, Bar, & Vollenweider, 1997) , primarily binds to 5-HT 2A receptors (K i = 6 nM) and with a lower affinity also to the 5-HT 1A sites (K i = 190 nM) (McKenna, Repke, Lo, & Peroutka, 1990) . The 5-HT 2A receptors are located predominantly on the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells of the cortex ( Jakab & Goldman-Rakic, 1998) , with activation of these receptors leading to increased cortical activity believed to be driven by glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials, particularly in Layer V (Aghajanian & Marek, 1997) . This effect is most pronounced in the frontal cortex (Vollenweider et al., 1997) , where there is an increased density of 5-HT 2A receptors as compared to more posterior regions (Wong et al., 1987) . In contrast, the 5-HT 1A receptors are localized presynaptically as somatodendritic autoreceptors in the raphe nucleus of the brainstem (Sotelo, Cholley, El Mestikawy, Gozlan, & Hamon, 1990) . Activation of these receptors inhibits the firing of raphe neurons and associated release of 5-HT into the cortex (Sprouse & Aghajanian, 1986; Aghajanian & Hailgler, 1975) . Concentrations of postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors have also been identified in the hippocampus (Hamon et al., 1990) and in the pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex (Glaser, Rath, Traber, Zilles, & Schleicher, 1985; Pazos & Palacios, 1985) , where they have been found to inhibit pyramidal cell activity in a manner proportional to 5-HT release from the raphe (Puig, Artigas, & Celada, 2005) . Therefore, psilocybin increases activation of the prefrontal cortex on two counts: directly via activation of the 5-HT 2A receptor and indirectly via the reduced inhibition of pyramidal cell activity in the prefrontal cortex as a consequence of the reduction in 5-HT release from the raphe. To our knowledge, the current study is the first attempt to look at the pharmacology underlying attentional tracking, or any task analogous to it. However, many human and animal studies suggest that serotonin (5-HT) and the 5-HT 1A receptor may be relevant to attention. For example, human studies have shown that 5-HT depletion leads to impairment of go/no-go tasks requiring attentional set shifting and related inhibition of attentional set (Rubinsztein et al., 2001) . In rats, studies of attention have focused primarily on measures of impulsivity, such as the five-choice serial reaction time task (Carli, Robbins, Evenden, & Everitt, 1983) . Using this paradigm, direct administration of the 5-HT 1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT into the prefrontal cortex was found to improve attentional performance (Winstanley et al., 2003) . However, both indirect administration of the same compound (Carli & Samanin, 2000) and global 5-HT depletion (Harrison, Everitt, & Robbins, 1997) resulted in impaired performance on the same task. This suggests that if activation of the 5-HT 1A receptors is not limited to the prefrontal cortex, the overall reduction in the release of 5-HT from the raphe that results from activation of the presynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors in this region will lead to an impairment of attention. There is considerable anecdotal evidence that attentional processes are affected by psilocybin (i.e., Shulgin & Shulgin, 1997; McKenna, 1992) and formal self-rating scales indicate that psilocybin can cause a subjective reduction in vigilance (Hasler et al., 2004) . However, only one study has attempted to assess the effect of psilocybin on attention objectively. Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. (2002) examined both reaction time and covert orienting of attention. Although the authors highlight the preliminary nature of their findings, the observed effects of psilocybin were interpreted as indicating a difficulty in disengaging attention from previously attended locations. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on attentional function using a task that does not require a speeded reaction time response, which may be affected by motor control or other nonattentional factors. Partially motivated by subjective reports in which subjects believe they have an increased capacity to monitor many elements, we chose a multiple-object tracking task similar to that used by Pylyshyn and Storm (1988) (Figure 1A ). The task required subjects to track a subset (up to 8) of 20 visually indistinguishable randomly moving green dots and is believed to test an individual's capacity to maintain multiple focuses of attention simultaneously (cf. Alvarez, Horowitz, Arsenio, DiMase, & Wolfe, in press) . As it has been suggested that the maintenance or direction of attention over time involves working memory (Oksama & Hyona, 2004; Desimone, 1998) and both processes are believed to be subserved by similar regions of the prefrontal cortex (Culham et al., 2001; Courtney, Petit, Maisog, Ungerleider, & Haxby, 1998) , we were also interested in whether changes in the performance of spatial working memory might also arise. To test spatial working memory, an electronic version of Corsi's block tapping task was used (Milner, 1971 ) (Figure 1B ). In this task, subjects were required to remember and reproduce a sequence of (up to 9) spatial locations. This measure of working memory was chosen because performance on the task had previously been shown to be sensitive to administration of psilocybin (Wittmann et al., submitted) . Psilocybin is known to activate both 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptor subtypes. However, the majority of the drug's subjective effects are generally attributed to activation of the 5-HT 2A receptor (Nichols, 2004; Vollenweider, Vollenweider-Scherpenhuyzen, Babler, Vogel, & Hell, 1998) . Therefore, an additional goal of the current experiment was to investigate whether blockade of this receptor with the selective 5-HT 2A receptor in working memory function (Williams, Rao, & Goldman-Rakic, 2002) . RESULTS Subjective Effects The subjective effects of the four drug conditions, as measured by the 5D-ASC rating scale (Dittrich, Lamparter, & Maurer, 1999; Dittrich, 1998) Comparing the psilocybin-alone condition with the psilocybin after ketanserin pretreatment condition, no significant differences were observed for RV or AA, however, significant differences were seen for the other three factors (OB: p < .001; AED: p < .05; VR: p < .001). Multiple-object Tracking Performance on the tracking task varied inversely with the number of targets to track. It was close to perfect for two or three targets, but then dropped off markedly as the number of targets rose. To obtain a measure of task performance, we fitted the individual  data with a simple model that assumed that subjects were capable of tracking a number of target items perfectly: pðTÞ¼min T P T þ T À T P rT ; 1 where p(T ) is the proportion of correct responses for T number of targets, T p is the number of targets that can be tracked perfectly and r is the number of response choices (equal to 4 in this study). The first term predicts the probability of correctly tracking a target; the second term allows for a correct guess, in the event that the target was not successfully tracked. Individual data were fitted with this function, minimizing squared errors to find the best value of T p . In Figure 3A , the average data for each of the four conditions have been fitted by the model. Using this same measure of performance calculated by the model (i.e., number of dots successfully tracked), a two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA found attentional tracking to be significantly affected by both drug [F(3,21) = 3.38, p < .05] and time [F(1,7) = 18.06, p < .01]. As would be expected, Tukey's post hoc analysis showed no significant difference between any of the four drug conditions at pretest. However, 120 min following drug administration, psilocybin (A = 2.24, s = 0.75) and the psilocybin plus ketanserin pretreatment (A = 2.35, s = 0.60) were both significantly ( p < .05) reduced from placebo (A = 3.15, s = 0.57) and ketanserin alone (A = 3.14, s = 0.69), but did not differ significantly from each other ( p = .99). Likewise, there was no difference between the placebo and ketanserin conditions ( p = .99) (Figure 3B ). To ensure that the effects observed did not simply reflect the use of this particular model, the data were also analyzed in a more direct way. Similar to previous studies using this task, proportion of correct responses was considered for the five target dots, a condition in which response had neither saturated nor bottomed out. ANOVA showed attentional tracking to be significantly affected by drug administration [F(3,21) = 3.64, p < .05], with Tukey's post hoc analysis showing a significant reduction in performance from placebo and ketanserin, 120 min after drug intake, for both the psilocybin ( p < .01) and psilocybin plus ketanserin ( p < .05) conditions. Figure 3C shows results for the five target tracking as a discriminability index d 0 for the four different conditions, calculated from the percent correct scores, taking into account that it was a fouralternative forced-choice task. Spatial Working Memory Using a two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA, no significant effect on the number of boxes remembered correctly in sequence ''span length'' was found for drug [F(3,21) = 0.57, p = 0.64] or time [F(1,7) = 1.56, p = .12] (Figure 4A ). Further confirming the lack of effect of psilocybin on spatial working memory performance, this nonsignificant result was similarly observed after a 2 Â 2 ANOVA comparing only the placebo and psilocybin conditions, before and after drug intake [drug: F(1,7) = The dashed gray lines indicate the percentage of correct responses predicted for subjects successfully tracking exactly 0 to 4 targets, respectively. (B) The calculated mean number of targets successfully tracked at pretest and 120 min under placebo (white), psilocybin (black), psilocybin with ketanserin (black/gray stripes), and ketanserin alone (gray). Psilocybin alone and in combination with ketanserin was significantly reduced from pretest and placebo levels 120 min after drug intake. There was no significant difference between any of the other time or drug conditions. (C) Discriminability index d 0 for trials with five tracking targets for the four different conditions (symbols as for B). Here d 0 was calculated from the percent correct scores, taking into account that it was a four-alternative forced-choice task. For both graphs, error bars represent standard errors of the mean, ''*'' denotes p < .05. 0.61, p = .46; time: F(1,7) = 0.06, p = .82]. The total number of errors in sequence order or location ''total errors'' was also unaffected by drug administration [F(3,21) = 0.64, p = .60] or time of testing [F(1,7) = 2.20, p = .18] (Figure 4B ). Individual Data Figure 5 shows the individual results for the psilocybin and placebo condition as a scatter plot. The reduction in attentional tracking (ratio of pretest to 120-min peak testing) performance is plotted against the reduction in spatial working memory performance. Although there is some scatter in the data, most points show a greater effect for attentional tracking than spatial working memory. After psilocybin intake, there was virtually no correlation (r 2 = .01, p = .84) between the two measures, consistent with the claimed functional dissociation. This is compared to the placebo condition (r 2 =. 2 5 ,p = .21-excluding the single outlier r 2 = .93, p = .004). DISCUSSION Administration of the subjectively hallucinogenic dose (215 Ag/kg) of the 5-HT 1A/2A agonist psilocybin was found to impair multiple-object tracking, but not spatial working memory. Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT 2A antagonist did not reduce this deficit. Psilocybin eliminated the correlation between performance on attentional tracking and spatial working memory tasks reported previously (Oksama & Hyona, 2004) and seen in the placebo condition of the current experiment. This finding suggests that psilocybin causes a selective attentional impairment and a resulting functional dissociation between attention and working memory processes. That this effect was not blocked by pretreatment with ketanserin implies that it may be mediated by activation of the 5-HT 1A rather than the 5-HT 2A receptor subtype. The observation that ketanserin alone had no effect on either the working memory or attentional tracking task is further evidence  plotted against spatial working memory (abscissa). The estimates of performance reduction were calculated as the ratio of pretest to the 120-min peak testing for the psilocybin condition. The respective symbols and regression line for the two conditions are: placebo = white square (dashed gray line) and psilocybin = black square (black line). The data point enclosed in a circle was treated as an outlier and not included in calculating the regression line. The arrows show the respective mean reduction in performance for the psilocybin condition. The vertical and horizontal dashed lines passing through unity correspond to no drug effect. The lack of correlation between the two tasks after psilocybin administration is further support that psilocybin leads to a functional dissociation between attentional tracking and spatial working memory. against a direct role of the 5-HT 2A receptor in these processes. Multiple-object Tracking In order to calculate an overall measure of attentional performance, we fitted the data with a simple model based on the assumption that a correct response indicated either that the subject had successfully tracked the probe target or had correctly guessed its identity from the four response options provided. Comparing the calculated number of objects successfully tracked, psilocybin-both alone and after pretreatment with ketanserin-was found to significantly impair attentional tracking ability. Data from previous human and animal studies suggest an involvement of serotonin (5-HT) and the 5-HT 1A receptor in attention (Winstanley et al., 2003; Rubinsztein et al., 2001; Carli & Samanin, 2000; Harrison et al., 1997) . The results of the current study are consistent with the association between attentional impairments and reduced cortical 5-HT release implied in these studies, as psilocybin is known to inhibit 5-HT release via activation of presynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors in the raphe (Aghajanian & Hailgler, 1975) . This interpretation is further supported by recent fMRI investigations that implicate regions of the frontal cortex in multiple-object tracking (Culham et al., 2001) . Consequently, a psilocybininduced reduction in the release of 5-HT into regions of the prefrontal cortex may disrupt multiple-object tracking ability, mediated by these regions. The physiological mechanisms of attention are not yet well understood. However, it has been suggested that attention acts by modulating the magnitude rather than the selectivity of the response mediated by the respective neurons or cortical regions involved (Saenz, Buracas, & Boynton, 2002; Luck et al., 1997; Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Motter, 1994; Posner et al., 1980) . This modulation is believed to be driven through bottom-up, mutual inhibition between lateral interactions and topdown feedback (Desimone, 1998; Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Luck et al., 1997) . However, in addition to an enhancement of neural responses, more recent work has found that attention to a particular location also results in a widespread suppression of activity levels associated with nontarget objects (distracters) or visual field locations (Hopf, Boelmans, Schoenfeld, Heinze, & Luck, 2002; Chelazzi, Miller, Duncan, & Desimone, 2001; Smith, Singh, & Greenlee, 2000; Chelazzi, Duncan, Miller, & Desimone, 1998; Chelazzi, Miller, Duncan, & Desimone, 1993) , such that ''cells responded as though the irrelevant distracters had been filtered from the visual field'' (Desimone, 1998) . Here we speculate that the effects of psilocybin might reflect a relative reduction in the efficacy of these inhibitory processes. The finding that ketanserin did not attenuate the observed attentional impairment suggests the 5-HT 2A receptor is not strongly involved in psilocybin's effects on attention. However, consideration of subjective reports suggests this conclusion may be overly simplistic. Subjects reported that after taking psilocybin, although they were still able to understand the task requirements, they generally found that the attention task was considerably harder. It was often reported that all of the dots became more dynamic, taking on ''a life of their own.'' One subject compared it to a bird's eye view of a Chinese market place, whereas another reported an impression of children chasing each other. This increase in salience of all of the dots may have made it more difficult both to selectively track the target dots and to ignore the ''distracter'' dots. After pretreatment with ketanserin, subjects verbally reported that they no longer experienced the increased intensity or ''personalities'' within the stimulus, but rather they reported a general feeling of sedation and associated difficulties with maintaining attention. These reports are in line with the results of the 5D-ASC self-rating scale that found psilocybin significantly affected each of the scale's five measures, and pretreatment with ketanserin returned most of these scores to baseline levels. The only 5D-ASC factor that remained significantly elevated was ''reduced vigilance,'' which relates to states of drowsiness, reduced alertness, and impairment of cognitive function. Therefore, although there was no difference in average performance between the psilocybin-alone condition and the psilocybin plus ketanserin condition, it cannot be ruled out that the two states were quite different, with the stimulation of the 5-HT 1A receptor leading to a reduction in vigilance and attentional performance, while the increased cortical stimulation associated with psilocybin induced activation of the 5-HT 2A receptor increasing the salience of the nontargets, making them harder to ignore. In support of this interpretation, performance under the psilocybin and psilocybin plus ketanserin conditions was found to be uncorrelated to the extent that there was even a slight but nonsignificant negative trend (r = À.67). However, much more data would be required before any conclusions could be drawn about independent mechanisms. Spatial Working Memory The current finding that a 215-Ag/kg dose of psilocybin caused a slight but insignificant impairment of performance in spatial working memory is in line with a previous study that found performance on the same task to be completely unaffected by a lower dose of 115 Ag/kg and slightly but significantly impaired with the higher dose of 250 Ag/kg (Wittmann et al., submitted) . This evidence that psilocybin has only minimal effects on spatial working memory was further corroborated by subjective reports that it was still possible to perform at the same level, but only that greater effort was required to remain focused on the task. This was even true at levels of psilocybin that produced profound changes in conscious state. For example, one subject was convinced that the computer was trying to trick her, so she purposely reproduced the sequence incorrectly. On the following trials she decided that the computer ''had learnt its lesson'' and she made no subsequent errors. These results appear to stand in contradiction to experiments in monkeys and humans suggesting 5-HT 2A receptor involvement in spatial working memory (Williams et al., 2002; Vollenweider et al., 1998) . However, neither of these studies reported direct changes in performance. In one study, an increase in response time on a spatial working memory task was interpreted as reflecting impaired spatial working memory function (Vollenweider et al., 1998) . In the other study, 5-HT 2A stimulation enhanced spatial tuning and increased delay activity for preferred locations in a population of prefrontal neurons believed to be involved in working memory (Williams et al., 2002) . Therefore, without clear evidence linking 5-HT 2A activation with changes in direct behavioral performance, the role of this receptor in spatial working memory remains unclear. Attention and Working Memory The functional dissociation that psilocybin produced between attentional tracking and spatial working memory goes against much of the current thinking that assumes considerable functional dependence between these two processes. The extent of this co-dependence has lead to attention being described as a ''gateway to memory'' wherein memory is believed to play a crucial role in determining which stimulus will be attended (Desimone, 1998) . It was even suggested by Desimone (1998 Desimone ( , p. 1252 ) that ''some of the neuronal mechanisms for memory and attention are so intertwined that one may question whether they are even distinguishable.'' Indeed, a considerable body of evidence links attention to working memory. Not only have they been shown to be functionally related (Oksama & Hyona, 2004 ), but the anatomical locations implicated in attentional tracking (Culham et al., 2001) are also believed to be involved in working memory (Courtney et al., 1998; Courtney, Ungerleider, Keil, & Haxby, 1997) . However, the results of the current study suggest that it might be possible to tease the two processes apart. This co-dependence may be limited to only certain elements of the two processes. For example, if attentional tracking and working memory both involve (1) selection of targets, (2) biasing the selected targets relative to distracters, and (3) maintenance of the state over time, it may be the case that psilocybin is selectively disrupting only this second stage. One clear prediction based on this speculation is that performance on attentional tasks without distracting components would be unaffected or even enhanced by psilocybin, whereas spatial working memory tasks involving some distracting elements would be more strongly impaired. Although the above interpretation is in line with the observed results, it should be considered with caution at this stage. One difficulty is that, despite the clear selectivity in impairment observed here, the current study cannot rule out the possibility that the results reflect a difference in sensitivity of the two tasks. Although the responses were not saturated in either task, there is a possibility that difficulty was not well matched to the attentional task, accounting for the difference in observed results. Confirmation of the reported functional dissociation, therefore, will depend on future experiments more comprehensively comparing performance between the two tasks. In addition, the sample for this study was small: only eight subjects were tested, of which five reported previous exposure to psilocybin. There is no reason to expect that prior psilocybin use would have affected performance on the task, however, this possibility cannot be ruled out without consideration of a larger sample size allowing for a comparison between psilocybin-naı ¨ve subjects and those with prior experience. Impulsivity and Psychosis One final area warranting further investigation is the effect of psilocybin on impulsivity. There is considerable evidence connecting the serotonergic system to impulsivity (Carli & Samanin, 2000; Soubrie ´, 1986; Linnoila et al., 1983 ). Although we did not specifically measure response times in this study, it seems unlikely that the performance deficit observed reflected errors resulting directly from response impulsivity, as both measures would be expected to be equally susceptible to premature response errors and because response times are consistently increased by psilocybin (Carter et al., 2005; Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al., 2002; Vollenweider et al., 1998) . However, it is possible that the attentional deficits observed here are related to more complex characteristics of impulsivity generally associated with measures of attention such as decreased latent inhibition (an animal's capacity to ignore stimuli that experience has shown are irrelevant to its needs) (Lorden, Rickert, & Berry, 1983) , behavioral/response inhibition (Carli & Samanin, 2000; Harrison et al., 1997) , and distractibility (Oades, Slusarek, Velling, & Bondy, 2002) . In addition to impulsivity, the results are also relevant to current models of psychosis and the development of related pharmacological therapies. Psilocybin has previously been considered as a transient ''model'' form of psychosis (Vollenweider & Geyer, 2001) . Not only is there evidence of some overlap in the symptomatology between the psilocybin state and psychotic episodes, but it is also the case that a number of antipsychotic medications target the same 5-HT receptors activated by psilocybin (for review, see Roth, Hanizavareh, & Blum, 2004) . Generalized cognitive and attentional deficits are common symptoms in a number of clinical conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (Clayton et al., 1999; Martinot et al., 1990) , autism (Sturm et al., 2004) , attention deficit disorder (Barkley, 1997) , and schizophrenia (Addington & Addington, 1998; Nuechterlein & Dawson, 1984) . Therefore, a better understanding of the pharmacology underlying these attentional processes may offer new insight for potential drug therapies. Conclusion A variety of evidence suggests that attention, working memory, and serotonin are functionally and anatomically intertwined. The finding that a moderate dose of the 5-HT 1A /2A agonist psilocybin selectively impairs attentional tracking but not spatial working memory performance offers an initial attempt to tease these elements apart. Further work is still needed to investigate the proposition that the key effect of psilocybin on attention is a weakening of the capacity to filter out irrelevant stimuli, leading to increases in distractibility and reduced inhibition. METHODS Subjects Eight healthy volunteers (5 men, 3 women) aged between 21 and 31 (mean = 27.0, SD = 2.7) were recruited through advertisement from the local university and technical college. After being informed by a written and oral description of the aim, procedures, and possible risks associated with the study, all volunteers were asked to give their written consent as a requirement of participation. All subjects had normal or corrected-tonormal vision and were of good physical health as assessed by medical history, clinical examination, electrocardiography, and blood analysis. They were also deemed by psychiatric interview to have no personal or family (first-degree relatives) history of major psychiatric disorders or evidence for regular alcohol or substance abuse. Five of the participants reported having previous experience with psilocybin through the ingestion of psilocybe mushrooms; the other three were psilocybin-naı ¨ve. Subjects were reimbursed for their time and they were informed that at any time they were free to withdraw from the study. Substance and Dosing Psilocybin was obtained through the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. Capsules of psilocybin (1 and 5 mg) and ketanserin (50 mg) were prepared at the pharmacy of the Cantonal Hospital of Aarau, Switzerland, and quality was controlled through tests for iden-tity, purity, and uniformity of content. The psilocybin dose (215 Ag/kg), ketanserin (50 mg), and lactose placebo were administered in gelatin capsules of identical appearance. The doses of psilocybin and ketanserin used in the present study were chosen because they had previously been shown to induce and block the associated changes in conscious state, respectively (Vollenweider et al., 1998) . In order to ensure occupancy of the 5-HT 2A receptor, ketanserin was administered 90 min prior to psilocybin. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Psychiatry, Zurich, and the use of psilocybin was authorized by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Bern. Stimulus and Procedures Attention-Multiple-object Tracking Subjects viewed a Sony Trinitron Multiscan E215 monitor (44 cm) from a distance of approximately 60 cm. Twenty disks (18 diameter) moved across the gray screen in Brownian-like motion, at a constant speed of 68/sec. Every 30 msec the trajectory of all dots changed independently by an angle drawn at random from a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation of 118. When the dots collided, they appeared to bounce off each other or with the edges of the screen. At the beginning of each trial, the ''distracter'' (irrelevant) dots were colored green and the ''target'' dots (those to be tracked) were colored red. Subjects initiated a trial by pressing a mouse key, causing the red disks to become green and continue their random walk for 3 sec. They then all stopped, and four dots-one target and three distracters-were highlighted orange. The subject indicated which of the four dots had been a target using the mouse cursor. A feedback tone indicated an incorrect response. In each block of trials, the target number was initially set at 2, increasing gradually up to 8, with 4 repetitions for each target number. Three blocks were run in each testing session, yielding a total of 84 trials. There was no fixation marker and although subjects were not explicitly required to maintain fixation, they were instructed to track the targets with their attention rather than their eyes. The stimulus was generated in Matlab, using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) . Spatial Working Memory Spatial working memory was assessed using the Spatial Span test taken from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). The Spatial Span test is a computerized version of Corsi's block tapping task (Milner, 1971) designed to measure spatial working memory span (Robbins et al., 1994; Sahakian & Owen, 1992) . For this test, nine white boxes (3 cm 2 ) arranged irregularly on a black background were presented on an Ilyama S500M1 monitor with an Elo IntelliTouch Touchscreen and internal serial controller. During each trial, a set number of the boxes were sequentially highlighted by a change in their color. Each box was highlighted for the duration of 3 sec and the period between each subsequent box highlighting was 0.5 sec (during which time all boxes were white). The color used was consistent within any trial but was alternated between trials. The subject was instructed to remember the order in which the boxes were highlighted and then reproduce it at the end of the trial by touching the boxes in the appropriate sequence. Subjects were initially presented with a sequence of two boxes, after this the trials became successively harder with one additional box being added after every correct response sequence (up to 9 boxes). In the case of an incorrect response, the following trial would repeat the same number of boxes. The test was terminated after three incorrect responses at the respective level. Each trial was initiated by the subject pressing the space bar and at the end of the trial the subject's response was cued by a beep. There was no maximum limit on response time, but a minimum limit of 1 sec between successive responses in the sequences was imposed. During the response sequence, each selected box was highlighted in the same color that had been used during the test sequence and a feedback tone was generated. As subjects were required to repeat the Spatial Span task a number of times over the 4 days of testing, four parallel versions of the test were used to reduce the possibility of the sequences becoming encoded in longterm memory. The four versions differed only in the sequence and color in which the boxes were highlighted. The order in which the parallel tests were presented was counterbalanced across the eight subjects and the four drug conditions. Psychological Ratings T h eA l t e r e dS t a t eo fC o n s c i o u s n e s s( 5 D -A S C )r a t i n g scale (Dittrich et al., 1999; Dittrich, 1998) was used to assess the subjective effects under the four drug conditions as it had previously been shown to be sensitive to psychological effects of psilocybin in humans (Hasler et al., 2004; Vollenweider et al., 1998; Vollenweider et al., 1997) . The 5D-ASC rating scale is a visual analogue scale that measures alterations in waking consciousness, including changes in mood, perception, experience of oneself and of the environment, as well as disordered thought. The ASC scale consisted of 94 individual statements such as ''I heard tones and noises without knowing where they came from'' and subjects were required to mark their current state along a 100-mm line between ''No, not more than normal'' or ''Yes very much more than normal.'' Each of the 94 items was given a score from 0 to 100, reflecting the distance of the mark in millimeters from the end indicating no change. The items and their associated scores were grouped to yield five main scales (factors) comprising several item clusters: 1. ''Oceanic boundlessness'' (OB), measures derealization and depersonalization accompanied with changes in affect ranging from heightened mood to euphoria and/or exaltation, and alterations in the sense of time. 2. ''Anxious ego dissolution'' (AED) measures egodisintegration associated with loss of self-control, disordered thought, arousal, and anxiety. 3. ''Visionary restructuralization'' (VR) including elementary and complex hallucinations, synesthesia, and changed meaning of percepts. 4. ''Auditory alterations'' (AA) refers to acoustic hallucinations and distortions in auditory experiences. 5. ''Reduction of vigilance'' (RV) relates to states of drowsiness, reduced alertness, and impairment of cognitive function. Experimental Design The study was double-blind, placebo-controlled, with the order of dose assignment counterbalanced, and each of the four experimental days separated by at least 14 days. Before participating in either of the experimental conditions, subjects were taken through each of the measures to ensure that they were familiar and comfortable with all tests upon arrival for their first experimental day. For each of the four experiment days, subjects were instructed to have a light breakfast prior to arrival at the hospital. Before testing began, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and subsequently monitored at hourly intervals throughout the day. To obtain baseline ''pretest'' scores, subjects were tested on both the attentional tracking and working memory tasks. Following pretesting, the ketanserin/placebo capsules were ingested, and after a further 90 min, the placebo/ psilocybin capsules were administered. To minimize anxiety, subjects were then advised to relax and allow themselves to become comfortable with any perceptual or cognitive changes experienced. Because plasma levels of psilocybin's active metabolite psilocin peak approximately 105 ± 37 min after drug intake (Hasler et al., 1997) , subjects were retested on the tracking and working memory task 120 min after administration of psil o c y b i n .T h eo r d e ro ft e s t i n gf o rt h et w ot a s k sw a s sequentially alternated and counterbalanced. Subjects completed the 5D-ASC rating scale 180 min after drug administration and were thereby instructed to rate their experience since psilocybin intake (0-180 min). At pretest, 90-120 min postdrug intake and at a selection of additional intervals throughout the day, a number of other psychometric and psychophysical measures were administered but the results will be presented separately (Carter et al., submitted) . Subjects finished participation in the study approximately 7 hr after psilocybin consumption and were examined by the principal investigator before being deemed fit to be released. a g o n i s tk e t a n s e r i nw o u l dl e a dt oar e d u c t i o ni n any psilocybin-related changes in attentional tracking or spatial working memory. This is particularly relevant given the recent work implicating the 5-HT 2A Figure 2 . 2 Figure2. Results from the ASC questionnaire quantifying subjective effects experienced during placebo (white), psilocybin (black), psilocybin with ketanserin (black/gray stripes), and ketanserin alone (gray). The percentage of the total possible score relates to each of the five ASC main factors: oceanic boundlessness (OB), anxious ego dissolution (AED), visionary restructuralization (VR), auditory alterations (AA), and reduced vigilance (RV). Psilocybin caused significant changes, compared to placebo, in all factors except for AA. After pretreatment with ketanserin, the subjective effects of psilocybin were largely blocked with only RV remaining significantly elevated above placebo. Significant difference ( p < .05) from placebo is denoted by ''*,'' whereas differences between the psilocybin alone and psilocybin after pretreatment with ketanserin conditions are signalled by '' y .'' The fine bars represent measures of standard error. Figure 1 . 1 Figure1. Experimental stimuli. (A) During multipleobject tracking, subjects were presented with 20 moving dots on a gray background, of which a subset (between 2 and 8) were identified as targets by a difference in color (shown in black). The trial was initiated by the subject clicking the right mouse key, after which the target dots became visually indistinguishable from the other dots. After a period of 3 sec, the dots became stationary and one of the original target dots (targets shown with outline) and three nontargets were colored orange (shown in gray). Subjects were then forced to choose which one of these four orange dots was the target. (B) The spatial working memory stimuli comprised nine white boxes placed randomly on a black background. A set number of boxes (between 2 and 9) were sequentially highlighted by a change in their color (shown in gray). The subject's task was to reproduce the sequence by touching the respective boxes in the correct order. Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3. Psilocybin was found to significantly reduce attentional tracking performance and this effect was not diminished by pretreatment with ketanserin.

There was no significant difference between any of the other time or drug conditions.

Individual data showing reduction in relative performance after psilocybin administration for attentional tracking (ordinate) plotted against spatial working memory (abscissa). The estimates of performance reduction were calculated as the ratio of pretest to the 120-min peak testing for the psilocybin condition. The respective symbols and regression line for the two conditions are: placebo = white square (dashed gray line) and psilocybin = black square (black line). The data point enclosed in a circle was treated as an outlier and not included in calculating the regression line. The arrows show the respective mean reduction in performance for the psilocybin condition. The vertical and horizontal dashed lines passing through unity correspond to no drug effect. The lack of correlation between the two tasks after psilocybin administration is further support that psilocybin leads to a functional dissociation between attentional tracking and spatial working memory.

Main Text Animals flexibly adapt their behaviours in response to variable contextual changes in the environment. One prototypical adaptive behaviour is value-guided decisionmaking, which relies on diverse neural systems thought to realise key computations, such as the assignment of value to specific stimulus-action pairs based on rewardhistory. Failure to adapt behaviour is a common symptom in many neurological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia 1 . In mammals, value-guided decisionmaking is governed by distributed neural circuits engaging cognitive primitives in prefrontal areas of the neocortex 2, 3 . The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is particularly implicated in cognitive evaluation of stimulus-outcome associations [4] [5] [6] [7] . OFC is a key higher-order association area that has been shown to have extensive connections with sensory cortices as well as subcortical structures of the reward system 8, 9 . However, how neuronal populations in OFC encode decision-related variables and dynamically engage in flexible decision-making upon changes in reward contingencies is poorly understood. It is also unclear whether and how OFC neurons hierarchically instruct sensory areas to remap their activity for the refinement of sensory representations to support value-guided adaptive behaviour. To study the neural dynamics underlying flexible decision-making, we employed a reversal learning paradigm based on tactile discrimination. We trained mice in a whisker-based 'go/no-go' texture-discrimination task 10 (Fig. 1a ; coarse P100 sandpaper as go-texture vs. smooth P1200 sandpaper as no-go-texture; Methods). Once task performance reached expert level (discriminability index (d') > 1.5; Methods), we implemented a 'rule-switch' by reversing stimulus-reward contingency (Fig. 1b ). Mice reached high d' values during initial learning (from 'learning naïve', LN, through 'learning expert', LE), decreased performance after reversal, and regained high d' values after re-learning the task (from 'reversal naïve', RN, through 'reversal expert', RE) (Fig. 1c , Supplementary Fig. 1 , n = 11 mice). Reversal learning was significantly faster than the initial learning and the performance remained stable over weeks (Fig. 1d , Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Task performance depended on sensory input and was independent of initial go-texture (n = 3 mice trained first on P1200 texture; Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Mice developed anticipatory whisking as well as well-timed licking during initial learning 11 . Following the rule-switch, the overall whisking kinematics did not change as they maintained the whisking-for-touch strategy but transiently reverted to uncertain and delayed licking before regaining confidence in the RE period (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). We focused on two cortical areas implicated in task-learning: barrel cortex in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which is important for tactile discrimination and sensory learning 12 , and the lateral OFC, for its role in credit-assignment 8 . To examine the behavioural and causal relevance of these two areas, we expressed inhibitory DREADD receptors (hM4Di) in excitatory neurons in either S1 or lateral OFC (for histology and electrophysiological validation, see Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 ). Inhibition of S1 neurons during initial training (via daily CNO injections before each behavioural training sessions during LN and LE periods) prevented mice from learning the discrimination task (Fig. 1f ). On the other hand, inhibiting neurons in the lateral OFC, but not medial OFC 7 , after the rule-switch (during RN and RE periods) impaired reversal learning and increased perseverative errors (Fig. 1f-g , Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, lateral OFC-silenced mice were still able to learn a new stimulus-outcome association after introduction of a novel P600 sandpaper as rewarded go-texture (Fig. 1g ). Overall, these results indicate a dissociation of neural mechanisms of learning and reversal learning distributed across cortical areas involving the S1 and lateral OFC, respectively. To directly probe neuronal activity in lateral OFC and S1 during learning and reversal learning, we performed in vivo two-photon Ca 2+ imaging in transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6f in superficial excitatory layer (L)2/3 neurons. We targeted lateral OFC, which resides deep in the frontal cortex 13, 14 , by imaging via a gradientindex lens that was inserted through a chronically implanted cannula (Fig. 2a ; Supplementary Fig. 5 ; Methods, n = 4 mice). Cannula-implanted mice showed no noticeable impairments in whisking and in simple behavioural tests (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). We observed large Ca 2+ transients in lateral OFC neurons with trial-related activity especially during the reward-outcome window (Fig. 2a ). An example neuron that was longitudinally measured across all behavioural phases displayed large and robust Ca 2+ responses to the unexpected rewards for the new go-texture after the rule-switch (RN), whereas only a modest increase in reward-related activity was found during initial learning (LE) (Fig. 2b ). This high RN activity was transient and decreased as the task performance increased during the RE period. The same response pattern was evident when averaging across all OFC neurons, with a significant increase in reward-related Ca 2+ transient amplitude after the rule-switch (LEàRN; Fig. 2c ). These findings are consistent with lateral OFC developing a representation of outcome-value that is strongly visible upon rule-switch 15 . In line with this notion, OFC neuronal responses to a third texture type (P600), associated with a constant small reward both before and after reversal, remained unchanged in control experiments (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). In stark contrast, L2/3 neurons in S1, imaged through a chronic cranial window (n = 5 mice), exhibited abundant Ca 2+ activity during both the stimulus-presentation as well as the reward-outcome window (Fig. 2d ). Rewarded go-texture-related Ca 2+ transients emerged during initial task-learning (LNàLE), decreased directly after the rule-switch, and re-appeared for the new gotexture in the RE period (an example neuron in Fig. 2e ). This response remapping was also observed when averaging across all S1 L2/3 neurons (Fig. 2f ). Notably, similar response profile was also found in anatomically identified S1àOFC projection neurons targeted via a dual viral labelling strategy (n = 3 mice; Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Together with neural responses, the fraction of active neurons was highest for LE and RN phases in the lateral OFC and LE and RE phases in S1, suggesting strong involvement and dissociation of the two regions in these respective salient behavioural phases (Fig. 2c and f ). Taking advantage of longitudinal activity measurements from the same neurons across weeks, we further examined the heterogeneity of neuronal responses in lateral OFC and S1 and their stability or flexibility upon rule-switch. A key question is whether neurons which preferentially respond to hit-trials after initial learning will retain response selectivity for the new or the old go-texture after reversal, i.e. whether they remain more stimulus-selective or outcome-selective. To quantify response selectivity of active neurons, we defined an ROC-based hit/CR selectivity index (SI) that ranges from -1 and +1 (significance tested by permutation test, p < 0.05; Methods; Supplementary Fig. 8 ) 16 . We focused on hit/CR SI values for the reward-outcome window. Note that the hit/CR SI per se cannot distinguish between stimulus-and outcome-selectivity because these trial-types differ in both texture-type and action-outcome. However, by comparing SI values before and after the ruleswitch we can reveal whether a neuron's new-hit/CR SI reverses sign (indicating stimulus-selectivity) or remains similar (indicating outcome-selectivity). Figure 3a schematically plots the 5 major classes of SI changes that can be illustrated in a 2D before-after plot. Note that each neuron may show a mixture of stimulus-and outcome-selectivity, which are given by the projection components onto the two diagonals. We consider here only the major classes. To not only assess how neurons immediately react to the rule-switch but also how they may adapt during re-learning of the task, we assigned each neuron twice to these classes of SI changes (comparing LEàRN and LEààRE, respectively; Fig. 3a ). Among 107 chronically imaged lateral OFC neurons (n = 3 mice), we found a high fraction of outcomeselective neurons, which tracked outcome-value by responding strongly in the newhit trials immediately following rule-switch in the RN period (Fig. 3b-c ). Some OFC neurons also lost selectivity while others gained selectivity. This functional selectivity for the new go-texture (LEààRE), we did not observe such recruitment for S1 neurons in lateral OFC-silenced mice (Supplementary Fig. 9 ; Methods). This analysis further confirms that S1 remapping crucially depends on top-down OFC input. Finally, we examined the mechanism of how lateral OFC governs S1 remapping by analysing the influence of error-modulation and history-dependence. Most lateral OFC neurons that responded strongly to new-hit trials also displayed enhanced response in FA trials in early phases of reversal (RN) indicating the errordependent nature of OFC computation (Fig. 4d-e ). Since OFC neurons integrate recent reward-history 22 , we also studied intrinsic features of value-sensitive neurons in both lateral OFC and S1. We computed a 'reward-history modulation index' (RHMI) for each neuronal subclass by comparing responses of each of the 'hit' trials that were immediately preceded by a 'hit' or an 'FA' trial (Fig. 4f ; Methods). While outcome-selective neurons in the lateral OFC showed a significant reward-historydependent response modulation before (LE) and after (RN) the rule-switch, S1 neurons with both outcome-selectivity and acquired-selectivity, but no other subclasses, were modulated by reward-history in RE. Interestingly, historydependent modulation was absent in S1 neurons in OFC-silenced mice indicating that higher-order top-down input from the lateral OFC is critical for the intrinsic functional reorganisation of both outcome-selective and gain-selectivity neurons in S1 (Fig. 4g ; Supplementary Fig. 13 ). These findings corroborate the notion that encoding of outcome-value in the lateral OFC, as well as deviations from expected outcome-value, is critical for functional remapping of a selective subpopulation of S1 neurons for flexible decision-making. Adaptive behaviour is shaped by recent and accumulated sensory evidences, as well as predicted outcome-value of future choices. Predictive processing is critical for perception 19 and the OFC provides a 'cognitive map' functioning as an internal reference framework to compare and optimise a desired behavioural outcome such as reward 20, 21 . Reward value is computed in distributed parts of the brain 22 including the VTA 23 , frontal areas 7 , and primary and associational 17 sensory areas of the neocortex. Our experiments revealed a crucial role of mouse lateral OFC neurons in encoding outcome-value prediction error as a teaching signal for driving learning of an altered stimulus-reward contingency, partly resembling classical dopamine responses 23, 35 . Tracking both positive and negative outcome-values, OFC neurons may represent ongoing neural estimates of position on a value map 24 . Pharmacogenetic silencing revealed that lateral OFC has a critical causal role in implementing flexibility as previously shown in rodents 25 , as compared to non-human primates 26 . This implementation could be achieved via possible projection-specific interactions 27 with integrative cortical areas like the retrosplenial cortex 28 , and/or subcortical structures including the basolateral amygdala 27, 29 and the mediodorsal thalamus 30 . Our findings also crucially imply that S1 neurons do not simply function as sensory feature detectors 31 . Whereas reward-sensitive neurons were to be expected in the higher-order cortex such as OFC, perhaps more importantly, we discovered a subpopulation of neurons in the primary sensory cortex that are differentially modulated by reward-history. The cellular and circuit mechanisms for a remarkable plasticity in this small subset of neurons, possibly involving neuromodulators such as serotonin 32 or long-range layer-specific excitatory and local inhibitory interactions 33 , remain to be determined. The existence of a reward-valence signal in the primary sensory cortex and their modulation by higher-order inputs has important implications for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms for brain machine interfaces 34 . Taken together, this study revealed crucial cellular-level local interactive motifs and long-range circuit interactions behind adaptive plasticity and flexible decision-making.

In S1, on the contrary, stimulus-selective neurons were more abundant than outcome-selective neurons in the RN period (18% of active neurons among 218 chronically imaged neurons; n = 4 mice; Fig. 3e-f ). During reversal learning, however, the selectivity distribution of S1 neurons changed markedly. A large subpopulation had switched their selectivity in the RE period, compared to the RN period, functionally remapping to the new stimulus-outcome contingency (Fig. 3g ; Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Moreover, a subpopulation of previously inactive or non-selective neurons acquired high outcome-selectivity for the newly rewarded go-texture. Identified S1àOFC projection neurons showed similar selectivity changes (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). A similar analysis of texture-touchevoked responses in the stimulus-presentation window likewise revealed an overall remapping towards the new go-texture from the RN through the RE period (Supplementary Fig. 11 ). The link of functional subclasses to behavioural variables, especially reward-modulation of neurons with outcome-selectivity in RE, was further confirmed by GLM analysis 17 (Supplementary Fig. 12 ; Methods). These results suggest that lateral OFC neurons exhibit a value-guided response immediately following a rule-switch. In contrast, a subpopulation of S1 neurons initially retains the learned stimulus-value association and is functionally remapped only upon relearning. Is the delayed remapping in S1 causally dependent on the activity in the lateral OFC? To investigate whether direct long-range OFCàS1 anatomical projections exist in mice, we injected retrograde AAV-retro/2-tdTomato into L2/3 of S1. Analysis of cleared brains (n = 2) using whole-brain light-sheet microscopy 18 revealed dense S1-projecting neurons primarily in L2/3 and L5 of the lateral OFC (Fig. 4a ). Chemogenetic silencing of lateral OFC neurons after the rule-switch (RN through RE) impaired functional remapping of S1 neurons (Fig. 4b ; Supplementary Fig. 9 ; n = 4 mice). The effect is best seen in the marginal distributions for the three salient learning periods. Unlike control S1 neurons, a significant fraction of S1 neurons in OFC-silenced mice preserved their selectivity for the previous go-texture and failed to reconfigure responses towards the new go-texture in RE, with no significant difference observed in LE (cumulative distributions, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) (Fig. 4c ). Lateral OFC silencing also affected RNàRE remapping of texture touch-evoked Ca 2+ responses in the stimulus-presentation window (Supplementary Fig. 11 ). We P Fettes L Schulze Downar J. Front. Syst.

INTRODUCTION Identifying the molecular features that define cellular identities is a fundamental goal of biological research. Consequently, several 'bottom-up' methods have been developed to isolate cells for molecular profiling, including fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), immunopanning (IP), and sorting of single cells (SC) or nuclei (SN). Although these methods are readily applied to many biological systems, their applicability to the adult human CNS is limited by technical factors and practical considerations. For example, FACS, IP, and SC typically require fresh tissue and have therefore been mostly limited to surgical samples from a handful of CNS regions and individuals [1] [2] [3] . SN 4, 5 is compatible with frozen tissue but, like SC, suffers from technical noise caused by tissue dissociation, nucleus/cell capture, cDNA preamplification, and stochastic transcript coverage 6 . Furthermore, there is a trade-off between sequencing depth and the number of nuclei/cells that can be analyzed. The adult human CNS is large, heterogeneous, and difficult to dissociate due to extensive myelin. It consists of ~170 billion cells, about half of which are neurons 7 . The remaining cells consist mostly of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, which are collectively referred to as glia. Identifying transcriptional differences among neuronal and glial subtypes is an important goal, since heterogeneity within CNS cell classes is incompletely understood. However, it is equally important to understand what CNS cell subtypes have in common. For example, is there a core set of genes whose expression is shared among all neurons? All astrocytes? Etc. Answering these questions will fill critical gaps in our understanding of CNS cell biology, produce novel experimental and analytical strategies, and provide important insights into the cellular origins of CNS pathologies. Most studies of human CNS transcriptomes have analyzed intact postmortem samples. Because these samples are heterogeneous and cells must be destroyed to extract RNA, it is often assumed that these datasets contain no information about the cellular origins of gene expression. However, it is axiomatic that intact tissue samples from any biological system will exhibit variable cellular composition. Therefore, when many intact tissue samples are analyzed, genes expressed with the greatest sensitivity and specificity in the same cell class should appear highly correlated, since their expression levels depend primarily on the proportion of that cell class in each sample 8 . In support of this reasoning, which has motivated numerous in silico deconvolution strategies [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , we previously discovered highly reproducible gene coexpression modules in microarray data from intact human brain samples that were significantly enriched with markers of major CNS cell classes 16 . These findings were replicated in studies of intact CNS transcriptomes from mice 17 , rats 18 , zebra finches 19 , macaques 20 , and humans 21 . Gene coexpression modules corresponding to major cell classes are therefore robust and predictable features of CNS transcriptomes derived from intact tissue samples. Furthermore, the same genes consistently show the strongest affinities for these modules, offering substantial information about the molecular correlates of cellular identity 16 . Over the past decade, thousands of intact, neurotypical human samples from every major CNS region have been transcriptionally profiled. These data provide an unprecedented opportunity to determine the core transcriptional features of cellular identity in the human CNS from the 'top down' by integrating cell-class-specific gene coexpression modules from many independent datasets. RESULTS Gene coexpression analysis of synthetic brain samples accurately predicts differential expression among CNS cell classes To illustrate the premise of our approach, we aggregated SC RNA-seq data from adult human brain 1 to create synthetic samples that mimic the heterogeneity of intact tissue (Fig. 1A ). We performed unsupervised gene coexpression analysis to identify gene coexpression modules in each synthetic dataset that were maximally enriched with published markers 22, 23 of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, or neurons ('cell-class modules'; Fig. 1A ). Intuitively, expression variation in a cell-class module primarily depends on the representation of that cell class in each sample. Mathematically, the vector that explains the most variation in a coexpression module is its first principal component, or module 'eigengene' (Fig. 1A ) 24 . This reasoning suggests that a cell-class module eigengene should approximate the relative abundance of that cell class in each sample. Because the precise cellular composition of each synthetic sample was known, we tested this hypothesis and found that actual cellular abundance was nearly indistinguishable from that predicted by cell-class module eigengenes (Fig. S1A ). To determine the affinity of each gene for each cell-class module, we calculated the Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis measure of intramodular connectivity, k ME 25 . k ME is defined as the Pearson correlation between the expression pattern of a gene and a module eigengene. In the special situation of a cell-class module, k ME therefore quantifies the similarity between the expression pattern of a gene and the relative abundance of that cell class in each sample. Because each sample is a heterogeneous mixture of cells, high k ME for a cell-class module suggests that expression of the gene in that cell class is sensitive and specific. We tested this hypothesis by performing differential expression analysis of SC RNA-seq data for each cell class, restricting our analysis to exactly the same cells used to construct the synthetic samples. As shown in Fig. 1B , the genes that are most significantly up-regulated in a cell class also have the highest k ME values for the corresponding cell-class module. We obtained nearly identical results by aggregating SC RNA-seq data from adult mouse brain 26 (Fig. S1B, C ). These findings demonstrate that gene coexpression analysis of intact CNS samples can determine which genes are most differentially expressed among CNS cell classes. More generally, our results suggest that it is not always necessary to physically isolate cells in order to ascertain their defining transcriptional features. Integrative gene coexpression analysis of intact tissue samples reveals consensus transcriptional profiles of major CNS cell classes in humans To determine consensus transcriptional profiles of human CNS cell classes, we analyzed 7221 CNS transcriptomes from 840 neurotypical adult humans by combining data from eight studies 21, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] and one resource (http://www.brainspan.org/). These data were generated from intact postmortem tissue samples using diverse technology platforms (Table S1 ) and collectively represent billions of cells. Each sample was assigned to one of 19 broad neuroanatomical regions, resulting in 62 regional datasets (Fig. 1C ). After data preprocessing and quality control, each dataset consisted of ≥25 samples (median: 76) (Table S1 ). For each dataset, we performed unsupervised gene coexpression analysis and identified the module that was maximally enriched with published markers 22, 23 of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, or neurons (Fig. 1D , Table S2 ). PC1 of these modules was used to estimate the relative abundance of each cell class over all samples and calculate genome-wide k ME values (Fig. 1E, F ). Finally, we combined k ME values for significant cell-class modules from all 62 datasets, producing a single value (z-score) for each gene that quantifies its global expression fidelity for each cell class (Fig. 1G ). Importantly, estimates of fidelity were highly robust to the choice of gene set used for enrichment analysis (especially for glia; Fig. S2 ). Canonical markers consistently had high fidelity for the expected cell class and low fidelity for other cell classes (Fig. 2A-D ). Highfidelity genes were also significantly and specifically enriched with expected cell-class markers from multiple independent studies (Fig. 2A-D ). Compared to glia, the distribution of expression fidelity for neurons was compressed (Fig. 2A-D ), likely reflecting neuronal heterogeneity among CNS regions. Genome-wide estimates of expression fidelity for major cell classes are provided in Table S3 and on our web site (http://oldhamlab.ctec.ucsf.edu/). To further explore how estimates of gene expression fidelity derived from intact tissue relate to gene expression in individual cells, we analyzed droplet-based SN RNA-seq data from neurotypical adult human brains. Habib et al. 4 analyzed 14963 nuclei from cortical and hippocampal samples from five individuals, detecting a median of 529 unique genes/ nucleus. Lake et al. 34 analyzed 35289 nuclei from cortical and cerebellar samples from six individuals, detecting a median of 719 unique genes/nucleus. In general, expression patterns of high-fidelity genes were conserved in SN RNA-seq data (Fig. 2E ). We extended these comparisons by examining concordance among top high-fidelity genes and top differentially expressed genes for each cell class from each SN study (Fig. 2F-I ). For all comparisons, overlap was highly significant (p < 10 -15 ), but less so for neurons, which likely reflects differences among CNS regions analyzed in each study. Given the shallow coverage that characterizes droplet-based SC/SN methods, we hypothesized that discordant results might also represent type II error in SN RNA-seq data (i.e. dropouts). To test this hypothesis, we compared expression levels of discordant and concordant genes. For all cell classes, discordant genes were expressed significantly lower than concordant genes in our collection of 7221 intact human CNS samples (Fig. 2F-M ). Furthermore, discordant genes were detected far less frequently than concordant genes in single nuclei from both studies (Fig. S3 ). For an orthogonal perspective, we analyzed expression of discordant genes in cell classes purified by immunopanning from adult human temporal lobe surgical resections 3 . In all cases, gene expression fidelity correctly predicted the dominant cellular source of mRNA (Fig. 2N-Q ). These results underscore the sparse nature of current droplet-based SN RNAseq data. Comparisons of fidelity and differential expression results for all genes are reported in Table S4 . High-fidelity genes reveal the core transcriptional identities of major CNS cell classes in humans The genes with the highest expression fidelity for major CNS cell classes are consistently coexpressed across regions and technology platforms (Fig. S4 ). We visualized the top 50 genes ranked by expression fidelity for each cell class to compare their expression levels, mutation intolerance, literature citations, cellular localization, and protein-protein interactions (PPI) (Fig. 3A-D ). Overall, expression levels of high-fidelity genes were highest for neurons and lowest for microglia (Fig. 3A -D, red tracks). However, each cell class had a wide range of expression levels for high-fidelity genes, suggesting parallel regulatory mechanisms and/or differential transcript stability. To assess the tolerance of high-fidelity genes to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, we analyzed data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), which summarizes the prevalence of coding mutations in ~61K human exomes 35 . Unexpectedly, high-fidelity neuronal genes were significantly less tolerant to LoF mutations than high-fidelity glial genes (Fig. 3A -D, black tracks). We then searched PubMed to determine whether highfidelity genes have been studied in their respective cell classes (Fig. 3A -D, green tracks). Interestingly, many searches returned no citations, highlighting critical gaps in our understanding of CNS cell biology. For example, the top microglial gene (amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 1 interacting protein, or APBB1IP) is unstudied in microglia. We also examined the cellular localization of proteins 36 encoded by high-fidelity genes. Among those shown in Fig. 3A -D, membrane localization was reported for 33 in astrocytes, 22 in oligodendrocytes, and 30 in microglia, but only 13 in neurons (inside track). This result may reflect the homeostatic functions of glia as regulators of extracellular CNS environments. More generally, the non-random distributions of cellular localizations suggest that high-fidelity genes are expressed as proteins in their corresponding cell classes. Indeed, PPI 37 among high-fidelity gene products for each cell class revealed significantly more interactions than expected by chance (Fig. 3A -D, interior lines). Because high-fidelity genes should encode optimal biomarkers, we searched for high-fidelity genes in the Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org) to identify novel reagents for labeling human CNS cell classes. We identified validated antibodies for PON2 (astrocytes), DBNDD2 (oligodendrocytes), APBB1IP (microglia), and CELF2 (neurons) (Fig. 3A-D ). Dual immunostaining with canonical markers revealed almost perfect concordance in human frontal cortex (Fig. 3E-H ; Fig. S5 ). Gene coexpression analysis of intact tissue samples reveals the core transcriptional features of diverse CNS cell classes Variation among intact tissue samples can also reveal transcriptional features of less abundant human CNS cell classes. Following the general strategy outlined in Fig. 1 , we calculated genome-wide expression fidelity for human cholinergic neurons, midbrain dopaminergic neurons, endothelial cells, ependymal cells, choroid plexus cells, mural cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and Purkinje neurons (Figs. 4, S6; Table S3 ). This analysis correctly assigned high fidelity scores for canonical markers of these cells. For example, choline acetyltransferase (CHAT), the high-affinity choline transporter (SLC5A7), and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VACHT) all ranked within the top ~0.2% for genomewide cholinergic neuron expression fidelity, while claudin 5 (CLDN5), tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin like and EGF like domains 1 (TIE1), and platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) all ranked within the top ~0.3% for genome-wide endothelial cell expression fidelity (Table S3 ). High-fidelity genes were significantly and specifically enriched with published markers of each cell class from multiple independent studies; furthermore, novel markers predicted by our analysis were validated by in situ hybridization in adult mouse brain 38 (Figs. 4, S6) . High-fidelity genes enable predictive modeling of gene expression in transcriptomes from intact tissue samples The reproducibility of gene coexpression modules corresponding to major cell classes (Table S2 , Fig. S4 ) suggests that transcriptomes of intact CNS samples can be modeled as a function of cellular abundance. We explored this topic systematically by performing multiple linear regression in 47 CNS datasets with ≥40 samples to determine how much expression variation in a shared set of ~9600 genes could be explained by variation in the abundance of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. To estimate the relative abundance of each cell class in each dataset, we summarized the expression patterns of highfidelity genes (Fig. 5A ). To avoid circularity, we used a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to redefine high-fidelity genes for each dataset by recalculating expression fidelity for each cell class using the remaining 46 datasets (as in Fig. 1C-G ). More aggressive exclusion criteria (e.g. excluding 90% of datasets before redefining high-fidelity genes) produced nearly identical results (Fig. S7 ). Before modeling, each dataset was downsampled (n=40) to facilitate comparisons of results; this process was performed iteratively to ensure robustness (Fig. 5A ). Implementing this strategy, we obtained several important results (Fig. 5B ). First, using only one gene (with the highest fidelity) as a surrogate for each cell class, our models explained 32.2% of total transcriptional variation averaged over all datasets and up to ~50% in some datasets (vs. ~0.1% for permuted data). Second, increasing the number of gene surrogates/ cell class (e.g. using the top 10 or top 50 high-fidelity genes) provided only modest performance improvements (unless otherwise stated, subsequent models used the top 10 high-fidelity genes). Third, prediction accuracy depended strongly on technology platform (p<10 -7 , ANOVA) but not CNS region (p=0.92, ANOVA). Among microarrays, older platforms fared substantially worse than newer platforms, while RNA-seq generally outperformed all microarrays. Despite their simplicity, our models explained >50% of expression variation, averaged over all datasets, for ~2000 genes (Fig. 5C ). Over all genes, the average amount of expression variation explained by our models followed a sigmoid function (Fig. 5C ). We benchmarked model performance against the maximal explanatory power of any four predictors by using PC1-4 from each dataset as covariates for multiple regression. On average, PC1-4 explained 49.6% of total gene expression variation over all datasets (Fig. 5B ). Thus, modeling gene expression in the human CNS as a function of neuron, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, and microglia abundance achieved, on average, 72.0% of the maximal explanatory power for all datasets and 80.1% for RNA-seq datasets (Fig. 5B ). We reasoned that model performance for RNA-seq might exceed that for microarrays since the latter have many probes for transcripts unlikely to be expressed in the CNS. We therefore stratified genes by expression levels and examined model performance. As expected, predictive power decreased at lower expression levels, with the sharpest decline between the 3rd and 4th quartiles (Fig. 5D ). We next explored how transcriptional variation related to variation in the abundance of individual cell classes, sex, and age. Neuronal abundance explained more transcriptional variation than glial abundance (Fig. 5E ). After controlling for variation in the abundance of major cell classes, model performance did not substantially improve by including sex or age as covariates (Fig. 5E ). We further explored this topic by correlating estimated cellular abundance with age in 32 CNS datasets. Neuronal and oligodendroglial abundance were negatively correlated with age, while astrocytic and microglial abundance were positively correlated (Fig. 5F ). These results suggest that age-related changes in gene expression in bulk CNS transcriptomes are primarily driven by age-related changes in cellular composition. Gene expression modeling applications The ability to predict gene expression in transcriptomes from intact CNS samples has important implications. We illustrate the versatility of this approach through comparative analysis of gene expression models in disease, among CNS regions, and between species. Application #1: Contextualizing disease genes and modeling gene expression in pathological samples We asked whether genes associated with CNS diseases 39 are enriched among genes primarily expressed by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, or neurons (Fig. 6A-B ). Clustering select CNS diseases by enrichment p-values revealed several interesting findings. First, except for ALS, genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders were most enriched among genes expressed by microglia and astrocytes. Second, genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders were most enriched among genes expressed by astrocytes and neurons. Third, genes expressed by astrocytes consistently showed the greatest enrichment with candidate CNS disease genes. Beyond broad associations between diseases and cell classes, gene expression modeling can also reveal which cell classes are most likely to express candidate disease genes. For example, we modeled gene expression for Alzheimer's diseases (AD) risk genes as a function of neuronal, oligodendroglial, astrocytic, and microglial abundance in transcriptomes from intact neurotypical adult human temporal cortex (Fig. 6C ). Expression levels of early-onset AD risk genes APP and PSEN1 were mostly explained by variation in neuronal and oligodendroglial abundance, respectively. In contrast, expression levels of lateonset AD risk genes APOE and TREM2 were mostly explained by variation in astrocytic and microglial abundance, respectively. These results were consistent across 47 CNS datasets (Fig. 6D ). Compared to control (CTRL) human brain samples, AD samples should contain fewer neurons and proportionately more glia. We tested this hypothesis by using expression patterns of high-fidelity genes to infer the relative abundance of neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in three gene expression datasets from intact postmortem brain samples of CTRL and AD subjects [40] [41] [42] . We observed a highly significant decrease in neuronal abundance in AD in all datasets (Figs. 6E, S8A-B). In two out of three datasets, there were significant increases in the relative abundance of astrocytes and microglia in AD, with similar trends in the third (Figs. 6E, S8A-B). Interestingly, there were no significant differences in oligodendrocyte abundance between CTRL and AD in any dataset (Figs. 6E, S8A-B). Importantly, simulations revealed that estimates of cellular abundance were robust to a wide range of transcriptional dysregulation among genes used to derive these estimates (Fig. S9 ). This strategy can help determine whether variable cellular composition is associated with diverse CNS disorders. Because AD brain samples have fewer neurons and proportionately more astrocytes/ microglia than CTRL, differential expression analysis of intact tissue samples will reveal down-regulation of neuronal transcripts and up-regulation of astrocytic/microglial transcripts. However, predictive modeling can identify cell-intrinsic transcriptional differences between CTRL and AD that are independent of changes in cellular composition. This strategy is analogous to that of Kuhn et al. 11 , except we use expression patterns of highfidelity genes to estimate cellular abundance. Surprisingly, after controlling for differences in cellular composition between CTRL and AD, we identified many genes that were consistently up-regulated in AD neurons (Fig. 6F , Table S5 ). These genes did not include canonical AD risk genes (Fig. S8C ), but rather genes involved in protein ubiquitination, catabolism, proteasome degradation, and mitochondrial function (Fig. S8D ). Examples are shown in Figs. 6G, S8 . Application #2: Identifying transcriptional differences in major cell classes among CNS regions We recalculated expression fidelity for each CNS region with ≥3 datasets and clustered each cell class (Fig. 7A-D ). Regional differences in expression fidelity were greatest for neurons, with bifurcation between cortical/subcortical structures (Fig. 7D-E ). In contrast, oligodendrocyte expression fidelity was very similar among brain regions (Fig. 7B, E ). Comparatively, microglia and astrocytes exhibited more regional variation in expression fidelity than oligodendrocytes, but less than neurons (Fig. 7A, C, E ). We developed a conservative strategy to identify binary expression differences in major cell classes among human brain regions (Fig. 7F -G, Table S6 ). Many genes were predicted to distinguish regional subpopulations of neurons, but we found no evidence for binary expression differences among regional subpopulations of microglia or oligodendrocytes (Figs. 7H, S10 ). However, we did predict binary expression differences among regional subpopulations of human astrocytes (Fig. 7H-I ). For example, CHRDL1 was predicted to be expressed by astrocytes in frontal cortex and striatum, but not diencephalon or midbrain (Fig. 7I-K ). To validate this prediction, we performed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for Chrdl1 and Aldh1l1 in mouse cortex and thalamus. Aldh1l1 is expressed ubiquitously by astrocytes 22 and was detected in both regions (Fig. 7J-L ). Expression of Chrdl1 colocalized with Aldh1l1 in mouse cortex but not thalamus (Fig. 7L ), as predicted. Application #3: Identifying transcriptional differences in major CNS cell classes between species We analyzed 1346 mouse brain transcriptomes to determine genome-wide expression fidelity for astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons (Tables S1, S7 ; Fig. S11 ). Expression fidelity was significantly correlated between mice and humans for each cell class, with the greatest similarity for neurons (Fig. 8A ). We note that evolutionary conservation of neuronal expression fidelity relative to glia is mirrored at the protein level (Fig. 3A-D , black tracks). These findings may indicate that neurons are under greater evolutionary constraint than glia. We applied stringent criteria and identified 50 genes predicted to be 'on' in human CNS cell classes and 'off' in the corresponding mouse CNS cell classes, as well as six genes with the opposite pattern (Fig. 8B , Table S8 ). ~85% of these differences were predicted to occur in glia (Fig. 8B ). We also analyzed 476 outgroup samples from chimpanzee and macaque brains (Table S1 ). Of the 50 genes predicted to be expressed in human but not mouse cell classes, 29 were significantly associated with the same cell class in at least one primate dataset; conversely, of the six genes with the opposite pattern, none was significantly associated with the same cell class in any primate dataset (Table S8 ). For example, expression variation of MRVI1 was largely explained by astrocyte abundance in primates, but not mice (Figs. 8B, S12A-B). Conversely, expression variation of PLA2G7 was largely explained by astrocyte abundance in mice, but not primates (Figs. 8B, S12A-B). Singlemolecule FISH confirmed that expression of MRVI1 and PLA2G7 is specific to human and mouse astrocytes, respectively (Fig. S12C-D ). To demonstrate the ability of our analyses to deliver functional insights into the unique biology of human brains, we focused on the unexplained fact that human astrocytes are much larger than mouse astrocytes (and non-human primate astrocytes) 43 . This phenotype has important implications for neuronal function, since one human astrocyte can encompass ~2MM synapses vs. ~100K synapses for one mouse astrocyte 43 . We reasoned that genes expressed by human but not mouse astrocytes might contribute to this phenotype. We were particularly intrigued by peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2; Fig. 8B ), which encodes a fatty-acid binding protein that maintains membrane lipid composition in Schwann cells 44 . In the human CNS, PMP2 expression was extremely high (mean percentile: 96.2) and largely explained by astrocyte abundance, while in the mouse CNS Pmp2 expression was effectively absent (mean percentile: 11.2) and unrelated to astrocyte abundance (Fig. 8B-D ). Furthermore, independent RNA-seq data from human, chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse neocortex 45 revealed a monotonic increase in PMP2 expression from mouse to human (Fig. 8E ). Immunostaining revealed widespread PMP2 in human neocortical astrocytes but no PMP2 in mouse neocortex (Fig. 8F ), despite robust expression by Schwann cells (Fig. S12E ). To test whether PMP2 could increase mouse astrocyte size in vivo, we delivered a viral construct expressing PMP2 under an astrocyte-specific promoter to neonatal mouse brains and analyzed the morphology of transduced astrocytes after 42d (Fig. 8G ). Forced expression of PMP2 in mouse astrocytes significantly increased their maximum diameter and number of primary processes (Fig. 8H-I ). The increase in maximum diameter corresponded to an increase in mouse astrocyte volume of ~50% (assuming sphericity). We repeated this experiment with a different viral construct and obtained nearly identical results (Fig. S12F ). To our knowledge, these data provide the first molecular explanation for morphological differences between human and mouse astrocytes. More generally, our findings illustrate how variation among intact tissue samples can predict cell-class-specific transcriptional features with important functional implications for human neurobiology. DISCUSSION We have described an approach to reveal the core transcriptional features of cellular identity via integrative gene coexpression analysis of intact tissue samples. Compared to 'bottom-up' methods such as FACS, IP, and SC/SN, the main advantages of our 'top-down' approach include: i) elimination of the need for fresh tissue; ii) applicability to huge amounts of existing data; iii) elimination of technical variability caused by tissue dissociation/cDNA preamplification; iv) elimination of sampling bias associated with cell/nucleus capture; v) ability to estimate the relative abundance of cell classes among intact tissue samples; and vi) ability to derive highly robust inferences about the core transcriptional features of cellular identity based on aggregate analysis of billions of cells. Our approach also has important limitations. False-positive associations can result from technical factors (e.g. batch effects) or biological factors such as cellular collinearity. For example, we consistently observed that genes with high expression fidelity for oligodendrocytes had higher expression fidelity for microglia (and vice versa) than they did for astrocytes or neurons. Because oligodendrocytes and microglia are more abundant in white matter than gray matter 46 , variation in the ratio of white matter to gray matter in CNS samples drives covariation in the abundance of these cell classes and the genes they express. False-negative associations can result from technical factors such as limitations in dynamic range/transcriptome coverage or probe failures, as well as biological factors like alternative splicing. Notwithstanding these limitations, the genes with the highest expression fidelity for major CNS cell classes are already remarkably stable. It is interesting to consider the ability of our approach to detect transcriptional signatures of less abundant cell classes (e.g. Figs. 4, S6 ). The ability to discern the transcriptional signature of a cell class in intact tissue samples depends on many factors, including its representation, the uniqueness and abundance of its transcripts, its stoichiometry with other cell classes, the technology platform, the algorithmic approach, and the sampling strategy 8 . Some of these factors can be optimized to improve sensitivity. Ultimately, we envision combining top-down and bottom-up strategies to fully deconstruct the transcriptional architecture of biological systems. Gene expression fidelity estimates were highly robust to the choice of gene set used for enrichment analysis, but more so for glia than neurons. This result indicates that neuronal diversity may require additional strategies to optimize estimates of neuronal expression fidelity, particularly on a regional basis. For example, the neuronal gene sets we used do not capture the transcriptional profile of cerebellar granule neurons, which is highly distinct 21, 29, 33 . To better account for neuronal diversity, future studies may combine neuron subtype-specific gene sets for enrichment analyses. Our results suggest that the functional identity of a cell class can be conceived as a vector of genes ranked by the fidelity with which they are expressed in that cell class relative to all other cells in the biological system of interest. An advantage of this framing is that it is inherently context-dependent. Beyond revealing novel biomarkers and cellular phenotypes, such definitions can provide 'molecular rulers' for measuring the validity of human cells derived in vitro for disease modeling/cell-replacement therapies. Furthermore, these definitions can be tested in de novo CNS transcriptomes for their ability to predict gene expression through mathematical modeling. Multivariate analyses of CNS transcriptomes often use module detection/clustering methods or projection methods such as principal component analysis. Although these methods have produced many important insights, they are inherently descriptive and do not facilitate comparisons among independent datasets. Because the building block of any biological system is the cell, and cells are distinguished by the genes they express, an alternative approach is to model gene expression as a function of cellular composition. We have shown how expression patterns of high-fidelity genes can be used for this purpose. The resulting models are highly robust, grounded in biology, easily compared among independent datasets, and capable of extracting cell-class-specific insights from intact tissue samples. Using this approach, we explored how predictive models of gene expression in transcriptomes from intact CNS samples can inform studies of aging, disease genes, pathological samples, regional heterogeneity, and species differences (Supplementary Note). Our study is based on a simple idea: variation in cellular composition among intact tissue samples will drive covariation of transcripts that are uniquely or predominantly expressed in specific kinds of cells. Although we have focused here on gene expression, our approach can also be applied to other types of molecular data, thereby offering a generalizable strategy for determining the core molecular features of cellular identity in intact biological systems. ONLINE METHODS Integrative analysis of human CNS transcriptomes We obtained publicly available gene expression data from eight studies 21, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] and one resource (http://www.brainspan.org/) that profiled large numbers of postmortem CNS bulk tissue samples from neurotypical humans. Expression profiling was performed on six technology platforms, including RNA-seq and various commercial microarrays. Samples from each of the nine sources were separated into 62 datasets representing 19 major neuroanatomical regions. Each regional dataset consisted of at least 25 samples, all of which came from adults (≥ 18 years). After removing outliers (see below), we analyzed a total of 7221 transcriptomes (Table S1 ). 1.1 Data preprocessing and quality control-Preprocessing was performed from raw data when possible. Affymetrix microarray raw data (.CEL files) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) using the following accession IDs: GSE11882 28 , GSE25219 29 , GSE3790 27 , GSE45642 31 , and GSE46706 32 . Probe-level data from Affymetrix Exon 1.0 microarrays (GSE25219 and GSE46706) were summarized using the Robust Multi-Array (RMA) algorithm 50 at the gene level with Affymetrix Power Tools software (APT 1.15.2) and reverse log-transformed for further processing. Affymetrix U133A and U133Plus2 microarray probes from GSE3790, GSE45642, and GSE11882 were pruned to eliminate non-specific and mis-targeted probes using the ProbeFilter R package (Dai et al. 2005) with mask files obtained from http:// masker.nci.nih.gov/ev/ 51 . After applying the mask files, only probe sets with at least seven remaining probes were retained for further analysis. Expression values were generated in R using the expresso function of the affy R package 52 with "mas" settings and no normalization, followed by scaling of arrays to the same average intensity (200). For GSE45642, gene expression was not scaled and technical replicates were removed (AMY samples restricted to site I; DLPFC samples restricted to site D; HIP and NUAC samples restricted to site M). Non-normalized Illumina microarray data were obtained from GEO for GSE36192 30 . Normalized expression data from GTEx, BrainSpan, and the Allen Brain Institute (ABI) were downloaded from their respective websites (http://www.gtexportal.org/, V6 data release; http://www.brainspan.org/, Oct2013 data release; and http://human.brainmap.org/, March2013 data release). For the RNA-seq datasets (GTEx and BrainSpan), RPKM gene expression values were used. Sample information for datasets with GEO accession IDs was obtained using the GEOquery R package 53 with the exception of hybridization batch information, which was extracted from the header information of Affymetrix .CEL files when available. Each of the 62 regional datasets was individually processed using the SampleNetwork R function 54 , which is designed to identify and remove sample outliers, perform data normalization, and adjust for batch effects 55 . We defined sample outliers as those that were more than four standard deviations below the mean connectivity of all samples measured over all features (Z.K < -4). Iterative pruning was applied for each regional dataset to remove all samples with Z.K < -4 (Table S1 ). For non-normalized data (GSE11882, GSE3790, GSE4542, and GSE36192), quantile normalization 56 was then performed. If a batch effect was present (defined as a significant association between the 1 st principal component of the expression data and a technical batch covariate), batch correction was performed using the ComBat R function 55 , which is implemented in SampleNetwork. For GTEx data, we detected a large batch effect due to center site. We therefore restricted our analysis to samples acquired by centers 'B1, A1' or 'C1, A1'. Lastly, prior to coexpression analysis, probes / genes that had zero variance across all samples were removed. For GTEx, we further restricted our analysis to 27,540 transcripts that were detected (≥ 0.1 RPKM) in at least 200 CNS samples. Table S1 provides additional details on data preprocessing and quality control. 1.2 Unsupervised gene coexpression module detection-Gene expression datasets can exhibit different correlation structures due to biological and technical factors such as cellular heterogeneity and sample size. This variability makes it difficult to apply a single set of parameters for coexpression analysis across many independent datasets. To address this challenge, we analyzed gene coexpression relationships in each regional dataset in the R statistical computing environment (http://cran.us.r-project.org) using a four-step approach 57, 58 . First, pairwise biweight midcorrelations (bicor) were calculated for all possible pairs of probes / genes over all samples in each dataset using the bicor function in the WGCNA R package 25 . Bicor is a robust correlation metric that is less sensitive to outliers than Pearson correlation but often more powerful than Spearman correlation 59, 60 . Second, probes / genes were clustered using the flashClust 25 implementation of a hierarchical clustering procedure with complete linkage and 1 -bicor as a distance measure. Third, the resulting dendrogram was cut at a series of heights corresponding to the top 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, or 5% of pairwise correlations for the entire dataset. Moreover, for each of these thresholds, we modified the minimum module size to require 8, 10, 12, 15, or 20 members. This approach yielded 7 × 5 = 35 different gene coexpression networks for each regional dataset. Third, initial modules in each network were summarized by their module eigengenes, which is defined as the first principal component obtained by singular value decomposition of the coexpression module 24 . Fourth, highly similar modules were merged if the correlations of their module eigengenes exceeded an arbitrary threshold (0.85). This procedure was performed iteratively for each network such that the pair of modules with the highest correlation (> 0.85) was merged first, followed by recalculation of module eigengenes, followed by recalculation of all correlations, until no pairs of modules exceeded the threshold. The WGCNA measure of intramodular connectivity (k ME ) was then calculated for each probe / gene with respect to all modules by correlating its expression pattern across all samples with each module eigengene 16, 24 . Module enrichment analysis with cell-class-specific gene sets-To identify cell-class-specific gene coexpression modules in each regional dataset, we cross-referenced module composition with gene sets consisting of published markers of major cell classes. For astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, we used sets of genes that were expressed >10x higher in each cell class (purified from mouse forebrain) vs. the other two (Tables S4-6 from Cahoy et al. 22 ; n=184 astrocyte genes, 130 oligodendrocyte genes, 319 neuron genes). For microglia, we used a set of genes expressed significantly higher in purified mouse microglia vs. whole brain (Table S2 from Hickman et al. 23 ; n=99 genes). For mural and ependymal cells, we used gene sets from adult mouse forebrain single-cell RNA-seq data (Table S1 from Zeisel et al. 61 ; n=155 mural genes, 484 ependymal genes). For endothelial cells, we used a set of genes that was significantly associated with known endothelial markers across 32 human organs (Table S3 , tab 1, from Butler et al. 62 ; n=237 genes). For OPCs, we used a set of genes identified in developing human midbrain singlecell RNA-seq data (Table S1 from La Manno et al. 63 ; n=48 genes). For choroid plexus cells, we used a set of genes from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Table S1 from Lein et al. 38 ; n=101 genes). For Purkinje neurons, we used a set of genes identified from human cerebellar samples (Table S6 from Kuhn et al. 64 ; n=80 genes). For dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons, we created sets of genes based on the top 50 genes ranked by correlation to TH and CHAT in our human midbrain and striatum expression datasets, respectively. Modules were defined as all unique genes with positive k ME values that were significant after applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05 / (# probes or genes in the regional dataset × # of modules in the network)). If a probe / gene was significantly correlated with more than one module it was assigned to the module for which it had the highest k ME value. For each regional dataset, enrichment analysis was performed for all modules in all (n = 35) networks using a one-sided Fisher's exact test as implemented by the fisher.test R function. The module with the most significant enrichment for each cell-class gene set was identified in each regional dataset. Data integration and calculation of gene expression fidelity-Operationally, we define the transcriptional 'profile' of a cell class in a given dataset as a list of probes / genes ranked by descending k ME values for the most significant cell-class module. To create 'consensus' transcriptional profiles for each cell class, transcriptional profiles from individual datasets were combined using the following approach. First, datasets that did not contain a module that was significantly enriched with markers of a given cell class after applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05 / # modules) were excluded (Table S2 ). To reduce collinearity among endothelial, mural, choroid plexus, and ependymal cell-class signatures, we further pruned regional datasets in which a given cellclass module also showed significant enrichment for any other cell-class module. For dopaminergic neurons, fidelity calculations were restricted to midbrain datasets. Second, probe / gene identifiers from all datasets were mapped to a common identifier (HomoloGene ID data build 68). Third, k ME vectors for each cell-class module in microarray datasets (in which individual transcripts are often targeted by multiple probes) were collapsed to unique identifiers by retaining for each HomoloGene ID the probe with the highest k ME value. Because k ME values are correlation coefficients, they cannot be averaged directly over independent datasets of different sample sizes. Therefore, to aggregate cell-class-specific k ME values for a given HomoloGene ID across regional datasets, we used Fisher's method for combining correlation coefficients from independent datasets 65 . We implemented this method by initially transforming k ME values using the Fisher transformation: Z gdc = 1 2 ln 1 + k ME . gdc 1 -k ME . gdc (1) where g indexes the gene, d indexes the regional dataset, and c indexes the cell class. An average of the resulting z-scores (weighted by sample size) was then determined with the following equation: Z gc = ∑ d = 1 D z gdc n d -3 ∑ d = 1 D n d -3 (2) where n denotes the number of samples in dataset d. The sampling standard deviation of z gc is: SD Z gc = 1 ∑ d = 1 D n d -3 . (3) Dividing the 'average' z-scores by the sampling standard deviation yields the genome-wide statistics displayed in Fig. 2 , Fig. 4 , Fig. S6 and Fig. S11A-D , or gene expression fidelity: f idelity = Z gc = z gc SD z gc . (4) For interpretability, we also convert z -gc into an 'average' correlation coefficient by performing the reverse Fisher transformation: r gc = exp 2z gc -1 exp 2z gc -1 , (5) which is reported as 'Mean.r' along with expression fidelity for all genes with respect to all cell classes for humans (Table S3 ) and mice (Table S7 ). It is important to note that gene expression fidelity, as defined here, is robust to the choice of gene set used for enrichment analysis, as illustrated in Fig. S2 . Calculation of gene expression fidelity in distinct CNS regions-We calculated gene expression fidelity in individual CNS regions represented by at least three independent datasets (FCX, STR, HIP, DI, and MID), as described above. We only included regional datasets that contained a significant cell-class module, as defined above. Enrichment analysis of high-fidelity genes- ). 1.7 Visualization of core cell-class genes and their characteristics-The top 50 genes ranked by expression fidelity for each cell class were visualized with custom software using the ggplot2 package 70 in R (Fig. 3A -D, Fig. S11E-H ). Mean gene expression levels were calculated for all samples in each regional dataset, converted to percentile ranks, and averaged across datasets ('CNS expression'). Regional percentile ranks (used in the analysis presented in Fig. 7 ) were similarly calculated for all samples from a given CNS region using ABI, GSE46706, and GTEx datasets. PubMed citations were extracted for each gene symbol using the RISmed package in R on 10/27/2016. To obtain total citations with potential relevance to specific cell classes we queried '[gene symbol]' and 'cell class' (e.g. 'neuron'). Cellular localization data were extracted from the COMPARTMENTS resource 36 . Human protein-protein interaction (PPI) data were downloaded from the STRING database (file: 9606.protein.links.detailed.v10.txt) 37 . PPI links in Fig. 3 Single-cell (SC) / single-nucleus (SN) RNA-sequencing analysis We obtained publicly available SC and SN RNA-seq data from four studies of adult human and mouse brains 1, 4, 26, 34 . Count data and sample information were downloaded from GEO using the accession IDs provided in Table S1 . The SC dataset from Darmanis et al. 1 consisted of 332 cells isolated from temporal cortices of eight individuals undergoing surgery for epilepsy, while the SC dataset from Tasic et al. 26 consisted of 1375 'core' cells isolated from primary visual cortices of various transgenic mice (see Supplementary Data Table 3 from Tasic et al. 26 ). The SN dataset from Lake et al. consisted of 35289 nuclei from postmortem samples of cortex and cerebellum from six individuals, while the SN dataset from Habib et al. 4 (which was obtained from https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets) consisted of 14963 nuclei from postmortem samples of cortex and hippocampus from five individuals. In all cases, we used the authors' original classifications to categorize cells. Cell-class module eigengenes predict relative cellular abundance-To test the ability of cell-class module eigengenes to predict variation in cellular abundance, we analyzed gene coexpression relationships in synthetic mixtures of single-cell RNA-seq data from human 1 and mouse 26 brain. For the human data, counts were normalized by dividing the total number of reads for each gene by the total number of reads for the sample. Normalized data were then multiplied by one million to yield counts per million (CPM), added by 1, and log 10 -transformed. For the mouse data, RPKM was used. We created synthetic mixtures by summing single-cell expression data over all genes from randomly sampled combinations of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Each synthetic sample consisted of 16 or 22 total cells for the human and mouse data, respectively, which was based on the minimum number of unique cells that were available for any cell class (in both cases, microglia). We generated 100 synthetic samples and performed gene coexpression analysis and cell-class module detection as described above. We chose a sample size of n=100 for the synthetic tissue sample coexpression analysis to best match the sample sizes of our acquired human regional datasets. We repeated this process 10 times. For each iteration, estimates of relative cellular abundance were determined from cell-class module eigengenes (i.e. PC1 of the most significant cell-class modules). In principle, the ability of cell-class module eigengenes to estimate relative cellular abundance across conditions (e.g. control samples versus Alzheimer's disease samples) could be confounded by concordant changes in the expression levels of high-fidelity genes that are used to estimate cellular abundance. For example, given two conditions, if the expression levels of high-fidelity genes uniformly increase in one condition but not the other it could appear that the relative cellular abundance had changed when it had not. To estimate the fraction of high-fidelity genes that would need to concordantly change to confound estimates of cellular abundance, we performed a simulation study of synthetic samples. Specifically, we created a 'control' dataset and a 'condition' dataset, each consisting of 100 synthetic samples, by aggregating single-cell RNA-seq data from human brain 1 as described above. To construct module eigengenes, we identified the top 10 astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, microglia, and neuron genes via differential expression analysis (see below) that were also expressed in at least 50% of cells in their respective cell class. We systematically perturbed gene expression in the 'condition' dataset by increasing the expression of randomly selected sets of genes (i.e. by selecting 1 to 10 out of the top 10 genes to perturb) by 100-, 50-, 25-, 10-, 5-, or 2-fold for each cell class of interest. We then combined the synthetic condition data with the synthetic control data and calculated module eigengenes. We repeated this analysis a total of 10 times. We then compared these perturbed module eigengenes to the actual cellular abundance. As shown in Fig. S9 , these perturbations had little effect on cellclass composition estimates across a wide range of expression level changes as long as at least half of the genes used to calculate the eigengenes remain unaltered. Gene coexpression analysis predicts differential expression among CNS cell classes-To test the relationship between cell-class module membership (k ME ) and differential expression, we calculated differential expression statistics from SC RNA-seq data using Monocle v2.2.0 71 . Restricting our analysis to exactly the same cells that were used to construct each synthetic dataset (described above), we calculated genome-wide differential expression statistics for each cell class compared to all other cell classes. Because the Monocle output statistics do not indicate directionality (i.e. up-or down-regulation), we ordered genes based on p-value and fold-change. Therefore, genes with the highest differential expression percentile are the most significantly up-regulated in a given cell class, and vice versa. Figs. 1, S1 compare k ME values from synthetic cell-class modules with differential expression percentiles for the corresponding cell class (averages of 10 iterations). Comparing gene expression fidelity with adult human SN RNA-seq data -To examine the relationship between estimates of gene expression fidelity from intact tissue samples and estimates of differential expression among single cells, we calculated differential expression statistics from SN RNA-seq data for astrocytes, oligodendrocyte, microglia, and neurons, using the cell assignments provided by the authors of the original studies 4, 34 . We used count data as input and calculated the significance of differential expression using Monocle v2.2.0 71 , ordering genes based on p-value and fold-change, as described above. Datasets were merged using HGNC gene symbol identifiers. To compare discordant results between fidelity and SN RNA-seq with orthogonal data (Fig. 2N-Q ), we analyzed RNA-seq data for cell classes that were purified by immunopanning from human temporal lobe surgical resections 3 (FPKM data from GEO; see Table S1 ). For each cell class (astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and mature [i.e. not O4+] oligodendrocytes), we averaged the expression values across replicate samples. To calculate the 'proportion of transcripts' for a given gene and cell class (Fig. 2N-Q ), we divided the average expression value for that gene in a particular cell class by the sum of its average expression values for all cell classes. Modeling gene expression in the human CNS Modeling gene expression in the neurotypical CNS-To determine how much of the variation in human CNS transcriptomes can be explained by variation in the abundance of major cell classes, we performed multiple linear regression of gene expression (γ s ) in each regional dataset composed of s samples using the lm function in R: γ s = β o + ∑ c = 1 C β c a cs + ε s (6) where a cs represents the inferred abundance in sample s of cell class c (where c = astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, microglia, or neuron), β c is the regression coefficient for cell class c, β 0 is a constant, and a cs is the error term. a cs was estimated for each cell class using high-fidelity genes. Specifically, we calculated the 1 st principal component (PC1) of the expression matrix for the top x high-fidelity genes (where x = 10 unless otherwise stated) over all samples in each regional dataset. PC1 was obtained through singular value decomposition of the scaled expression data using the svd (nu=1, nv=1) function in R, which is identical to the module eigengene metric 24 . When obtained in this fashion, PC1 of high-fidelity genes is a good predictor that is robust even when x is small (Fig. 5B ). To standardize modeling across datasets, we restricted our analysis to regional human CNS datasets with at least 40 samples (n = 47, Table S1 ). We restricted modeling to datasets with 40 samples, to provide ~85% power to identify large effect sizes (f 2 > 0.4, P < .05) when testing the hypothesis that the proportion of gene expression variance explained by variation in the abundance of four cell types is zero. We performed gene expression modeling for ~9600 genes that mapped to HomoloGene IDs that were present in all 47 datasets. If multiple probes mapped to a given HomoloGene ID, we retained the probe with the highest mean expression in the subset expression data. For each dataset, we randomly selected 10 sets of 40 samples for gene expression modeling and averaged the adjusted r 2 values from the ~9600 gene expression models for the 10 random subsets. We report adjusted r 2 values because they facilitate comparisons of models with different numbers of parameters 72 . To avoid circularity in gene expression modeling, we redefined consensus cell-class signatures using a leave-one-out approach. Specifically, we calculated gene expression fidelity for each cell class as described below using 46 datasets, then used the resulting high-fidelity genes to infer cellular abundance and model gene expression in the 47 th dataset (as illustrated in Fig. 5A-C ). This procedure was performed iteratively for all 47 datasets. In all cases, genes that were used to infer cellular abundance were excluded from gene expression modeling. For example, if the top 10 high-fidelity genes were used to infer cellular abundance, those 10 genes were excluded from modeling to avoid circularity. Therefore, the total number of modeled genes depends on the total number of genes used to infer cellular abundance (i.e. 1, 10, or 50 genes, as illustrated in Fig. 5B ). To further demonstrate the robustness of gene expression modeling as a function of inferred cellular abundance, we replicated the results shown in Fig. 5B after redefining consensus cell-class signatures using a leave-X-out approach, where X corresponded to 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 90 percent of datasets, which were sampled at random (n = 10 iterations per value of X). Subsequent analysis and modeling was performed as described above. As shown in Fig. S7 , gene expression modeling results were nearly identical for all values of X. These findings highlight the robust nature of gene expression fidelity, the resulting estimates of variation in cellular abundance, and the ensuing predictions of gene expression levels as a function of cellular composition in intact tissue samples. Furthermore, we did not observe consistent collinearity of estimated cellular abundance across datasets with the exception of oligodendrocytes and microglia, which tended to exhibit moderate positive correlations (~0.4) due to the increased concentration of these cells in white matter versus gray matter 46 . However, this relationship did not preclude the identification of high-fidelity genes for each cell class. Modeling gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain samples- Publicly available gene expression data from AD and control (CTRL) samples from three additional datasets (GSE48350, GSE44770, and GSE36980) [40] [41] [42] were downloaded from GEO and preprocessed using the SampleNetwork R function 54 to identify sample outliers. We defined sample outliers as those that were more than three standard deviations below the mean connectivity of all samples measured over all features (Z.K < -3). Iterative pruning was applied until all samples with Z.K < -3 were removed. For GSE44770 gene expression data, which was acquired with a Rosetta Human 44k microarray platform, we focused our analysis on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples, which were found in the original publication to have more transcriptional changes associated with AD compared to visual cortex and cerebellum 41 . Starting with the raw CY5 probe intensity values, we performed imputation of missing values 73 , quantile normalization 56 , and batch correction 55 . We removed 20 sample outliers out of 230 PFC samples. Batch correction was performed using batch information provided in the original study. For GSE48350 gene expression data, which was acquired with an Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 microarray platform, normalization was performed using the RMA algorithm 50 with the justRMA function of the affy R package and reverse log-transformed for further processing. We removed 4 sample outliers out of 253 samples. Batch correction was performed 55 using the hybridization batch date extracted from the .CEL file header information. For GSE36980 gene expression data, which was acquired with an Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST microarray platform, normalization was performed using the RMA algorithm 50 with the justRMA function of the affy R package 52 and reverse log-transformed for further processing. Due to small sample size (n = 79 samples), we did not remove any sample outliers. To estimate relative cellular abundance in CTRL and AD samples (Fig. 6E , Fig. S8A, B ) we calculated module eigengenes (PC1 obtained by singular value decomposition) using microarray probes that matched our consensus top 10 high-fidelity genes for each cell class. When multiple probes matched a high-fidelity gene, we retained the probe with the highest correlation to other high-fidelity genes. Module eigengenes were calculated from the combined expression data of CTRL and AD samples, which were jointly normalized as described above. We performed gene expression modeling in these datasets for every probe using the top 10 high-fidelity genes for each cell class as described above. For transcripts of high-fidelity genes that were targeted by multiple microarray probes, we retained the probe with the highest adjusted r 2 value when modeled as a function of the inferred relative abundance of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Gene expression modeling was performed separately for CTRL and AD samples. We ensured that the number of samples and regions sampled were matched between AD and CTRL samples. For GSE44770, which contained more AD samples than CTRL samples, we took a random subset of AD samples to match the number of CTRL samples (95 out of 112). For GSE48350, we first subset the CTRL samples to donors ≥ 70 years old in order to match the ages of the AD and CTRL samples, which gave 71 CTRL and 79 AD samples. We subsequently took a random subset of the AD samples, attempting to match the region of the samples (16 out of 24 postcentral gyrus samples) which gave 14 CTRL and 15 AD entorhinal cortex samples, 20 CTRL and 19 AD hippocampus samples, 17 CTRL and 16 AD postcentral gyrus samples, and 20 CTRL and 21 AD superior frontal gyrus samples. For GSE36980, we first subset the CTRL samples to donors ≥ 75 years old in order to match the ages of the AD and CTRL samples, which gave 35 CTRL and 32 AD samples. We subsequently took a random subset of the CTRL samples, attempting to match the regions of the samples (10 out of 12 temporal cortex samples) which gave 15 CTRL and 15 AD frontal cortex samples, 7 CTRL and 7 AD hippocampus samples, and 10 CTRL and 10 AD temporal cortex samples. To identify genes that were differentially expressed between CTRL and AD after controlling for variation in cellular abundance, we calculated the differences in t-statistics for cell-class model coefficients in CTRL and AD datasets. We then randomly split each dataset (using the sample subsets above) into two equal-sized groups of samples (where each half included CTRL and AD samples) and performed gene expression modeling for each half (n = 1000 permutations). For each permutation, we calculated the differences in t-statistics for cellclass model coefficients of the two randomly separated groups, which produced a null distribution of t-statistic differences for each cell-class parameter and each gene. Using the null distributions for each gene, we calculated empirical p-values for the measured t-statistic differences between CTRL and AD gene models. Genes were considered differentially expressed in a given cell class between CTRL and AD if the resulting p-values were < 0.05 in each of the three independent datasets. We note that in principle, the interpretation of modeling results can be confounded by concordant changes in cellular abundance and the expression levels of high-fidelity genes that are used to estimate cellular abundance. Simulation studies suggest that such a scenario is unlikely to occur unless more than half of the genes used to calculate an eigengene are transcriptionally dysregulated (Fig. S9 ). In practice, this possibility can be mitigated by comparing estimates of cellular abundance derived from different groups of high-fidelity genes, or by including a sufficiently large number of high-fidelity genes (e.g. 50) such that up-or down-regulation of any individual gene (or several genes) is unlikely to have an effect on estimates of cellular abundance. Below we present example R code for resolving changes in cellular composition from changes in cell-class-specific transcriptional identity:  ctrl.tvalue=summary(lm(as.numeric(ctrl)~ME.ctrl))$coef [2,3]   cond.tvalue=summary(lm(as.numeric(cond)~ME.cond))$coef [2,3]   #To determine the significance of the t-value difference between condition and control, #one can perform a permutation analysis of randomly sampled 'control' and 'condition' datasets, #using example code above, to calculate an empirical p-value. 3.3 Modeling gene expression to identify regional differences in transcriptional identities of major cell classes-To explore the regional heterogeneity of gene expression in major CNS cell classes, we adopted a conservative strategy to identify genes with binary expression patterns (i.e. ON in a given cell class in one region but OFF in the same cell class in another region). To reduce technical confounds, we restricted our analysis to pairwise comparisons of five brain regions (DI, FCX, HIP, MID, and STR) that were transcriptionally profiled in three independent studies (GTEx, GSE46707, and ABI). For each of these regional datasets (n = 15), we performed gene expression modeling as described above for all genes and samples using the top 10 highfidelity genes to infer the relative abundance of each cell class. A gene was considered to be 'regionally expressed' in a specific cell class if it met the following criteria: i) it was significantly associated with the cell class in region 1 (p < 2.67×10 -8 , corresponding to a Bonferroni corrected p-value for the cell-class model coefficient based on the total number of gene models: 0.05/([4 cell classes]×[5 regions] × [48,170 ABI probes + 17,868 GSE46706 genes + 27,526 GTEx genes])); ii) it was not significantly associated with the same cell class in region 2; iii) it was differentially expressed between region 1 and region 2 (i.e. the mean expression percentile rank was >20 percentile ranks higher in region 1 vs. region 2; and iv) the preceding criteria were replicated in all three studies. Analysis of CNS transcriptomes from non-human species We obtained publicly available gene expression data from intact tissue samples of mouse, rhesus macaque, and chimpanzee brains (Table S1 ). Data preprocessing is described below. Mouse brain expression data preprocessing, integration, and modeling- Mouse gene expression data were obtained from 22 studies 17, 22, 47, 66, [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] and one resource (http://www.genenetwork.org). Preprocessing was performed from raw data when possible. Affymetrix microarray raw data (.CEL files) were downloaded from GEO using the accession IDs provided in Table S1 . We only processed wild-type samples from studies with multiple conditions. Expression values for Affymetrix 430A, 430 2.0, and 430A 2.0 microarray probes were generated in R using the expresso function of the affy R package 52 with "mas" settings and no normalization. Probe-level data from Affymetrix Exon 1.0 and Gene 1.1 microarrays were summarized using the Robust Multi-Array (RMA) algorithm 50 at the gene level with Affymetrix Power Tools software (APT 1.15.2) and reverse logtransformed for further processing. Non-normalized Illumina microarray data were obtained from GEO. For RNA-seq datasets, FPKM gene expression values (Ms.Barres, Ms.Fertuzinhos, Ms.GSE63078) or count data (Ms.GSE60312, Ms.GSE62669) were downloaded from GEO or the study's website (Table S1 ). We normalized raw count data from Ms.GSE60312 by dividing the total number of counts for each gene by the total number of counts for the sample. Sample information for datasets with GEO accession IDs was obtained using the R package GEOquery 53 with the exception of hybridization batch information, which was extracted from the header information of Affymetrix .CEL files when available. Each of the mouse datasets was individually processed using the SampleNetwork R function 54 , which is designed to identify and remove sample outliers, perform data normalization, and adjust for batch effects 55 . We defined sample outliers as those that were more than four standard deviations below the mean connectivity of all samples measured over all features (Z.K < -4). Iterative pruning was applied to remove all samples with Z.K < -4. For non-normalized Affymetrix 430A, 430 2.0, 430A 2.0, and Illumina microarray data, quantile normalization 56 was then performed. If a batch effect was present (defined as a significant association between the 1 st principal component of the expression data and a technical batch covariate), batch correction was performed using the ComBat R function 55 , which is implemented in SampleNetwork. See Table S1 for the number of sample outliers removed and datasets that were batch corrected. Mouse coexpression analysis, enrichment analysis to identify cell-class modules, and data integration to determine consensus gene expression fidelity for major cell classes was performed as described for human data, with one exception. Due to heterogeneity introduced by variable sample preparation methods for mouse datasets (Table S1 ), we iteratively pruned outlier datasets before consensus fidelity calculations. Specifically, for each cell class we performed hierarchical clustering of genome-wide k ME values for all datasets using 1 -Pearson correlation as the distance measure with average linkage. Datasets with distance > 0.9 were iteratively pruned. Datasets included in the consensus fidelity calculation are indicated in Table S1 . Gene expression modeling was performed as described above using the top 10 genes from each mouse consensus expression fidelity cell-class list. Human vs. mouse comparison- We implemented a conservative strategy to identify cell-class-specific gene expression differences between humans and mice (i.e. ON in a given cell class in humans but OFF in the same cell class in mice, or vice versa). To identify genes expressed in human but not mouse cell classes, we started with the sets of genes represented by the Venn diagram in Fig. 6A (i.e. genes that were significantly associated with the same cell class in a majority of human regional datasets using a genomewide, Bonferroni-corrected p-value). We imposed three criteria to predict species differences: i) the gene was consistently well modeled with respect to the same cell class in humans (human median adjusted r 2 values ≥ 0.4); ii) the gene was not well modeled with respect to the same cell class in mice (mouse median adjusted r 2 values ≤ 0.05); iii) the gene was expressed substantially higher in humans vs. mice (mean expression percentile difference > 30). To identify genes expressed in mouse but not human cell classes, we started with mouse genes that were significantly associated with the same cell class in at least three independent datasets (using the same definition of 'significant association' that was used for humans). We imposed three criteria to predict species differences: i) the gene was well modeled with respect to the same cell class in mice (mouse median adjusted r 2 values ≥ 0.4); ii) the gene was not well modeled with respect to the same cell class in humans (human median adjusted r 2 values ≤ 0.05); iii) the gene was expressed substantially higher in mice vs. humans (mean expression percentile difference > 30). Primate brain expression data preprocessing and modeling-Affymetrix gene expression data from chimpanzee cerebral cortex were obtained from eight studies. Four studies analyzed samples using Affymetrix U95A/v2 microarrays [92] [93] [94] [95] and four studies analyzed samples using Affymetrix U133Plus2 microarrays [96] [97] [98] [99] . Because probes on these arrays were designed from human sequences, we created a custom mask file to exclude probes that did not have perfect alignment to the chimpanzee genome (panTro3: http:// hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/panTro3/bigZips/panTro3.fa.gz) and chimpanzee RefSeq mRNAs (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/panTro3/bigZips/ refMrna.fa.gz). After excluding all unknown, random, haplotype, and mitochondrial sequences, the chimpanzee genome was concatenated into a single file. This file, along with the RefSeq mRNA file, was formatted for BLAST from the command line using the formatdb function from the ncbi_tools package (installed via MacPorts). Using a local BLAST installation, we retained a probe if it aligned perfectly to both the chimpanzee genome (e-value = 2.0e-05) and chimpanzee RefSeq mRNAs (e-value = 2.0e-08). We also excluded probes that were identified as mis-targeted or non-specific with respect to human sequences (http://masker.nci.nih.gov/ev) based on a previous re-annotation study 51 . The resulting mask files (one for each microarray platform) were used with the ProbeFilter R package 100 to exclude probes without perfect and specific alignment to chimpanzee sequences. Expression data were generated from masked .CEL files using the expresso function from the affy package with 'mas' settings and no normalization, followed by scaling each sample to the same mean intensity (200). Only probe sets with at least half of their probes remaining after mask application were retained for further analysis (n = 9,178 [U95A/v2]; n = 35,754 [U133Plus2]). Further quality control and preprocessing was performed with the SampleNetwork R function 54 . Samples from each study were examined separately and no outliers were evident. After combining all samples for a given platform, data were quantile normalized 56 and batch-corrected for hybridization date using the ComBat R function 55 . The final, processed datasets consisted of 30 samples (U95A/v2) and 26 samples (U133Plus2) from chimpanzee cerebral cortex. RNA-seq RPKM gene expression data 45 from chimpanzee brain were downloaded from GEO (GSE49379). Further quality control and preprocessing was performed with the SampleNetwork R function 54 . No outliers were evident. Affymetrix Macaque genome array normalized expression data 20, 101 from ABI were downloaded from http://www.blueprintnhpatlas.org (2014-03-06 data release). Further quality control and preprocessing was performed with the SampleNetwork R function 54 . We defined sample outliers as those that were more than four standard deviations below the mean connectivity of all samples (Z.K < -4) measured over all features. Iterative pruning was applied to remove all samples with Z.K < -4. See Table S1 for the number of sample outliers removed. Due to the limited availability of gene expression data from non-human primate (NHP) brains, we did not attempt to calculate consensus gene expression fidelity statistics. Instead, we used a semi-supervised approach to identify top cell-class biomarkers for gene expression modeling in NHP brain samples. Parsimony and similarities between human and mouse gene expression fidelity suggest that there is likely to be strong conservation of highfidelity genes between human and NHP CNS cell classes. To determine the microarray probes that best matched our high-fidelity human genes in NHP expression data, we took a three-step approach: i) we identified NHP probes that targeted the top 50 high-fidelity genes for each human cell class; ii) we calculated the Pearson correlations among these probes over all NHP samples for each dataset; iii) we identified the top 10 probes with the highest average correlations to the others that mapped to unique gene symbols. These top 10 probes (genes) were summarized by PC1 through singular value decomposition of the scaled expression data using the svd (nu=1, nv=1) function in R and used for estimating the relative abundance of each NHP cell class in gene expression modeling. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis The ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/) suite 102 contains an extensive list of databases and was used to calculate enrichment p-values from hypergeometric tests corrected for multiple comparisons. Specifically, we used the ToppFun application with default parameters and report Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values. We present data from Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (biological process, cellular component and molecular function) and pathway annotations (Biosystems, BIOCYC, KEGG, and REACTOME). For disease annotations (Fig. 6B ), we used the Phenopedia database 39 , which is a curated collection of records retrieved weekly from an automatic literature screening program 103 of PubMed abstracts for gene-disease associations. Staff at NCBI manually select abstracts that meet inclusion criteria. We analyzed enrichment of our human cell-class genes (Fig. 6A ) with disease annotations consisting of ≥ 10 genes using a one-sided Fisher's exact test as implemented in the fisher.test R function. These p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling for the false-discovery rate, as implemented by the R package qvalue 49 . Hierarchical clustering of the log-transformed p-values was performed using Pearson's correlation as the similarity metric and average linkage. Phenopedia data were accessed on 12.14.15. Immunohistochemistry Human brain tissue was collected during autopsy with postmortem interval < 48 hours. Tissue was collected with previous patient consent in strict observance of legal and institutional ethical regulations in accordance with the University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research. Brains were cut into ~1.5 cm coronal or sagittal blocks, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days, cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek). Samples contained no evidence of brain disease as assessed by a neuropathologist (Eric J. Huang). 14μm cryosections were collected on superfrost slides (VWR) using a Leica CM3050S cryostat. Cryosections were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval in 10mM sodium citrate (pH = 6) for 10 min and permeabilized and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum. Primary incubations were overnight at 4 °C. Washes (3 × 10min) and secondary incubations (1 hour) were performed at room temperature. We searched for high-fidelity genes in the Human Protein Atlas 104 and identified validated antibodies for PON2 (astrocytes), DBNDD2 (oligodendrocytes), APBB1IP (microglia), and CELF2 (neurons) (Fig. 3A-D ). Antibodies used included goat PON2 (R&D systems: AF4344, 1:200), mouse ALDH1L1 (Neuromab: 73-140, 1:200), rabbit DBNDD2 (Sigma: HPA043991, 1:200), rabbit APBB1IP (Sigma: HPA017009, 1:100), rabbit CELF2 (Sigma: HPA035813, 1:200), rat GFAP (Fisher: 13-0300, 1:500), mouse NogoA (11c7, gift from M. Schwab, Zurich, Switzerland, 1:5000), goat AIF1 (Abcam: ab5076, 1:500), chicken NeuN (Millipore: ABN91, 1:500), rabbit PMP2 (Proteintech: 12717-1-AP, 1:100), chicken V5 (Abcam: AB9113, 1:500), chicken RFP (Rockland: 600-901-379S, 1:1000), rabbit DsRed (Clontech: 632496, 1:500), and chicken GFP (Aves: GFP-1020, 1:500). Images were acquired on a Leica TCS SPE laser confocal microscope with detection settings normalized to a secondary-only control. For IHC data (Fig. 3E -H; Fig. S5 ), a 20× objective was used (1024×1024 pixels). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) Human brain tissue was acquired as described above. All mouse strains were maintained in the University of California San Francisco specific pathogen-free animal facility, and all animal protocols were approved by and in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Laboratory Animal Resource Center. Mouse brain tissue (postnatal day 30) was acquired from animals perfused with 4% PFA and post-fixed for 24 hours followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose and embedded in OCT. Cryosections were prepared in the same manner described above. Due to variability in RNA quality from human brain cases, we screened a number of samples for robust positive RNA signal using the RNAscope 2.0 HD brown assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA; catalog #: 310033) for PPIB, a positive control. A sample from occipital cortex of a 19 month-old case demonstrated positive signal and was subsequently used for RNAscope multiplex fluorescent imaging (catalog #: 320851) of candidate species differences in astrocyte expression (Fig. S12 C, D ), according to manufacturer's instructions. RNAscope probe information is provided below. Images were acquired on a Leica TCS SPE laser confocal microscope with detection settings normalized to a negative control probe (DapB, catalog: 310043). A 40x objective was used (1024×1024 pixels). Images shown in Figs. 7, S12 were processed using the spots function (with default parameters) in the imaging software program Imaris (Bitplane). PMP2 ectopic expression All mice were maintained in the University of California San Francisco specific pathogenfree animal facility, and all animal protocols were approved by and in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Laboratory Animal Resource Center. Swiss Webster mice were used in all viral experiments (Simonsen Laboratories, Gilroy, CA). For AAV-PMP2 ectopic expression, two females and two males were used in each group. For lentiviral-PMP2 ectopic expression, three females and one male were used in each group. Otherwise, male mice were used. Animals were randomly allocated into experimental groups. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments as costaining with PMP2 allowed the experimenter to deduce the experimental groups. To generate adeno-associated virus (AAV), we subcloned the human PMP2 transcript (NM_002677.4) into an AAV plasmid backbone containing a GFAP minimal promoter (gfaABC1D) and tdTomato reporter. The AAV backbone was obtained from Addgene (pZac2.1 gfaABC1D-tdTomato, catalog # 44332) and Cyagen performed the subcloning. PMP2 was subcloned upstream of tdTomato and separated by a t2A self-cleaving peptide allowing for bicistronic expression (Fig. 8G ). Control (gfaABC1d-tdTomato) and PMP2 (gfaABC1d-PMP2-t2A-tdTomato) AAV5 viruses were generated by the Penn Vector Core (1.03e14 and 2.096e13 genome copies per milliliter, respectively). To generate lentivirus, the human PMP2 transcript (NM_002677.4) was synthesized with a 3' t2A self-cleaving peptide by GenScript. This transcript was subcloned into a 3 rd generation lentivirus backbone that contained a GFAP minimal promoter (gfaABC1D), spaghetti monster (sm) V5-tag reporter 105 , and a Lck membrane-targeting domain. The plasmid was a generous gift from Amy Gleichman (Carmichael lab). PMP2 was subcloned upstream of smV5 and separated by a t2A self-cleaving peptide (Fig. S12F ). High-concentration lentivirus was created by the UCSF viral core (~10 8 colony-forming units per milliliter) for control (gfaABC1D-Lck-SmV5) and PMP2 (gfaABC1D-PMP2-t2A-Lck-SmV5) viruses. To infect mouse astrocytes in vivo, one μL of virus (for AAV experiments, the control vector was diluted 1:5 in PBS) was injected into the lateral ventricles of postnatal day 1 mice (coordinates from lambda: x = 0.8 mm lateral, y = 1.5 mm caudal, z = -1.6 mm from surface). Forty-two days after injection, mice were euthanized and perfused (as above) for histological analysis. Thick sections were created using a sliding microtome (Microm HM 450; 140 μm and 50 μm for the AAV and lentivirus experiments, respectively). After staining for V5 or tdTomato (see antibodies above), astrocytes were imaged with a confocal microscope (CSU-W1 spinning disk or Leica TCS SPE for AAV and lentivirus experiments, respectively) at 40x and ~0.3 μm step size. The maximum astrocyte diameter was defined as the greatest linear distance between two points in a 2-dimensional slice that crossed through the nucleus. Primary branches were counted manually through the z-stacked images. Website information Genome-wide estimates of expression fidelity for CNS cell classes are provided in Table S3 for humans and Table S7 for mice. To facilitate interactions with our findings, we have also created a website where users can search by CNS region, cell class, and gene to retrieve information about gene expression fidelity and associated measures (http:// oldhamlab.ctec.ucsf.edu/). Major CNS cell classes (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons) are currently supported. Statistics and data presentation All statistical analyses were performed in the R statistical computing environment (http:// cran.us.r-project.org). Fisher's exact test was used to assess the significance of gene set enrichment, and Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were used to assess the significance of median differences (for paired and unpaired data, respectively). For PMP2 experiments, the normality of the data was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test and unpaired one-sided Welch's t-tests were used to assess the significance of mean differences between the two groups. Linear regression was used to assess the predictive significance of cellular abundance with respect to gene expression patterns. The following assumptions were made: linear relationship between dependent and independent variables, normality of the variables, little multicollinearity between the independent variables, statistical independence of the residuals, and homoscedasticity (i.e. constant variance of the residuals). These assumptions were not formally tested for all models (i.e. all genes). However, scatter plots of select models (e.g. Figs. 6C, 6G, 7J, 8C, S8, S10, S12, and others not shown) suggest that these assumptions are valid. Violin plots outline the Gaussian kernel probability density and are trimmed to the range of the data. Edges of boxplots denote interquartile range (25th-75th percentile) with whiskers denoting 1.5 times the interquartile range and black line denoting the median value; notches denote 1.58 times the interquartile range divided by the square root of the number of samples. Reporting summary Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article. accurately predicted the results of differential expression analysis for each cell class (n=10 synthetic datasets; 'up' / 'down' denote up-and down-regulated genes for each cell class). C) 62 gene expression datasets consisting of 7221 non-pathological samples from 19 adult human CNS regions were acquired and preprocessed (Table S1 ). D) Unsupervised gene coexpression analysis was performed for each dataset to identify modules of genes with similar expression patterns. Published markers of astrocytes (A), oligodendrocytes (O), microglia (M), and neurons (N) were cross-referenced with all modules (one-sided Fisher's exact test; Table S2 ). E) For each dataset, the module that was most significantly enriched with markers of a given cell class was summarized by its 1 st principal component (PC1, or module eigengene). F) Cell-class module eigengenes were used to calculate the similarity between cellular abundance and genome-wide expression patterns (k ME ) over all samples in each dataset. G) Genome-wide k ME values for significant cell-class modules from all datasets were combined to yield a global measure of expression 'fidelity' for each gene with respect to each cell class. Schematic: A gene has high fidelity for a cell class if its expression is sensitive (it is consistently expressed by members of that cell class) and specific (it is not expressed by members of other cell classes).

J-M) Mean expression percentiles in intact human CNS samples (n=7221 biologically independent tissue samples, Fig. 1C and Table S3 ) for concordant and discordant genes (F-I). Statistical significance was assessed with a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

provided an effective basis for an agent to locate goals in complex, unfamiliar, and changeable environments -optimizing the primary objective of navigation through deep RL. The performance of agents endowed with grid-like representations surpassed that of an expert human and comparison agents, with the metric quantities necessary for vector-based navigation derived from grid-like units within the network. Further, grid-like representations enabled agents to conduct shortcut behaviours reminiscent of those performed by mammals. Our findings show that emergent grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean spatial metric and associated vector operations, providing a foundation for proficient navigation. As such, our results support neuro-scientific theories that see grid cells as critical for vector-based navigation 7, 10, 11 , demonstrating that the latter can be combined with pathbased strategies to support navigation in complex environments. The ability to self-localize in the environment and update one's position on the basis of selfmotion are core components of navigation 13 . We trained a deep neural network to path integrate within a square arena (2.2m×2.2m), using simulated trajectories modelled on those of foraging rodents (see Methods). The network was required to update its estimate of location and head direction based on translational and angular velocity signals, mirroring those available to the mammalian brain 12, 14, 15 (see Methods, Fig. 1a&b ). Velocity was provided as input to a recurrent network with a Long Short-Term Memory architecture (LSTM) which was trained using backpropagation through time (see Methods and Supplemental Discussion), allowing the network to dynamically combine current input signals with activity patterns reflecting past events (see Methods, Fig. 1a ). The LSTM projected to place and head direction units via a linear layer -units with activity defined as a simple linear function of their input (see Extended Data Figure 1 for architecture). Importantly, the linear layer was subject to regularization, in particular dropout 16 , such that 50% of the units were randomly silenced at each time step. The vector of activities in the place and head direction units, corresponding to the current position, was provided as a supervised training signal at each time step (see Methods and Extended Data Figure 1 ). This form of supervision follows evidence that in mammals, place and head direction representations exist in close anatomical proximity to entorhinal grid cells 12 and emerge in rodent pups prior to the appearance of mature grid cells 17, 18 . Equally, in adult rodents, entorhinal grid cells are known to project to the hippocampus 19 and appear to contribute to the neural activity of place cells 19 . As expected, the network was able to path integrate accurately in this setting involving foraging behavior (mean error after 15s trajectory, 16cm vs 91cm for an untrained network, effect size = 2.83; 95% CI [2.80, 2.86], Fig. 1b&c ). Strikingly, individual units within the linear layer of the network developed stable spatial activity profiles similar to neurons within the entorhinal network 6, 12 (Fig. 1d , Extended Data Figure 2 ). Specifically, 129 of the 512 linear layer units (25.2%) resembled grid cells, exhibiting significant hexagonal periodicity (gridness 20 ) versus a null distribution generated by a conservative fields shuffling procedure (see Methods). The scale of the grid-patterns, measured from the spatial autocorrelograms of the activity maps 20 , varied between units (range 28cm to 115cm, mean 66cm) and followed a multi-modal distribution, consistent with empirical results from rodent grid cells 21, 22 (Fig. 1e ). To assess these clusters we fit mixtures of Gaussians, finding the most parsimonious number by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The distribution was best fit by 3 Gaussians (means 47cm, 70cm, and shows activity over location (top), spatial autocorrelogram of the ratemap with gridness indicated (middle), polar plot show activity vs. head direction (bottom). e, Spatial scale of grid-like units (n = 129) is clustered. Distribution is more discrete 22 than chance (effect size = 2.98, 95% CI [0.97, 4.91]) and best fit by a mixture of 3 Gaussians (centres 0.47, 0.70 & 1.06m, ratio=1. 49 &   1.51). f, Directional tuning of the most strongly directional units (n = 52). Lines indicate length and orientation of resultant vector (see Methods), exhibiting a six-fold clustering reminiscent of conjunctive grid cells 24 . g, Distribution of gridness and directional tuning. Dashed lines indicate 95% confidence interval from null distributions (based on 500 data permutations), 14 (11%) grids exhibit directional modulation (see Methods). Similar results were seen in a circular environment (Extended Data Figure 3 ). To ascertain how robust these representations were, we retrained the network 100 times, in each instance finding similar proportions of grid-like units (mean 23% SD 2.8%, units with significant gridness scores) and other spatially modulated units (Extended Data Figure 3 ). Conversely, grid-like representations did not emerge in networks without regularization (e.g. dropout, see Methods; also see 25 , Extended Data Figure 4 ). Therefore, the use of regularization, including dropout which has been viewed to be a parallel of noise in neural systems 16 , was critical to the emergence of entorhinal-like representations. Notably, therefore, our results show that grid-like representations reminiscent of those found in the mammalian entorhinal cortex emerge in a generic network trained to path integrate, contrasting with previous approaches using pre-configured grid cells (e.g. 26 ; see Supplemental Discussion). Further our results are consistent with the view that grid cells represent an efficient and robust basis for a location code updated by self-motion cues [6] [7] [8] [9] . Next, we sought to test the hypothesis that the emergent representations provide an effective basis function for goal-directed navigation in complex, unfamiliar, and changeable environments, when trained through deep RL. Entorhinal grid cells have been proposed to provide a Euclidean spatial metric and thus support the calculation of goal-directed vectors, enabling animals to follow direct routes to a remembered goal, a process known as vector-based navigation 7, 10, 11 . Theoretically, the advantage of decomposing spatial location into a multi-scale periodic code, as provided by grid cells, is that the relative position of two points can be retrieved by examining the difference in the code at the level of each scale -combining the modulus remainders to return the true vector 7, 11 (Fig. 2a ). However, despite the obvious utility of such a framework, experimental evidence for the direct involvement of grid representations in goal-directed navigation is still lacking. To develop an agent with the potential for vector-based navigation, we incorporated the "grid network" described above, into a larger architecture that was trained using deep RL (Fig. 2d , Extended Data Figure 5 ). As before, the grid network was trained using supervised learning but, to better approximate the information available to navigating mammals, it now received velocity signals perturbed with random noise as well as visual input. Experimental evidence suggests that place cell input to grid cells corrects for drift and anchors grids to environmental cues 21 . To parallel this, visual input was processed by a "vision module" consisting of a convolutional network that produced place and head direction cell activity patterns which were provided as input to the grid network 5% of the time -akin to a moving animal making occasional, imperfect observations of salient environmental cues 27 (see Methods, Fig. 2b&c and Extended Data Figure 5 ). The output of the linear layer of the grid network, corresponding to the agent's current location, was provided as input to the "policy LSTM", a second recurrent network controlling both the agent's actions and outputting a value function. Additionally, whenever the agent reached the goal, the "goal grid code" -activity in the linear layer -was subsequently provided to the policy LSTM during navigation as an additional input. We first examined the navigational capacities of the agent in a simple setting inspired by the classic Morris water maze (Fig. 2b&c ; 2.5m×2.5m square arena; see Methods and Supplemental Results). Notably, the agent was still able to self localize accurately in this more challenging setting where ground truth information about location was not provided and velocity inputs were noisy (mean error after 15s trajectory, 12cm vs 88cm for an untrained network, effect size = 2.82; 95% CI [2.79, 2.84], Fig. 2e ). Further, the agent exhibited proficient goal-finding abilities, typically taking direct routes to the goal from arbitrary starting locations (Fig. 2h ). Performance exceeded that of a control place cell agent (Fig. 2f , Supplemental Results and Methods), chosen because place cells provide a robust representation of self-location but are not thought to provide a substrate for long range vector calculations 11 . We examined the units in the linear layer, again finding a heterogeneous population resembling those found in entorhinal cortex, including grid-like units (21.4%) as well as other spatial representations (Fig. 2g , Extended Data Figure 6 ) -paralleling the dependence of mammalian grid cells on self-motion information 15, 28 and spatial cues 6, 21 . Accuracy of self-location decoded from place cell units. f, Performance of grid cell agent and place cell agent (y-axis shows reward obtained within a single episode, 10 points per goal arrival, gray band displays the 68% confidence interval based on 5000 bootstrapped samples). g, As before the linear layer develops spatial representations similar to entorhinal cortex. Left to right, 2 grid cells, 1 border cell, and 1 head direction cell. h, On the first trial of an episode the agent explores to find the goal and subsequently navigates directly to it. i, After successful navigation, the policy LSTM was supplied with a "fake" goal grid-code, directing the agent to this location where no goal was present. j&k, Decoding of goal-directed metric codes (i.e. Euclidean distance and direction) from the policy LSTM of grid cell and place cell agents. The bootstrapped distribution (1000 samples) of correlation coefficients are each displayed with a violin plot overlaid on a Tukey boxplot. We next turn to our central claim, that grid cells endow agents with the ability to perform vector-based navigation, enabling downstream regions to calculate goal directed vectors by comparing current activity with that of a remembered goal 7, 10, 11 . In the agent, we expect these calculations to be performed by the policy LSTM, which receives the current activity pattern over the linear layer (termed "current grid code"; see Fig. 2d and Extended Data Figure 5 ) as well as that present the last time the agent reached the goal (termed "goal grid code"), using them to control movement. Hence we performed several manipulations, which yielded four lines of evidence in support of the vector-based navigation hypothesis (see Supplemental Results for details). First, to demonstrate that the goal grid code provided sufficient information to enable the agent to navigate to an arbitrary location, we substituted it with a "fake" goal grid code sampled randomly from a location in the environment (see Methods). The agent followed a direct path to the newly specified location, circling the absent goal (Fig. 2i ) -similar to rodents in probe trials of the Morris water maze (escape platform removed). Secondly, we demonstrated that withholding the goal grid code from the policy LSTM of the grid cell agent had a strikingly deleterious effect on performance (see Extended Data Fig. 6c ). Thirdly, we demonstrated that the policy LSTM of the grid cell agent contained representations of key components of vector-based navigation (Figure 2j&k ), and that both Euclidean distance (difference in r = 0.17; 95% CI [0.11, 0.24]) and allocentric goal direction (difference in r = 0.22; 95% CI [0.18, 0.26]) were represented more strongly than in the place cell agent. Notably, a neural representation of goal distance has recently been reported in mammalian hippocampus 29 . Finally, we provide evidence consistent with a prediction of the vector-based navigation hypothesis, namely that a targeted lesion (i.e. silencing) to the most gridlike units within the goal grid code should have a greater adverse effect on performance and the representation of vector-based metrics (e.g. Euclidean distance) than a sham lesion (i.e silencing of non-grid units; average score for 100 episodes: 126.1 vs. 152.5, respectively; effect size = 0.38, 95% CI [0.34, 0.42] see Supplemental Results). Having demonstrated the effectiveness of grid-like representations in optimizing one-shot goal learning in a simple square arena, we assessed the agent's performance in complex, procedurally-generated multi-room environments, termed "goal-driven" and "goal-doors" (see Methods). Notably, these environments are challenging for deep RL agents with external memory (see Extended Data Figure 7e ,f,h&i and Supplemental Results). Again, the grid-cell agent exhibited high levels of performance, was strikingly robust across a range of network hyperparameters (see Extended Data Figure 7a ,b&c), and reached the goal more frequently than either control agents or a human expert -a typical benchmark for the performance of deep RL agents in game playing scenarios 2 (Fig. 3e&f and see Supplemental Results). Further, when agents were tested, without retraining, in environments considerably larger than those seen previously, only the grid cell agent was able to generalise effectively (Fig. 3g&h and see Supplemental Results). Despite the complexity of the "goal-driven" environment, we could still decode the key metric codes from the grid agent policy LSTM with high accuracy during the initial period of navigation -with decoding accuracy substantially higher in the grid cell agent than both the place cell and deep RL control agents (Figure 3j&k and Supplemental Results, Extended Data Figures 8 and 9 for control agent architectures). Finally, a core feature of mammalian spatial behaviour is the ability to exploit novel shortcuts and traverse unvisited portions of space, a capacity thought to depend on vector-based navigation 9, 11 . Strikingly, the grid cell agent -but not comparison agents -robustly demonstrated these abilities in specifically designed neuroscience-inspired mazes, taking direct routes to the goal as soon as they became available (Fig. 4 , Extended Data Figure 10 and Supplemental Results). Conventional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques typically require an accurate and complete map to be built, with the nature and position of the goal externally defined 30 . In contrast, the deep reinforcement learning approach described in this work has the ability to learn complex control policies end-to-end from a sparse reward, taking direct routes involving shortcuts to goals in an automatic fashion -abilities that exceed previous deep RL approaches [3] [4] [5] , and that would have to be hand-coded in any SLAM system. Our work, in demonstrating that grid-like representations provide an effective basis for flexible navigation in complex novel environments, supports theoretical models of grid cells in vectorbased navigation previously lacking strong empirical support 7, 10, 11 . We also show that vector-based navigation can be effectively combined with a path-based barrier avoidance strategy to enable the exploitation of optimal routes in complex multi-compartment environments. In sum, we argue that grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean geometric framework -paralleling their proposed computational role in mammals as an early-developing Kantian-like spatial scaffold that serves to organize perceptual experience 17, 18 Methods Path integration: Supervised learning experiments. Simplified 2D environment. Simulated rat trajectories of duration T were generated in square and circular environments with walls of length L (diameter in the circular case). The simulated rat started at a uniformly sampled location and facing angle within the enclosure. A rat-like motion model 31 was used to obtain trajectories that uniformly covered the whole environment by avoiding walls (see Table 1 in supplementary methods for the model's parameters). Ground truth place cell distribution. Place cell activations, c ∈ [0, 1] N , for a given position x ∈ R 2 , were simulated by the posterior probability of each component of a mixture of twodimensional isotropic Gaussians, c i = e - x-µ (c) i 2 2 2 ( σ (c) ) 2 N j=1 e - x-µ (c) j 2 2 2 ( σ (c) ) 2 , (1) where µ (c) i ∈ R 2 , the place cell centres, are N two-dimensional vectors chosen uniformly at random before training, and σ (c) , the place cell scale, is a positive scalar fixed for each experiment. Ground truth head-direction cell distribution. Head-direction cell activations, h ∈ [0, 1] M , for a given facing angle ϕ were represented by the posterior probability of a each component of a mixture of Von Mises distributions with concentration parameter κ (h) , h i = e κ (h) cos ϕ-µ (h) i M j=1 e κ (h) cos ϕ-µ (h) j , (2) where the M head direction centres µ (h) i ∈ [-π, π], are chosen uniformly at random before training, and κ (h) the concentration parameter is a positive scalar fixed for each experiment. Supervised learning inputs. In the supervised setup the grid cell network receives, at each step t, the egocentric linear velocity v t ∈ R, and the sine and cosine of its angular velocity φt . Grid cell network architecture The grid cell network architecture (Extended Data Figure 1 ) consists of three layers: a recurrent layer, a linear layer, and an output layer. The single recurrent layer is an LSTM (long short-term memory 32 ) that projects to place and head direction units via the linear layer. The linear layer implements regularisation through dropout 16 . The recurrent LSTM layer consists of one cell of 128 hidden units, with no peephole connections. Input to the recurrent LSTM layer is the vector [v t , sin( φt ), cos( φt )]. The initial cell state and hidden state of the LSTM, l 0 and m 0 respectively, are initialised by computing a linear transformation of the ground truth place and head-direction cells at time 0: l 0 = W (cp) c 0 + W (cd) h 0 (3) m 0 = W (hp) c 0 + W (hd) h 0 (4) The parameters of these two linear transformations (W (cp) , W (cd) , W (hp) , and W (hd) ) were optimised during training. The output of the LSTM, m t is then used to produce predictions of the place cells y t and head direction cells z t by means of a linear decoder network. The linear decoder consists of three sets of weights and biases: first, weights and biases that map from the LSTM hidden state m t to the linear layer activations g t ∈ R 512 . The other two sets of weights map from the linear layer activations g t to the predicted head directions, z t , and predicted place cells, y t , respectively via softmax functions 33 . Dropout 16 with drop probability 0.5 was applied to each g t unit. Note that there is no intermediary non-linearity in the linear decoder. Supervised learning loss. The grid cell network is trained to predict the place and head-direction cell ensemble activations, c t and h t respectively, at each time step t. During training, the network was trained in a single environment where the place cell centres were constant throughout. The parameters of the grid cell network are trained by minimising the cross-entropy between the network place cell predictions, y, and the synthetic place-cells targets, c, and the cross-entropy between head-direction predictions, z, and their targets, h: L( y, z, c, h) = - N i=1 c i log(y i ) - M j=1 h j log(z j ), (5) Gradients of ( 5 ) with respect to the network parameters were calculated using backpropagation through time 34 , unrolling the network into blocks of 100 time steps. The network parameters were updated using stochastic-gradient descent (RMSProp 35 ), with weight decay 36 for the weights incident upon the bottleneck activations. Hyperparameter values used for training are listed in Table 1 . Gradient clipping In our simulations gradient clipping was used for parameters projecting from the dropout linear layer, g t , to the place and head-direction cell predictions y t and z t . Gradient clipping clips each element of the gradient vector to lie in a given interval [-g c , g c ]. Gradient clipping is an important tool for optimisation in deep and recurrent artificial neural networks where it helps to prevent exploding gradients 37 . Gradient clipping also introduces distortions into the weight updates which help to avoid local minima 38 . Navigation through Deep RL Environments and Task We assessed the performance of agents on three environments seen by the agent from a first-person perspective in the DeepMind Lab 39 platform. Custom Environment: Square Arena This comprised a 10×10 square arena -which correspond to 2.5×2.5 meters assuming an agent speed of 15 cm/s (Fig. 2b, c ). The arena contained a single, coloured, intra-arena cue whose position and colour changed each episode -as did the texture of the floor, the texture of the walls and the goal location. As in the goal-driven and goal-door environments described below, there were a set of distal cues (i.e. buildings) that paralleled the design of virtual reality environments used in human experiments 24 . These distal cues were rendered at infinity -so as to provide directional but not distance information -and their configuration was consistent across episodes. At the start of each episode the agent (described below) started in a random location and was required to explore in order to find an unmarked goal, paralleling the task of rodents in the classic Morris water maze. The agent always started in the central 6×6 grids (i.e. 1.5×1.5 meters) of the environment. Noise in the velocity input u t was applied throughout training and testing (i.e. Gaussian noise , with µ = 0 and σ = 0.01). The action space is discrete (six actions) but affords fine-grained motor control (i.e. the agent could rotate in small increments, accelerate forward/backward/sideways, or effect rotational acceleration while moving). DeepMind Lab Environments: Goal-Driven and Goal-Doors Goal-driven and Goal-Doors are complex, visually-rich multi-room environments (see Fig. 3a-d ). Mazes were formed within an 11×11 grid, corresponding to 2.7 × 2.7 meters, (see below for definition of larger 11×17 mazes). Mazes were procedurally generated at the beginning of each episode; thus, the layout, wall textures, landmarks (i.e. intra-maze cues on walls) and goal location were different for each episode but consistent within an episode. Distal cues, in the form of buildings rendered at infinity, were as described for the square arena (see above). The critical difference between goal-driven and goal-doors tasks is that the latter had the additional challenge of stochastic doors within the maze. Specifically, the state of the doors (i.e. open or closed) randomly changed during an episode each time the agent reached the goal. This meant that the optimal path to the goal from a given location changed during an episode -requiring the agent to recompute trajectories. In both tasks the agent starts at a random location within the maze and its task is to explore to find the goal. The goal in both levels was always represented by the same object (see Fig. 3c ). After getting to the goal the agent received a reward of 10 points after which it was teleported to a new random location within the maze. In both levels, episodes lasted a fixed duration of 5, 400 environment steps (90 seconds). Generalisation on larger environments. We tested the ability of agents trained on the standard environment (11×11) to generalise to larger environments (11×17, corresponding to 2.7 × 4.25 meters). The procedural generation and composition of these environments was done as with the standard environments. Each agent was trained in the 11×11 goal-driven maze for a total of 10 9 environment steps, and the best performing replica (i.e. highest asymptotic performance averaged over 100 episodes in 11×11) was selected for evaluation in the larger maze. Note that the weights of the agent were frozen during evaluation on the larger maze. Evaluation was over 100 episodes of fixed duration 12, 600 environment steps (210 seconds). Probe mazes to assess shortcut behaviour To test the agent's ability to follow novel, goaldirected routes, we created a series of environments inspired by mazes designed to test the shortcut abilities of rodents. The first maze is a linearised version of Tolman's sunburst maze (Fig. 4a ) used to determined if the agent was able to follow an accurate heading towards the goal when a path became available (see Supplementary Methods for details). In this maze, after reaching the goal, the agent was teleported to the original position with the same heading orientation. Here we tested agents trained in the "goal doors" environments. Specifically, the network weights were held frozen during testing and all the agents were tested for 100 episodes, each one lasting for a fixed duration of 5, 400 environment steps (90 seconds). The second environment, the double E-maze (Fig. 4d ), was designed to test the agent's ability to traverse an entirely novel portion of space (see Supplementary Methods for details). In this maze we had a training and a testing condition. During the former agents were trained as in the other mazes (e.g. goal-driven; training details given below), whereas at test time weights were frozen. The agent always started in the central room (e.g. see Fig. 4d ). The maze had stochastic doors Agent Architectures Architecture for the Grid Cell Agent. The agent architecture (see Extended Data Figure 5 ) was composed of a visual module, of the grid cell network (described above), and of an actor-critic learner 40 . The visual module was a neural network with input consisting of a three channel (RGB) 64 × 64 image φ ∈ [-1, 1] 3×84×84 . The image was processed by a convolutional neural network (see Supplementary Methods for the details of the convolutional neural network), which produced embeddings, e, which in turn were used as input to a fully connected linear layer trained in a supervised fashion to predict place and head-direction cell ensemble activations, c and h (as specified above), respectively. The predicted place and head direction cell activity patterns were provided as input to the grid network 5% of the time on average, akin to occasional imperfect observations made by behaving animals of salient environmental cues 27 . Specifically, the output of the convolutional network e is then passed through a masking layer which zeroed the units with a probability of 95%. The grid cell network of the agent was implemented as in the supervised learning set up except that the LSTM ("GRID LSTM") was not initialised based upon ground truth place cell activations but rather set to zero. The input to the grid cell network were the two translational velocities, u and v, as in DeepMind Lab it is possible to move in a direction different from the facing direction, and the sine and cosine of the angular velocity, φ, (these velocities are provided by DeepMind Lab) -and additionally the y and z output by the vision module. In contrast to the supervised learning case, here the grid cell network had to use y and z to learn how to reset its internal state each time it was teleported to an arbitrary location in the environment (e.g. after visit to goal). As in the supervised learning experiments described above, the configuration of place fields (i.e. location of place field centres in the 11×11 environments, "goal-driven" and "goaldoors", 10×10 square arena, and 13×13 double E) were constant throughout training (i.e. across episodes). For the actor-critic learner the input was a three channel (RGB) 64 × 64 image φ t ∈ [-1, 1] 3×84×84 , which was processed by a convolutional neural network followed by a fully connected layer (see Supplementary Methods for the details of the convolutional neural network). The output of the fully connected layer of the convolutional network e 1 t was then concatenated with the reward r t , the previous action a t-1 , the current "grid code", g t , goal "grid code", g * (i.e. linear layer activations observed last time the goal was reached) -or zeros if the goal had not yet been reached in the episode. Note we refer to these linear layer activations as "grid codes" for brevity, even though units in this layer comprise also units resembling head direction cells, and border cells (e.g. see Extended Figure 6a ). This concatenated input was provided to an LSTM with 256 units. The LSTM had 2 different outputs. The first output, the actor, is a linear layer with 6 units followed by a softmax activation function, that represents a categorical distribution over the agent's next action. The second output, the critic, is a single linear unit that estimates the value function. Note that we refer to this as the "policy LSTM" for brevity, even though it also outputs the value function. Comparison agents We compared the performance of the grid cell agent against two agents specifically because they use a different representational scheme for space (i.e. place cell agent, place cell prediction agent), and relate to theoretical models of goal-directed navigation from the neuroscience literature (e.g. 41, 42 . We also compared the grid cell agent against a baseline deep RL agent, Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) 40 . Place cell agent. The place cell agent architecture is shown in Extended Data Figure 8b . In contrast to the grid cell agent, the place cell agent used ground truth information: specifically, the ground-truth place, c t , and head-direction, h t , cell activations (as described above). These activity vectors were provided as input to the policy LSTM in an analogous way to the provision of grid codes in the grid cell agent. Specifically, the output of the fully connected layer of the convolutional network e t was concatenated with the reward r t , the previous action a t-1 , the ground-truth current place code, c t , and current head-direction code, h t -together with the ground truth goal place code, c * , and ground truth head direction code, h * , observed last time the goal was reached -or zeros if the goal had not yet been reached in the episode (see Extended Data Figure 8b ). The convolutional network had the same architecture described for the grid cell agent. Place cell prediction agent. The architecture of the place cell prediction agent (Extended Data Figure 9a ) is similar to the grid cell agent described above: the key difference is the nature of the input provided to the policy LSTM as described below. The place cell prediction agent had a grid cell network -with the same parameters as that of the grid cell agent. However, instead of using grid codes from the linear layer of the grid network g, as input for the policy LSTM (i.e. as in the grid cell agent), we used the predicted place cell population activity vector y and the predicted head direction population activity vector z (i.e. the activations present on the output place and head direction unit layers of the grid cell network at each timestep) (see Supplementary Methods). The critical difference between the place cell agent and the place cell prediction agent (see Extended Data Figure 8b and 9a respectively) is that the former used ground truth information (i.e. place and head direction cell activations for current location and goal location) -whereas the latter used the population activity produced across the output place and head direction cell layers (i.e. for current location and goal location) by the linear layer of the same grid network as utilised by the grid cell agent. A3C We implemented the asynchronous advantage actor-critic architecture described in 40 with convolutional network having the same architecture described for the grid cell agent (Extended Data Figure 8a ). Other Agents We also assessed the performance of two deep RL agents with external memory (Extended Data Figure 9b ), which served to establish the challenging nature of the multicompartment environments (goal-doors and goal-driven). First, we implemented a memory network agent ("NavMemNet") consisting of the FRMQN architecture 3 but instead of Q-learning we used the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm described below. Further, the input to memory was generated as an output from the LSTM controller (Extended Data Figure 9b ), rather than constituting embeddings from the convolutional network (i.e. as in 3 ). The convolutional network had the same architecture described for the grid cell agent and the memory was formed of 2 banks (keys and values), each one with 1350 slots. Second, we implemented a Differentiable Neural Computer ("DNC") agent which uses content-based retrieval and writes to the most recently used or least recently used memory slot. 43 ning algorithms We used the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm 40 , which implements a policy, π(a|s, θ), and an approximation to its value function, V (s, θ), using a neural network parameterised by θ. A3C adjusts the network parameters using n-step lookahead values, Rt = i=0...n-1 γ i r t+i + γ n V (s t+n , θ), to minimise: L A3C = L π + αL V + βL H , where L π = -E st∼π Rt , L V = E st∼π Rt -V (s t , θ) 2 , L H = -E st∼π [H(π(•|s t , θ))]. Where L H is a policy entropy regularisation term (see Supplementary Methods for details of the reinforcement learning approach). The grid cell network and the vision module were trained with the same loss reported for supervised learning: L( y, z, c, h) = -N i=1 c i log(y i ) -M j=1 h j log(z j ) Agent training details. We follow closely the approach of 40 . Each experiment used 32 actor-critic learner threads running on a single CPU machine. All threads applied updates to their gradients every 4 actions (i.e. action repeat of 4) using RMSProp with shared gradient statistics 40 . All the experiments were run for a total of 10 9 environment steps. In architectures where the grid cell network and the vision module were present we used a shared buffer 44, 45 where we stored the agents experiences at each time-step, e t = (φ t , u t , v t ), collected over many episodes. All the 32 actor-critic workers were updating the same shared buffer which had a total size of 20e6 slots. The vision module was trained with mini batches of size 32 frames ( φ) sampled randomly from the replay buffer. The grid cell network was trained with mini batches of size 10, randomly sample from the buffer, each one comprising a sequence of 100 consecutive observations, [ φ, u, v]. These mini batches were firstly forwarded through the vision module to get c, and h, which were then passed trough a masking layer which masked them to 0 with a probability of 95% (i.e. as described above in section on grid cell architecture). The output of this masking layer was then concatenate with u, v, sin φ, cos φ, which were then used as inputs to the grid network, as previously described (see Extended Data Figure 5 for details). Both networks were trained using one single thread, one to train the vision module and another to train the grid network (so in total we used 34 threads). Also, there was no gradient sharing between the actor-critic learners, the vision module and the grid network. The hyperparameters of the grid cell network were kept fixed across all the simulations and were derived from the best performing network in the supervised learning experiments. For the hyperparameter details of the vision module, the grid network and the actor-critic learner please refer to Table 2 . For each of the agents in this paper, 60 replicas were run with hyperparameters sampled from the same interval (see Table 2 ) and different initial random seeds. Details for lesion experiment To conduct a lesioning experiment in the agent we trained the grid cell agent with dropout applied on the goal grid code input g * . Specifically, every 100 training steps we generated a random mask to silence 20% of the units in the goal grid code ( g * ) -i.e. units were zeroed. This procedure was implemented to ensure that the policy LSTM would become robust through training to receiving a lesioned input (i.e. would not catastrophically fail), and still be able to perform the task. We then selected the agent with the best performance over 100 episodes, and we computed the grid score of all units found in g. The critical comparison to test the importance of grid-like units to vector-based navigation was as follows. In one condition we ran 100 testing episodes where we silenced the 25% units in g * with the highest grid scores. In the other condition, we ran 100 testing episodes with the same agent with 25% random units in g * silenced. In this second case we ensured head direction cells with a resultant vector length of more than 0.47 were not silenced, to preserve crucial head direction signals. We then compared the performance, and representation of metrics relating to vector-based navigation, of the agents under these two conditions. Details of experiment using "fake" goal grid code To demonstrate that the goal grid code provided sufficient information to enable the agent to navigate to an arbitrary location we took an agent trained in the square arena, we froze the weights and we ran it in the same square arena for 5, 400 steps. Critically, after the 6th time that the agent reach the goal, we sampled the grid code from a random point that the agent visited in the environment (called fake goal grid code). We then substituted the true goal grid code with this fake goal grid code, to show that this would be sufficient to direct the agent to a location where there was no actual goal. Agent Performance For evaluating agent performance during training (as in Fig. 2f , Fig. 3e, f ) we selected the 30 replicas (out of 60) which had the highest average cumulative reward across 100 episodes. Also we assessed the robustness of the architecture over different initial random seeds and the hyperparameters in Table 2 by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). To plot the AUC we ran 60 replicas with hyperparameters sampled from the same interval (see Table 2 ) and different initial random seeds (Extended Data Figure 7a-c ). Neuroscience-based analyses of network units Generation of activity maps Spatial (ratemaps) and directional activity maps were calculated for individual units as follows. Each point in the trajectory was assigned to a specific spatial and directional bin based on its location and direction of facing. Spatial bins were defined as a 32×32 square grid spanning each environment and directional bins as 20 equal width intervals. Then, for each unit, the mean activity over all the trajectories points assigned to that bin was found. These values were displayed and analysed further without additional smoothing. Inter-trial stability For each unit the reliability of spatial firing between baseline trials was assessed by calculating the spatial correlation between pairs of rate maps taken at 2 different logging steps in training (t = 2e5; t = 3e5). The total training time was 3e5 so the points were selected with enough time difference to minimise the chances of finding random correlations. The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient was calculated between equivalent bins in the two trials and unvisited bins were excluded from the measure. Quantification of spatial activity Where possible, we assessed the spatial modulation of units using measures adopted from the neuroscience literature. The hexagonal regularity and scale of grid-like patterns were quantified using the gridness score 18, 20 and grid scale 20 , measures derived from the spatial autocorellogram 20 of each unit's ratemap. Similarly, the degree of directional modulation exhibited by each unit was assessed using the length of the resultant vector 46 of the directional activity map. Finally, the propensity of units to fire along the boundaries of the environment was quantified with the border score 47 . The gridness and border scores exhibited by units in the linear layer were benchmarked against the 95th percentile of null distributions obtained using a permutation procedure (spatial field shuffle 48 ) applied to each unit's ratemap. This shuffling procedure aimed to preserve the local topography of fields within each ratemap while distributing the fields themselves at random 48 . The means, over units, of the thresholds obtained were gridness > 0.37 and border score > 0.50. Units exceeding these thresholds were considered to be grid-like and border-like, respectively. To identify directionally modulated cells we applied Rayleigh tests of directional uniformity to the binned directional activity maps. A unit was considered to be directionally modulated if the null hypothesis of uniform was rejected at the α = 0.01 level -corresponding to units with resultant vector length in excess of 0.47 (See Supplementary Methods for further details). Clustering of scale in grid-like units To determine if grid-like units exhibited a tendency to cluster around specific scales we applied two methods. First, following 22 , to determine if the scales of grid-like units (gridness > 0.37, 129/512 units) followed a continuous or discrete distribution we calculated the discreteness measure 22 of the distribution of their scales (see Supplementary Methods). The discreteness score of the real data was found to exceed that of all of the 500 shuffles. Second, to characterise the number and location of scale clusters, the distribution of scales from grid-like units was fit with Gaussian mixture distributions, 3 components were found to provide the most parsimonious fit, indicating the presence of 3 scale clusters. (See Supplementary Methods for further details.) Multivariate decoding of representation of metric quantities within LSTM To test whether the grid agent learns to use the predicted vector based navigation (VBN) metric codes, we recorded the activation from the hidden units of the the Policy LSTM layer while the agent navigated 200 hundred episodes in the land maze. We used L2-regularized (ridge) regression to decode Euclidean distance and allocentric direction to the goal (see Supplementary Methods for full decoding details). We specifically focussed on twelve steps (steps 9-21) during the early portion of navigation, but after the agent has had time to accurately self-localize. It is this early period after the agent has reached the goal for the first time where a VBN strategy should be most effective. We conducted the same analysis on the place cell agent control which is not predicted to use vector-based navigation as efficiently. The decoding accuracy was measured as the correlation between predicted and actual metric values in held-out data. Decoding accuracy was compared across different agents by assessing the difference in decoding correlations between the agents. A bootstrap method (using 10,000 samples) was used to computed a 95% confidence interval on this correlation difference, and these are reported for each comparison. The same approach was used to decode and compare these two metrics in the lesioned agents on the land maze. Finally, to explore VBN metrics in a more complex environment, the same method was applied to the goal-driven task. In this case we also investigated metric decoding in the control A3C agent. Data availability statement All reinforcement learning tasks described throughout the paper were built using the publicly available DeepMind Lab platform (https://github.com/deepmind/lab). We expect to release this set of tasks through this platform in the near future. BiorXiv (2017). There is Supplemental Information that contains additional results, discussion and details about the Methods. Extended data for Vector-based Navigation using Grid-like Representations in Artificial Agents. 605 Extended Data Figure 1 : Network architecture in the supervised learning experiment. The recurrent layer of the grid cell network is an LSTM with 128 hidden units. The recurrent layer receives as input the vector [v t , sin( φt ), cos( φt )]. The initial cell state and hidden state of the LSTM, l 0 and m 0 respectively, are initialised by computing a linear transformation of the ground truth place c 0 and head-direction h 0 activity at time 0. The output of the LSTM is followed by a linear layer on which dropout is applied. The output of the linear layer, g t , is linearly transformed and passed to two softmax functions that calculate the predicted head direction cell activity, z t , and place cell activity, y t , respectively. We found evidence of grid-like and head direction-like units in the linear layer activations g t . Extended Data Figure 3 This separation was imposed to minimise the effect of temporal correlations and to provide a conservative test of stability. Grid-like units (gridness > 0.37) blue, directionally modulated units (resultant vector length > 0.47) green. Grid-like units exhibit high spatial stability, while directionally modulated units do not. c) Robustness of the grid representation to starting conditions. The network was retrained 100 times with the same hyperparamters but different random seeds controling the initialisation of network weights, c and h. Populations of grid-like units (gridness > 0.37) were found to appear in all cases, the average proportion of grid-like units being 23% (SD of 2.8%). In this case the supervised learner does not receive the ground truth c 0 and h 0 to signal its initial position, but uses input from the visual module to self-localize after placement at a random position within the environment. Visual module: since experimental evidence suggests that place cell input to grid cells functions to correct for drift and anchor grids to environmental cues 21, 27 , visual input was processed by a convolutional network to produce place cell (and head direction cell) activity patterns which were used as input to the grid network. The output of the vision module was only provided 5% of the time to the grid network; see Methods for implementational details), akin to occasional observations made by behaving animals of salient environmental cues 27 . The output of the vision module was concatenated with u, v, sin φ, cos φ to form the input to the GRID LSTM, which is the same network as in the supervised case (see Methods and Extended Data Figure 1 ). The actor critic learner (light blue dashed) receives as input the concatenation of e 1 t produced by a convolutional network with the reward r t , the previous action a t -1 , the linear layer activations of the grid cell network g t ("current grid-code"), and the linear layer activations observed last time the goal was reached, g * . g * ("goal grid-code"), which is set to zeros if the goal has not been reached in the episode. The fully connected layer was followed by an LSTM with 256 units. The LSTM has 2 different outputs. The first output, the actor, is a linear layer with 6 units followed by a softmax activation function, that represents a categorical distribution over the agent's next action π t . The second output, the critic, is a single linear unit that estimates the value function v t . Extended Data Figure 8 : Architecture of the A3C and place cell agent. a) The A3C implementation is as described in 40 . b) The place cell agent was provided with the ground-truth place, c t , and head-direction, h t , cell activations (as described above) at each time step. The output of the fully connected layer of the convolutional network e t was concatenated with the reward r t , the previous action a t -1, the ground-truth current place code, c t , and current head-direction code, h t -together with the ground truth goal place code, c * , and ground truth head direction code, h * , observed the last time the agent reached the goal (see Methods). Extended Data Figure 9 : Architecture of the place cell prediction agent and of the NavMem-Net agent. a) The architecture of the place cell prediction agent is similar to the grid cell agent -having a grid cell network with the same parameters as that of the grid cell agent. The key difference is the nature of the input provided to the policy LSTM. Instead of using grid codes from the linear layer of the grid network g, we used the predicted place cell population activity vector y and the predicted head direction population activity vector z (i.e. the activations present on the output place and head direction unit layers of the grid cell network, corresponding to the current and goal position) as input for the policy LSTM. As in the grid cell agent, the output of the fully connected layer of the convolutional network, e t , the reward r t , and the previous action a t -1, were also input to the policy LSTM. The convolutional network had the same architecture described for 1 -Supplementary Results for Vector-based Navigation using Grid-like Representations in Artificial Agents. 1a -Assessing path integration and goal-finding in a square arena To better understand the advantage conveyed by a grid-like representation, we trained the agent to navigate to an unmarked goal in a simple setting inspired by the classic Morris water maze (Fig. 2b&c ; 2.5m×2.5m square arena; see Methods). The agent was trained in episodes to ensure it was able to generalize to arbitrary open field enclosures, each episode consisted of 5, 400 steps -corresponding to approximately 90 s in total -after which the goal location, floor texture, and cue location were randomized. An episode started with the agent in a random location, requiring it to first explore in order to find an unmarked goal. Upon reaching the goal the agent was teleported to another random location and continued to navigate with the aim of maximising the number of times it reached the goal before the episode ended. In this setting self-localisation was more challenging. Previously, in experiment described above, information about the ground truth initial location was provided to initialise the LSTM, here the grid network learned to use visual information to determine the agent's starting location and to correct for drift resulting from noise introduced to the velocity inputs (see Methods). Despite these differences the grid network continued to self-localize accurately, outputting place cell predictions consistent with the agent's location (Fig. 2e ). After locating the goal for the first time during an episode, the agent typically returned directly to it from each new starting position, showing decreased latencies for subsequent visits (average score for 100 episodes: grid cell agent = 289 vs place cell agent = 238, effect size = 1.80, 95% CI [1.63, 1.99], Fig. 2h , Extended Data Figure 6d ). Performance of the grid cell agent was substantially focused on the initial portion of navigation after the agent had reached the goal and was teleported to a new location. We found that the policy LSTM of the grid cell agent contained representations of two key components of vector-based navigation (Euclidean distance, and allocentric goal direction), and that both were more strongly present than in the place cell agent (Euclidean distance difference in r = 0.17; 95% CI [0.11, 0.24]; Goal direction difference in r = 0.22; 95% CI [0.18, 0.26]; Figure 2j&k ). Notably, a neural representation of goal distance has recently been reported in mammalian hippocampus 29 (also see 49 ). To determine the behavioral relevance of these two metric codes, we examined the goal-homing accuracy in each episode over several steps immediately following the period of metric decoding. We found that variation in both Euclidean distance (r = 0.22, 95% CI [-0.32, -0.09]) and allocentric goal direction (r = 0.22, 95% CI [-0.38, -0.15]) decoding error correlated with subsequent behavioral accuracy. This suggests that stronger metric codes are indeed important for accurate goal-homing behavior. Finally, to determine the specific contribution of the grid-like units, we made targeted lesions to the goal grid code and reexamined performance and representation of the goal directed vector. When 25% of the most grid-like units were silenced (see Methods), performance was worse than lesioning 25% at random (average score for 100 episodes: 126.1 vs. 152.5, respectively; effect size = 0.38, 95% CI [0.34, 0.42]). Further, as expected, goal-directed vector codes were more strongly degraded (Euclidean distance: random lesions decoding accuracy r = 0.45, top-grid lesions decoding accuracy r = 0.38, difference in decoding accuracy = 0.08, 95% CI [0.03, 0.13]). We also performed an additional experiment where the effect of the targeted grid lesion was compared to that of lesioning non-grid units with patchy firing (see Supplemental Methods -section 3d for the details of the procedure). Our results show that the targeted grid cell lesion had a greater effect than the patchy non-grid cell lesion (average score for 100 episodes: 126.1 vs. 151.7, respectively; effect size = 0.38, 95% CI [0.34, 0.42]). These results support a role for the grid-like units in vector-based navigation, with the relatively mild impact on performance potentially accounted for by the difference in lesioning networks as compared to animals. Specifically, the procedure for lesioning networks differs in important respects from experimental lesions in animals -which bears upon the results observed. Briefly, networks have to be trained in the presence of an incomplete goal grid code and thus have the opportunity to develop a degree of robustness to the lesioning procedure -which would otherwise likely result in a catastrophic performance drop (see Methods). This opportunity is not typically afforded to experimental animals. This, therefore, may explain the significant but relatively small performance deficit observed in lesioned networks. 1c -Comparison of grid cell agent with other agents in challenging, procedurally-generated multi-room environments Our comparison agents for the grid cell agent included an agent specifically designed to use a different representational scheme for space (i.e. place cell agent, see Extended Data Figure 8b and see Methods), and a baseline deep RL agent (A3C 40 , see Extended Data Figure 8a ). . A key difference between grid and place cell based models is that the former are proposed to enable the computation of goal-directed vectors across large-scale spaces 7, 10, 11 and 50 , whereas place cell based models are inherently limited in terms of navigational range (i.e. to the largest place field) and do not support route planning across unexplored spaces 11 . First, we test these three agents in the "goal-driven" maze (see Methods). The grid-cell agent ex-hibited high levels of performance, and over the course of 100 episodes, attained an average score of 346. https://youtu.be/BWqZwLQfwlM). Interestingly, therefore, the enhanced performance of the grid cell agent was particularly evident when it was necessary to recompute trajectories due to changes in the door configuration, highlighting the flexibility of vector-based navigation in exploiting ad hoc short-cuts (Fig. 3f ). The grid cell agent exhibited stronger performance than a professional human player in both "goaldriven" (average score: grid cell agent = 346.50 vs. professional human player = 261, effect size = 4.00, 95% CI [3.50, 4.52]) and "goal-doors" (average score: grid cell agent = 284.30 vs. professional human player = 240.5, effect size = 2.49, 95% CI [2.18, 2.81]). The human expert received 10 episodes worth of training in each environment before undergoing 20 episodes of testing. This is considerably less training than that experienced by the network. Importantly, however, the mammalian brain has evolved to path integrate and naturally the human expert had a lifetimes worth of relevant navigational experience. Hence, although directly drawing concrete conclusions from relative performance of human and agents is necessarily difficult, providing human-level performance is useful as a broad comparison and represents a commonly used benchmark in similar papers 44 . We also tested the ability of agents trained on the standard environment (11 × 11)  We assessed the performance of two deep RL agents with external memory 3 , 43 (see Extended Data Figure 9b ). Whilst these agents were trained purely using RL -that is, they did not utilize supervised learning implemented by the grid cell agent -their relatively poor performance illustrates the challenge posed by the environments used (i.e. goal-driven and goal-doors) and shows that is not readily solved by the use of external memory alone. Importantly, this also serves to highlight the substantial advantage afforded to agents that can exploit vector-based mechanisms grounded in a grid-cell based Euclidean framework of space -and the potential for future work to examine the combination of such navigational strategies with more memory-intensive approaches. We also compare the grid cell agent with a variation of the place cell agent which used the predicted place cell and head direction cell as input to the Policy LSTM instead of the ground truth information (see Extended Data Figure 9a and Supplementary Methods). This agent exhibited substantially poorer performance than the grid agent. Further, decoding accuracy was substantially and significantly higher in the grid cell agent than 1d -Probe mazes assessing ability to take novel shortcuts A core feature of mammalian spatial behaviour is the ability to exploit novel shortcuts and traverse unvisited portions of space 9 , a capacity thought to depend on vector-based navigation 9, 11 . To assess this, we examined the ability of the grid cell agent and comparison agents to use novel shortcuts when they became available in specifically configured probe mazes (see Methods for details). First, agents trained in the goal-doors environment were exposed to a linearized version of Tolman's sunburst maze. The grid cell agent, but not comparison agents, was reliably able to exploit shortcuts, preferentially passing through the doorways that offered a direct route towards the goal (Fig. 4a-c , and Extended Data Figure 10 ). The average testing score of the grid cell agent was higher than that of the place agent (124.1 vs 60.9, effect size = 1. Next, to test the agents' abilities to traverse a previously unvisited section of an environment, we employed the "double-E shortcut" maze (Fig. 4d -f, and Extended Data Figure 10e-l ). During training, the corridor presenting the shortest route to the goal was closed at both ends, preventing access or observation of the interior. In this simple configuration the grid and place cell agents performed similarly, exceeding the RL control agent (Extended Data Figure 10i ). However, at test, when the doors were opened, the grid cell agent was able to exploit the short-cut corridor, whereas the control agents continued to follow the longer route they had previously learnt (Extended Data Figure 10j-l ). In the "double-E shortcut" maze performance does not significantly differ between the grid and place cell agents, but both are significantly better than the A3C control (grid cell agent vs. place cell agent, effect size = 0. 2a -Backpropagation through time (BPTT) Whilst backpropagation provides a powerful mechanism for adjusting the weights within hierarchical networks analogous to those found in the brain (e.g. the ventral visual stream), it has long been thought to be biologically implausible for several reasons: for example, it requires access to information that is non-local to a synapse (i.e. information about errors many layers downstream). However, recent research in several directions have provided fresh new insights into how a process akin to backpropagation may be implemented in the brain 51 . Whilst less research has been conducted into how BPTT could be implemented in the brain, recent work points to potentially promising avenues that deserve further exploration 52 . 2b -Relationship to previous models of grid cells Our work contrasts with previous approaches where grid cells have been hard-wired [53] [54] [55] [56] and 57 , derived through eigendecomposition of place fields 58, 59 , or arisen through self organization in the absence of an objective function 60 . It is worth noting that our experiments were not designed to provide insights into the development of grid cells in the brain -due to the limitations of the training algorithm used (i.e. backpropagation) in terms of biological plausibiliy (although see 61 ). More generally, however, our findings accord with the perspective that the internal representations of individual brain regions such as the entorhinal cortex arise as a consequence of optimizing for specific ethologically important objective functions (e.g. path integration) -providing a parallel to the optimization process in neural networks 62 . 3 -Supplementary Methods for Vector-based Navigation using Grid-like Representations in Artificial Agents. 3a -Navigation through Deep RL Probe mazes to test for shortcut behavior The first maze used to test shortcut behaviour was a linearized version of Tolman's sunburst maze 63 (Fig. 4a ). The maze was used to determined if the agent was able to follow an accurate heading towards the goal when a path became available. The door was open (door 5, Fig. 4a ), but after that all the doors were opened for the remainder of the episode. After reaching the goal, the agent was teleported to the original position with the same heading orientation. This maze was used to test the shortcut capabilities of agents that had been previously trained in the "goal doors" environment. All the agents were tested in the maze for 100 episodes, each one lasting for a fixed duration of 5, 400 environment steps (90 seconds). The second maze, termed double E-maze, was designed to test the agents abilities to traverse a previously unvisited section of an environment. The maze was size 12×13 and was formed of 2 symmetric sides each one with 3 corridors. The goal location was always on the bottom right or left, and the location was randomized over episodes. During training, the left and right corridors closest to the bottom (i.e. those providing the shortest paths to the goals) were always closed from both sides to avoid any exploration down these corridors (see Extended Data Figure 10e&f ). This ensured any subsequent shortcut behavior had to traverse unexplored space. Of the remaining corridors, at any time, on each side only one was accessible (top or middle, randomly determined). Each time the agent reached the goal, the doors were randomly configured again (with the same constraints). The agent always started in a random location in the central room with a random orientation. At test time, after the agent reached the goal for the first time, all corridors were opened, allowing potential shortcut behavior (see Extended Data Figure 10g&h ). During the test phase, the agent always started in the center of the central room facing north. Each agent was trained for 1e9 environment step divided into episodes of 5, 400 steps (90 seconds), and subsequently tested for 100 episodes, each one lasting for a fixed duration of 5, 400 environment steps (90 seconds). 3b -Additional information about Agent Architectures Details of vision module in the grid cell agent The convolutional neural network had four convolutional layers. The first convolutional layer had 16 filters of size 5 × 5 with stride 2 and padding 2. The second convolutional layer had 32 filters of size 5 × 5 with stride 2 and padding 2. The third convolutional layer had 64 filters of size 5 × 5 with stride 2 and padding 2. Finally, the fourth convolutional layer with 128 filters of size 5 × 5 with stride 2 and padding 2. All convolutional hidden layers were followed by a rectifier nonlinearity. The last convolution was followed by a fully connected layer with 256 hidden units. The same convolutional neural network was used for the actor-critic learner. The weights of the two network were not shared. Further details about the place cell agent Place cell agent with homogeneously sized place fields: we tested agents with fields -modelled as regular 2D Gaussians -having standard deviations of 7.5cm, 25cm, and 75cm bins. The agent with fields of size 7.5cm was found to perform best (highest cumulative reward on the Morris water maze task; see Supplemental Results) and hence was chosen as the primary place cell control agent (see main text for score comparisons). Place cell agent with heterogeneously sized place fields: to control for differences in the number and area of spatial fields between agents, we also generated two further place cell agents that were explicitly matched to the grid cell agent. Specifically, we used a watershedding algorithm 64 to detect 660 individual grid fields in the grid-like units of the grid cell agent. The distribution of the areas of these fields were found to exhibit 3 peaks -based on a Gaussian fitting procedure -having means equivalent to 2D Gaussians with standard deviations of 8.2cm, 15.0cm, and 21.7cm. Hence we generated a further control agent having 395 place cells of size 8.2cm, 198 of size 15.0cm, and 67 of 21.7cm -660 place cells in total, the relative numbers reflecting the magnitudes of the Gaussians fit to the distribution. A final control agent was also generated having 256 place cell units in total -the same number of linear layer units as the grid agent -distributed across the same three scales in a similar ratio. Additionally, we note that from a machine learning perspective, the place cell and grid cell agents with the same number of linear layer units are in principle well matched since they are provided with the same input information and have an identical number of parameters. Place cell prediction agent. The architecture of the place cell prediction agent (Extended Data Figure 9a ) is similar to the grid cell agent described in the Methods : the key difference is the nature of the input provided to the policy LSTM as described below. Specifically, the output of the fully connected layer of the convolutional network, e t , was concatenated with the reward r t , the previous action a t -1, the current predicted place cell activity vector, y t , and the current predicted head direction cell activity vector h t -and the goal predicted place cell activity vector , y * , and goal head direction activity vector, h * , observed the last time the agent had reached the goal -or zeros if the agent had not yet reached the goal within the episode. The convolutional network had the same architecture described for the grid cell agent. 3c -Training algorithms We assume the standard reinforcement learning setting where an agent interacts with an environment over a number of discrete time steps. As previously defined the at time t the agent receives an observation o t along with a reward r t and produces an action a t . The agent's state s t is a function of its experience up until time t, s t = f (o 1 , r 1 , a 1 , ..., o t , r t ) (The specifics of o t are defined in the architecture section). The n-step return R t:t+n at time t is defined as the discounted sum of rewards, Rt = i=0...n-1 γ i r t+i + γ n V (s t+n , θ). The value function is the expected return from state s, V π (s) = E[R t:∞ |s t = s, π], under actions selected accorded to a policy π(a|s). See main methods for the details of the loss functions. 3d -Neuroscience-based analyses of units Gridness score and grid scale calculation Following 20 and 18 spatial autocorrelograms of ratemaps were used to assess the gridness and grid scale of linear layer units. First, for each unit, the spatial autocorrelogram was calculated as defined in 20 . To calculate gridness 20 , a measure of hexagonal periodicity, we followed the 'expanding gridness' method introduced by 18 . Briefly, a circular annulus centred on the origin of the autocorrelogram was defined, having radius of 8 bins and with the central peak excluded. The annulus was rotated in 30 • increments and, at each increment, the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient with the unrotated version of itself found. An interim gridness value was then defined as the highest correlation obtained from rotations of 30, 90 and 150 • subtracted from the lowest at 0, 60 and 120 • . This process was then repeated, each time expanding the annuls by 2, up to a maximum of 20. Finally, the gridness value was taken as the highest interim score. Grid scale 20 , a simple measure of the wavelength of spatial periodicity, was defined from the autocorrelogram as follows. The six local maxima closest to but excluding the central peak were identified. Grid scale was then calculated as the median distance of these peaks from the origin. Directional measures Following 46 the degree of directional modulation exhibited by each unit was assessed using the length of the resultant vector of the directional activity map. Vectors corresponding to each bin of the activity map were created: r i =     β i cos α i β i sin α i     , (6) where α and β are, respectively, the centre and intensity of angular bin i in the activity map. These vectors were averaged to generate a mean resultant vector: r = N n=1 r i N n=1 β i , (7) and the length of the resultant vector calculated as the magnitude of r. We used 20 angular bins. Border score To identify units that were preferentially active adjacent to the edges of the enclosure we adopted a modified version of the border score 47 . For each of the four walls in the square enclosure, the average activation for that wall, b i , was compared to the average centre activity c obtaining a border score for that wall, and the maximum was used as the border-score for the unit: Threshold setting for gridness, border score, and directional measures The hexagonality of the spatial activity map (gridness), directional modulation (length of resultant vector), and propensity to be active against environmental boundaries (border scale) exhibited by units in the linear layer were benchmarked against null distributions obtained using permutation procedures 6548 . b s = max i∈{1,2,3,4} b i -c b i + c (8 For the gridness measure and border score, null distributions were constructed using a 'field shuffle' procedure equivalent to that specified by 48 . Briefly, a watershedding algorithm 64 was applied to the ratemap to segment spatial fields. The peak bin of each field was found and allocated to a random position within the ratemap. Bins around each peak were then incrementally replaced, retaining as far as possible their proximity to the peak bin. This procedure was repeated 100 times for each of the units present in the linear layer and the gridness and border score of the shuffled ratemaps assessed as before. In each case the 95th percentile of the resulting null distribution was found and used as a threshold to determine if that unit exhibited significant grid or border-like activity. To validate the thresholds obtained using shuffling procedures we calculated alternative null distributions by analysing the grid and border responses of linear units from 500 untrained networks. Again, in each case, a grid score and border score for each unit was calculated, these were pooled, and the 95th percentile found. In all cases the thresholds obtained by the first method were found to be most stringent and these were used for all subsequent analyses To establish a significance threshold for directional modulation we calculated the length of the resultant vector that would demonstrate statistically significance under a Rayleigh test of directional uniformity at α = 0.01. The resultant vector was calculated by first calculating the average activation for 20 directional bins. A threshold length of 0.47 for the resultant vector was obtained. The most stringent of these two thresholds was used. Clustering of scale in grid-like units To determine if grid-like units exhibited a tendency to cluster around specific scales we applied two methods. First, following 22 , to determine if the scales of grid-like units (gridness > 0.37, 129/512 units) followed a continuous or discrete distribution we calculated the 'discreteness measure' 22 of the distribution of their scales. Specifically, scales were binned into a histogram with 13 bins distributed evenly across a range corresponding to scales 10 to 36 spatial bins. 'Discreteness' was defined as the standard deviation of the counts in each bin. Again following 22 , statistical significance for this value was obtained by comparing it to a null distribution generated from a shuffled version of the same data. Specifically, shuffles were generated as follows: For each unit, a random number was drawn from a flat distribution between -1/2 and +1/2 of the smallest grid scale in this case between -7 and +7 spatial bins. The random number was added to the grid scales, the population was binned as before, and the discreteness score calculated. This procedure was completed 500 times. The discreteness score of the real data was found to exceed that of all the 500 shuffles (p< 0.002). Second, to characterise the number and location of scale clusters, the distribution of scales from grid-like units was fit with Gaussian mixture distributions containing 1 to 8 components. Fits were made using an Expectation-Maximization approach implemented with fitgmdist (Matlab 2016b, Mathworks, MA). The efficiency of fits made with different numbers of components was compared using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 66 the model (3 components) with the lowest BIC score was selected as the most efficient. Lesioning experiment: comparison of targeted grid unit lesion vs lesion of patchy non-grid units We lesioned a random subset of patchy multi-field spatial cells that were non-grid units (i.e. grid score lower than 0.37 threshold). The units chosen had a head-direction score lower than 0.47 and the number of spatial fields was in the same range as grid-like units (3 to 13). The number of fields in each ratemap was calculated by applying a watershedding algorithm 64 to their ratemap -ignoring fields with area smaller than 4 bins. This procedure identified 174 units as multifield patchy spatial cells (out of 256 units in the linear layer). We then selected 64 random units from these 174 and we ran 100 episodes in which these units were silenced (see Supplemental Results section 1b). We also ran another variant of the experiment where we ran 100 episodes and in each episode we selected a different subset of 64 random units from the 174 identified by the watershedding procedure, and these units were silenced. The results were not qualitatively different from the former experiment (data not shown). 3e -Multivariate decoding of representation of metric quantities within LSTM A key prediction of the vector-based navigation hypothesis is that grid codes should allow downstream regions to compute a set of metric codes relevant to accurate goal-directed navigation. Specifically, Euclidean distance and allocentric direction to the goal should both be computed by an agent using vector-based navigation (see Fig. 2j&k also 3i-k). To test whether the same representations can be found in the grid cell agent, and thereby provide additional evidence that it is indeed using a vector-based navigation strategy, we recorded the activity in the policy LSTM of the grid cell agent while it navigated in the land-maze and goal-driven environments. For each environment and agent, we collected data from 200 separate episodes. In each episode, we recorded data from the time period following the first time the agent reached the goal and was teleported to a new location in the maze. After an initial period to allow self-localization (8 steps), we examined the representation of the metric quantities over the next 12 steps, where the LSTM activity was sampled at 4 even points over those steps. We focussed on this time period because the agent potentially has knowledge of the goal location, but has not yet been able to learn the optimal path to the goal. Thus it is this initial period of time where the computation of the vector-based navigation metrics should be most useful, as this allows accurate navigation right from the start of being teleported to a new location. In the land maze task, we additionally collected the same data from a place cell agent control, and the two lesioned grid cell agents. In the goal driven task, we collected data from the place cell agent and A3C. For each agent, we applied a decoding analysis to the LSTM dictating the policy and value function. We ran two separate decoding analyses, looking for evidence of each of the two metric codes (i.e. Euclidean distance, allocentric goal direction). For each decoding analysis we trained a L2-regularized (ridge) regression model on all data apart from the first 21 time-steps of each episode. The model was then tested on the four early sampling steps of interest, where accuracy was assessed as the Pearson correlation between the predicted and actual values over the 200 episodes. The penalization parameter was selected by randomly splitting the training data into internal training and validation sets (90% and 10% of the episodes respectively). The optimal parameter was selected from 30 values, evenly spaced on a log scale between 0.001 and 1000, based on the best performance on the validation set. This parameter was then used to train the model on the full training set, and evaluated on the fully independent test set. As the allocentric direction metric is circular, we decomposed the vector into two target variables: the cosine and sine of the polar angle. All reported allocentric decoding results are the average of the cosine and sine results. For the purpose of comparing decoding accuracy across agents, we report the difference in accuracy, along with a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval on this difference, based on 10,000 samples. 3f -Statistical reporting We followed the guidelines outlined by 67 . Specifically reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals. Unless otherwise stated, the effect sizes are calculated using the following formula: ef f ect size = µ group1 -µ group2 σ pooled , (9) σ pooled = (N group1 -1) × σ 2 group1 + (N group2 -1) × σ 2 group2 N group1 + N group2 -2 The confidence interval for the effect size was calculated accordingly to 69 using: ci ef f ectsize = N group1 + N group2 N group1 × N group2 + + ef f ect size 2 2 × (N group1 + N group2 ) .

Critically, during training the corridors presenting the shortest route to the goal (i.e. the ones closer to the central room) were closed at both ends, preventing access or observation of the interior. At test time, after the agent reached the goal the first time, all doors were opened. All the agents were tested for 100 episodes, each one lasting for a fixed duration of 5, 400 environment steps (90 seconds). 47. Solstad, T., Boccara, C. N., Kropff, E., Moser, M.-B. & Moser, E. I.

The number of distinct scale clusters was assessed by sequentially fitting Gaussian mixture models with 1 to 8 components. In each case, the efficiency of the fit (likelihood vs. number of parameters) was assessed using Bayesian information criterion (BIC). BIC was minimized with three Gaussian components indicating the presence of three distinct scale clusters. b) Spatial stability of units in the linear layer of the supervised network was assessed using spatial correlations -bin-wise Pearson product moment correlation between spatial activity maps (32 spatial bins in each map) generated at 2 different points in training, t = 2e5 and t = 3e5 training steps. That is, 2 3 of the way through training and the end of training, respectively.

The grid cell agent exhibited strong generalistion performance compared to the control agents (average score over 100 episodes grid cell agent = 366.5 vs place cell agent = 175.7, effect size = 4.60, 95% CI [4.16, 5.06]; A3C agent = 219.4, effect size = 3.78, 95% CI [3.41, 4.15]). both the place cell (Euclidean distance difference in r = 0.44; 95% CI [0.37, 0.51]; Goal direction difference in r = 0.52; 95% CI [0.49, 0.56]) and deep RL (Euclidean distance difference in r = 0.57; 95% CI [0.5, 0.63]; Goal direction difference in r = 0.66; 95% CI [0.62, 0.70]) control agents (Figure3j&k). maze was size 13×13 and contained 5 evenly spaced corridors, each of which had a door at the end closest to the start position of the agent.

The grid cell agent showed markedly superior performance compared to the other agents in the "goal-doors" maze (average score over 100 episodes: grid cell agent = 284.30 vs place cell agent = 90.53, effect size = 7.86, 95% CI [7.09, 8.63]; A3C agent = 48.69, effect size = 7.73, 95% CI [6.97, 8.48]) (video of grid cell agent: 27, 95% CI [0.24, 0.29]; grid cell agent vs. A3C agent, effect size = 2.99, 95% CI [2.69, 3.29]; place cell agent vs. A3C agent, effect size = 2.92, 95% CI [2.63, 3.21]). When shortcuts become available in the test phase, the grid cell agent performs significantly better than the place agent (grid cell agent vs. place cell agent, effect size = 1.89, 95% CI [1.69, 2.09]; grid cell agent vs. A3C agent, effect size = 12.77, 95% CI [11.48, 14.07]; place cell agent vs. A3C agent, effect size = 14.87, 95% CI [13.35, 16.38]). 2 -Supplementary Discussion for Vector-based Navigation using Grid-like Representations in Artificial Agents. 106cm), indicating the presence of scale clusters with a ratio between neighbouring clusters of approximately 1.5, closely matching theoretical predictions 23 and lying within the range reported for rodents 21, 22 (Fig.1e, Extended Data Figure3).

Further, to additionally control for differences in the number and area of spatial fields between agents, we also generated two place cell agents -incorporating 256 and 660 heterogeneously sized place fields -that were explicitly matched to the grid cell agent (see Supplemental Methods for details). Again, the performance of the grid cell agent was found to be considerably better than these additional place cell agents (Average score over 100 episodes: grid cell agent = 289 vs. best place agent with 660 heterogeneous fields = 212, effect size = 3.93, 95% CI [3. 54, 4.31]; best place agent with 256 heterogeneous fields = 225, effect size = 3.52, 95% CI [3.18, 3.87]). 1b -Experimental manipulations to test the Vector-Based navigation hypothesis First, to demonstrate that the goal grid code provided sufficient information to enable the agent to navigate to an arbitrary location, we substituted it with a "fake" goal grid code sampled randomly from a location in the environment (see Methods). The agent followed a direct path to the newly specified location, circling the absent goal (Fig. 2i ) -similar to rodents in probe trials of the Morris water maze (escape platform removed). As a second test, we trained a grid cell agent without providing the goal grid vector to the policy LSTM, effectively "lesioning" this code. Performance of the grid agent drops to that of the baseline deep RL agent (A3C -a standard deep RL architecture, trained without any grid or place cell input), confirming that the goal grid code is critical for vector based navigation (see Extended Data Fig. 6c ).

INTRODUCTION Specific neuronal classes alter activity in individual downstream neurons in ways that are now beginning to be understood. However, understanding how these actions on single cells interact with network-level representations of behavioral information remains unclear. For example, in neocortex, GABAergic interneurons which express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are known to mainly inhibit other classes of GABAergic interneurons (Lee et al., 2013; Pfeffer et al., 2013; Pi et al., 2013) . Through this action, VIP interneurons disinhibit the responses of cortical excitatory neurons to various stimuli (Ayzenshtat et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2014; Karnani et al., 2016; Pi et al., 2013) , altering both network activity and behavior (Kamigaki and Dan, 2017) . However, there are many outstanding questions about the relationship between VIP interneurons, network activity, and behavior. First, can we identify specific patterns of network activity which link VIP interneurons to their behavioral effects? In particular, can we show that changes in VIP interneuron activity alter specific patterns of network activity, such that the degree of alteration predicts the magnitude of accompanying changes in behavior? Second, do the behavioral effects of manipulating VIP interneurons depend on the current state of the network and its inputs? For example, if an input is known to drive a behavior, does manipulating VIP neurons exert a consistent effect on that behavior regardless of whether that input is strong or weak? Questions like these highlight critical gaps in our current understanding of exactly how network activity mediates and modulates the behavioral effects of activity in a specific neuronal population. To address these questions, we studied the role of VIP interneurons within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in a commonly studied behavior: open arm avoidance in the elevated plus maze (EPM). The EPM comprises two exposed open arms and two closed arms surrounded by high walls, which elicit ethologically-relevant avoidance behavior that reflects the innate preference of mice for the safety of closed spaces over open ones. We first show a role for prefrontal VIP interneurons in open arm avoidance. Then we show that VIP interneurons contribute to network-level representations of the open arms. When we inhibit prefrontal VIP interneurons, the amount by which these representations change predicts the change in open arm avoidance. Prefrontal open arm representations are known to be driven by input from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) (Adhikari et al., 2011; Ciocchi et al., 2015; Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016) ; suppressing this input disrupts these representations and open arm avoidance (Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016) . We find that VIP interneurons disinhibit prefrontal responses to vHPC input, suggesting that they may contribute to prefrontal open arm representations and open arm avoidance specifically by enhancing the impact of vHPC inputs on mPFC circuits. Consistent with this model, we find that the effects of VIP interneurons on open arm avoidance change depending on the current strength of vHPC input to mPFC. Together, these results show how the recruitment of prefrontal VIP interneurons at specific times elicits synaptic actions that change network activity in ways that reshape behavior. RESULTS VIP interneuron activity increases in the open arms of the EPM. To efficiently measure VIP interneuron activity during EPM exploration, we used fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2013; Gunaydin et al., 2014) in the widely studied VIP-Cre line (Batista-Brito et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2014; Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017; Kamigaki and Dan, 2017; Khoshkhoo et al., 2017; Pfeffer et al., 2013; Pi et al., 2013) (Fig. 1A ). VIP-Cre mice were injected with adenoassociated-virus (AAV1) encoding Cre-dependent GCaMP6s in mPFC. A fiber for transmitting and collecting excitation and emission wavelengths was implanted above the site of virus injection (Fig. 1B ). Two weeks after surgery, mice explored the EPM while we measured VIP-GCaMP signals. VIP-GCaMP signals were higher in the center and open arms than the closed arms (Fig. 1C-D ), and closely tracked movement into the center or open arms (Fig. 1E and S1A ). Importantly, although VIP interneuron activity can be linked to the speed of locomotion in the open field (Fig. S1B ) (Fu et al., 2014) , we did not find a relationship between speed and prefrontal VIP GCaMP signals in the EPM (Fig. S1C-D ). This may reflect the fact that mice did not run as fast in the EPM as in the open field. We also used fiber photometry to measure signals from parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SOM) interneurons. Both PV-GCaMP and SOM-GCaMP signals were also higher in the open than closed arms. However, the encoding of EPM location (open vs. closed arms) was significantly stronger for VIP-GCaMP signals, than for PV-GCaMP or SOM-GCaMP signals (Fig. S2 ). VIP interneuron activity predicts future open arm avoidance vs. exploration. Several models could explain our finding that VIP interneuron activity is higher in the center and open arms than closed arms. One is that VIP interneuron activity drives open arm exploration. Alternatively, VIP interneuron activity might represent an anxiety-related signal that promotes open arm avoidance. In the latter model, other signals presumably drive exploration, such that decisions to explore vs. avoid reflect a competition between these proexploratory signals and VIP activity-driven avoidance. In this case, exploration would occur when exploratory signals outpace increases in VIP interneuron-driven avoidance signals during approaches to the center or open arms. A final possibility is that VIP activity does not influence or predict choices to explore vs. avoid the open arms, but is simply a readout of EPM location. First, to test whether VIP activity predicts subsequent exploration vs. avoidance, we identified all runs from a closed arm to the center, then classified each according to whether the mouse subsequently avoided or explored the open arms (closed-center-closed vs. closedcenter-open runs) . VIP-GCaMP signals in the center chamber were significantly lower for closed-center-open than closed-center-closed runs (Fig. 2A ). We also looked further back in time, comparing VIP-GCaMP signals in the closed arm, prior to entry into the center. Again, lower VIP-GCaMP signals predicted subsequent open arm exploration (Fig. 2B ). Inhibiting VIP interneurons reduces open arm avoidance. The preceding suggests that low vs. high VIP activity as mice approach the center chamber promotes subsequent open arm exploration vs. avoidance, respectively. We used optogenetics to directly test this hypothesized causal relationship. Bilateral fiber optics were implanted into the mPFC of VTP-Cre mice injected with Cre-dependent archaerhodopsin (AAV5-DIO-eArch3.0-eYFP; Arch) or eYFP (AAV5-DIO-eYFP) (Fig. 3A and S3A ). We confirmed that Arch reliably inhibited VIP interneurons in vitro (Fig. 3B ). Because VIP-GCaMP signals specifically increased in the center and open arms, we delivered 532nm light to the mPFC whenever mice were within a "stimulation zone," comprising the center, open arms, and a small portion of the closed arms abutting the center. We then compared behavior during three, 3-minute-long epochs: light OFF, followed by light ON (i.e., light was delivered only in the stimulation zone), and finally light OFF again (Fig. 3C ). We quantified light-induced changes in open arm avoidance vs. exploration via three analyses. First, during the light ON epoch, there was a significant increase in relative time spent in the open arms and open arm entries for VIP-Arch mice compared to VIP-eYFP cohorts (Fig. 3D ). There was also a corresponding decrease in closed arm entries for VIP-Arch mice (Fig. S3B ). Second, the change in time spent in the open arms in the light ON epoch compared to the preceding light OFF epoch was significantly greater for VIP-Arch mice (% change in open arm time: 176 ± 64%) than VIP-eYFP cohorts (32 ± 30%) (Fig. 3E ). Third, time spent in the open arms was significantly greater in the light ON epoch than the preceding light OFF epoch for VIP-Arch mice (Fig. 3F ) but not for VIP-eYFP controls. Interestingly, in VIP-Arch mice, open arm entries remained elevated during the light OFF epoch following the light ON epoch (Fig. 3D ). Inhibiting VIP interneurons did not affect distance travelled in the EPM (Fig. S3C ). Also notable is that inhibiting VIP interneurons did not affect open arm exploration when light was delivered continuously throughout a 3-minute epoch (Fig. S3D ), rather than triggered by entries into the center or open arms (Fig. S3E-G ). The focus of this study is on how VIP interneurons contribute to a specific behavior (open arm avoidance), rather than on how they contribute to the multifaceted entity of "anxiety" more generally. That being said, optogenetic inhibition of VIP interneurons did attenuate other "anxiety-related" behaviors in the marble-burying and light-dark box tests (Fig. S3H  -I ). VIP interneurons disinhibit prefrontal responses to hippocampal input. Given that VIP interneuron activity increases in the open arms and contributes to open arm avoidance, we decided to explore the relationship between prefrontal VIP interneurons and inputs arriving from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). vHPC inputs to mPFC differentially encode the open vs. closed arms of the EPM (Ciocchi et al., 2015) . Furthermore, mPFC neurons which encode the open vs. closed arms phase-lock to the vHPC theta rhythm suggesting they receive strong input from this source (Adhikari et al., 2011) . Indeed, inhibiting vHPC-mPFC projections suppresses single-unit mPFC activity that is specific for the open vs. closed arms, and reduces open arm avoidance (Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016) . Based on this, we hypothesized that mPFC VIP interneurons might be recruited by vHPC input and regulate prefrontal responses to that input. To test this, we first confirmed that mPFC VIP interneurons receive direct monosynaptic input from vHPC (Fig. S4A-B ). We recorded from mPFC VIP interneurons while stimulating ChR2 in vHPC terminals, and observed EPSCs in VIP interneurons in the presence of TTX (1 uM) + 4-AP (0.1 mM), which isolates monosynaptic responses (Petreanu et al., 2009) . Next, to test how mPFC VIP interneurons regulate prefrontal responses to vHPC input, we recorded from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in acute mPFC slices from VIP-Cre mice injected with two viruses: one to drive Cre-dependent expression of halorhodopsin (VIP-eNpHR) in the mPFC, and a second to express ChR2 in vHPC projection neurons. This enabled us to stimulate ChR2 in vHPC terminals with blue light flashes (5 ms at 10 Hz), with or without concomitant optogenetic inhibition of VIP interneurons (vHPC-ChR2; Fig. 4A ). Once again, optogenetic stimulation of vHPC terminals elicited excitatory synaptic responses in VIP interneurons; we also confirmed that simultaneous eNpHR stimulation hyperpolarizes VIP interneurons (Fig. S4C ). Spiking of layer 2/3 mPFC neurons in response to vHPC input was reduced when we simultaneously inhibited VIP interneurons (Fig. 4B , left). Repeating these experiments in voltage clamp revealed that inhibiting VIP interneurons significantly increases inhibitory synaptic currents evoked by optogenetic stimulation of vHPC terminals, but has no effect on excitatory currents (Fig. 4C ). Thus, VIP interneurons normally disinhibit mPFC responses to vHPC input. Inhibiting VIP interneurons disrupts prefrontal representations of the open arms. Given that they disinhibit vHPC-mPFC inputs which transmit information about whether mice are in the open vs. closed arms (Adhikari et al., 2011; Ciocchi et al., 2015) , we wondered whether prefrontal VIP interneurons might be necessary for prefrontal representations of the open vs. closed arms. To test this, we had to first identify patterns of prefrontal network activity which encode the open vs. closed arms, then determine how these are altered when we inhibit prefrontal VIP neurons. For this, we employed a dual-color microendoscope (nVoke, Inscopix) for combined GCaMP imaging of mPFC activity and activation of eNpHR in VIP interneurons (Fig. 5A-C ). We expressed GCaMP nonspecifically in mPFC neurons using the synapsin promoter; eNpHR expression was restricted to VIP interneurons using a Cre-dependent virus in VIP-Cre mice (Methods). Importantly, cross-activation of inhibitory photocurrents by wavelengths used to excite GCaMP was relatively low (Fig. S5A ). To specifically characterize network-level activity patterns, including potential nonlinear interactions between different neurons, we computed the (time-varying) matrix of correlations between signals from different neurons (Fig. S5B ). Specifically, for each pair of presumed neurons, we calculated the normalized vector dot product between the time series of GCaMP signals from one neuron and the time series of derivatives of the GCaMP signal from the other. We computed correlations between GCaMP signals and derivatives, instead of just between pairs of GCaMP signals, to minimize autocorrelations driven by shared background fluorescence. The rationale for this is that the integral of a signal with its derivative is zero over a closed path (for any signal that is differentiable in time). Thus, autocorrelation due to shared background fluorescence, which is proportional to the dot product between the background signal and its derivative, should be approximately zero. To verify that this approach works in practice, we analyzed a surrogate dataset (using the same parameters we used for our actual analysis). Each surrogate dataset signal was composed of an experimentally measured GCaMP signal, shifted in time by a random amount to make the signals independent from each other. Then we added a common signal (scaled by a random factor between -1 and 1) to each surrogate dataset signal to model shared background fluorescence. Correlations between signals in this surrogate dataset were much larger in magnitude than correlations between signals and their derivatives (Fig. S5C , left). We observed a similar difference for correlation distributions obtained from real data (Fig. S5C , right). Thus, computing correlations between GCaMP signals and their derivatives, as we have done, rather than between the signals themselves, minimizes the magnitude of correlations between signals that are nominally independent but include a component representing shared background fluorescence. As a result, this approach should make it easier to resolve physiologically meaningful correlations. Another rationale for using the derivatives of GCaMP signals to characterize network state, is that these derivatives can be more informative about neuronal firing than the GCaMP signals themselves (Markowitz et al., 2018) . Using this approach, we divided each dataset into 2.5 sec epochs, calculated the correlation matrix (between GCaMP signals and the derivatives of GCaMP signals) during each epoch, and classified each epoch based on whether the mouse was in the closed or open arms (Fig. 5D and S5B ). This allowed us to determine whether patterns of prefrontal network activity, i.e., correlation matrices, correlate with EPM behavior. Indeed, every pattern of correlations observed during an open arm epoch was more similar to other patterns of correlations observed during different open arm epochs, than to patterns observed during closed arm epochs (Fig. 5E ). Left open arm correlations were also more similar to right open arm correlations than to closed arm correlations (Fig. S5D , top), confirming that these correlations encode anxiety-related (as opposed to purely spatial) information. Importantly, this was not simply due to open arm epochs being close together in time. To show this, we time-shifted all epochs by a fixed amount, persevering their relative timing but shuffling their associated labels (i.e. open vs. closed arms). In time-shifted data, there was no difference between the left-right open arm correlation similarity and the left open arm-closed arm correlation similarity (Fig. S5D, bottom ). This finding also validates our analytical approach, because it shows that the correlation matrices we computed carry information about whether the mouse is in the open vs. closed arms. We then evaluated how inhibiting VIP interneurons affects this encoding of the open vs. closed arms. Strikingly, differences in correlations between the open and closed arms were attenuated when we inhibited VIP interneurons (Fig. 5F-G ), consistent with the behavioral effect of such inhibition to attenuate the preference for the closed vs. open arms. Importantly, only the magnitude of changes in correlations between the open vs. closed arms was altered by inhibiting VIP interneurons; the magnitude of correlations themselves was not different (p = 1 by sign-rank test). In fact, when looking on a mouse-by-mouse basis, we found a striking correlation between the degree to which VIP interneuron inhibition attenuates closed vs. open arm differences in correlations, and the degree to which that inhibition attenuates open arm avoidance (Fig. 5H ; this analysis controlled for potential sampling bias caused by different amounts of open arm exploration across mice by analyzing the same number of open or closed arm time bins in all mice). Taken together, these results demonstrate that it is in fact useful to characterize the current state of the prefrontal microcircuit by calculating the matrix of correlations between GCaMP signals and their derivatives, as we have done. Network state, defined in this way, encodes anxietyrelated information about whether mice are currently in the open vs. closed arms, and more importantly, predicts the change in open arm exploration that results from inhibiting VIP interneurons. To delve deeper into this finding, we measured how inhibiting VIP interneurons affected either GCaMP signals or their derivatives in individual neurons. For this, we computed each neuron's "preference index" during the initial light off period and subsequent light on period (Methods). A preference index of 1 or -1 indicates that activity (either GCaMP signals or their derivatives) were consistently higher in the closed or open arms, respectively; 0 indicates that activity was equal in the two chambers. For GCaMP signals, inhibiting VIP interneurons did not significantly alter the distribution of preference indices (Fig. S5E (Adhikari et al., 2011; Ciocchi et al., 2015; Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016) . Thus, one model is that inhibiting prefrontal VIP interneurons should only affect open arm avoidance when the vHPC actively transmits information to mPFC, i.e., when vHPC-mPFC communication is strong. An alternative is that prefrontal VIP interneurons make the mPFC more sensitive to weak vHPC input, such that inhibiting prefrontal VIP interneurons selectively impacts open arm avoidance when vHPC-mPFC communication is weak. A third possibility is that prefrontal VIP interneurons regulate open arm avoidance independent of vHPC input to mPFC, i.e., inhibiting VIP interneurons decreases open arm avoidance regardless of whether vHPC-mPFC communication is strong vs. weak. These models are schematized in Fig. 6A . To distinguish between these models and test whether the role of VIP interneurons in open arm avoidance depends on the current state of the vHPC-mPFC network, we measured vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony during periods of EPM exploration +/-inhibition of VIP interneurons. Theta-frequency synchronization is a marker for communication between vHPC and mPFC, particularly in anxiety-provoking environments such as the EPM (Adhikari et al., 2010; Jacinto et al., 2016; Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016) . We implanted stainless steel electrodes within the vHPC and mPFC of VIP-Arch mice (Fig. 6B and S6A ). In the mPFC, the implanted electrode was attached to one side of a bilateral fiber optic implant to record while stimulating Arch in VIP interneurons using the same location-based method described earlier. First, we tested whether inhibiting VIP interneurons directly alters vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony. For this we separated runs which entered the stimulation zone based on whether they exhibited dips or peaks in vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony at specific timepoints. Specifically, at each timepoint we z-scored vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony relative to the rest of the run. Then we separated runs based on whether this z-scored vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony was in the first (bottom), second, third, or fourth (top) quartile (Supplementary Table 1 ; Fig. 6C and S6B ). The distribution of runs in each quartile did not differ between the light ON vs. OFF conditions at the time of stim-zone entry (t = 0) or during the next 1.5 seconds (chi-squared test, p = 0.34 and 0.35, respectively). This indicates that real-time inhibition of VIP interneurons does not trigger immediate changes in theta synchrony. Next, we examined whether inhibiting VIP interneurons increases open arm exploration under all conditions, or only when vHPC-mPFC communication is strong or weak, i.e., when the z-scored theta synchrony is in the top or bottom quartile, respectively. For this we plotted the fraction of runs which avoid vs. explore the open arms as a function of quartile and light ON vs. OFF. When we inhibited VIP interneurons (light ON), we observed a dramatic increase in the fraction of top quartile runs (relatively high theta synchrony) that explored the open arms (Fig. 6D ). In fact, the majority of such runs now explored the open arms. By contrast, there was no significant change in the fraction of runs in the bottom quartile -those associated with dips in theta synchrony -which explored the open arms (Fig. 6C ). We also did not see a significant change in open arm runs for the second or third quartiles of theta synchrony (Fig. S6B ). Thus, inhibiting VIP interneurons only increases open arm exploration when vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony increases, which presumably reflects the transmission of anxiety-related information from vHPC to mPFC. By contrast, when theta synchrony dips (and vHPC-mPFC input is presumably not contributing to open arm avoidance), inhibiting VIP interneurons has no effect on open arm exploration. As a control, we also identified runs based on the top quartile of delta (1-4 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), or gamma (low: 30-58 Hz; high: 62-120 Hz) synchrony. In these cases, light delivery did not significantly alter the relative number of open vs. closed arm runs (Fig. S6C ). These results show that VIP interneurons are recruited by, and powerfully modulate, a behavior widely studied because of its presumed relevance to anxiety. In particular, our findings that VIP activity in the EPM does not correlate with running speed, but that VIP activity in a single location (the closed arm) differs based on future behavior (whether mice explore vs. avoid the open arms when they subsequently enter the center), suggests that VIP interneurons encode behavioral state, not just sensorimotor signals. Our findings also show that VIP interneurons disinhibit cortical responses to a particular source of input, are necessary for network-level representations known to depend on that input, and elicit behavioral effects that correlate strongly with changes in these network-level representations. Together, these data connect the actions of VIP interneurons across the cellular, synaptic, microcircuit, and distributed network levels, revealing the details of a mechanism through which they can alter a specific behavior. DISCUSSION There are multiple possible reasons why inhibiting VIP interneurons might decrease open arm avoidance. This manipulation might make mice unable to differentiate the open vs. closed arms, reduce physiological measures of anxiety (e.g., elevated heart rate), or simply cause mice to ignore those anxiety signals as they make decisions about whether to explore vs. avoid. Notably, inhibiting VIP interneurons while mice are exploring the EPM causes an increase in open arm exploration which outlasts the period of inhibition (Fig. 3D ). If inhibiting VIP interneurons simply renders mice unaware of whether they are in the open or closed arms, then it is hard to imagine why this would lead to long-lasting changes in open arm avoidance. Future experiments could address whether inhibiting VIP interneurons reduces physiological measures of anxiety or causes mice to ignore those signals by measuring the effects of inhibiting VIP interneurons on variables such as heart rate. In addition, most of our behavioral experiments (Fig. 1 -3) used male mice only. Other behavioral experiments (Fig. 5 6 ) used male and female mice, but in these cases, group sizes were too small to examine possible sex differences. These could be evaluated by future experiments. Location-based, but not continuous, inhibition of VIP interneurons disrupts open arm avoidance Inhibiting VIP interneurons disrupts open arm avoidance when inhibition is delivered selectively within a stimulation zone, but not when delivered continuously throughout a 3minute epoch. There are many possible explanations for this. First, EPM behavior may be particularly sensitive to changes in avoidance signals, i.e., decisions about whether to explore vs. avoid may depend on the rate at which avoidance signals rise as mice enter the center zone. In this scenario, triggering inhibition as mice approach the center may be especially effective at blunting rises in VIP interneuron activity which normally promote avoidance. Alternatively, continuous inhibition may elicit circuit adaptations which reduce its effectiveness. Interestingly, continuous eNpHR stimulation throughout a 3-minute epoch does appear to effectively suppress spiking in individual VIP interneurons (Fig. S3D ). Inhibiting VIP interneurons only disrupts open arm avoidance when vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony is high. The behavioral effects of inhibiting VIP interneurons depended strongly on the level of vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony. When synchrony was relatively high, inhibiting VIP interneurons increased open arm exploration by ~600%. By contrast, when synchrony was relatively low, inhibiting VIP interneurons did not alter open arm exploration. This is consistent with a model in which VIP interneurons normally contribute to open arm avoidance specifically by enhancing the transmission of strong anxiety-related signals from hippocampus to prefrontal cortex. Theta synchrony is thought to be a biomarker for anxietyrelated communication between these structures (Adhikari et al., 2010; Jacinto et al., 2016; Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016) . Thus, when theta synchrony is high, a channel for anxietyrelated communication between the vHPC and mPFC is effectively "open." Under these conditions, VIP interneurons can enhance prefrontal responses to the anxiety-related input coming from vHPC, thereby promoting open arm avoidance. By contrast, when theta synchrony is low, vHPC input to mPFC is either weak or unrelated to anxiety; under these conditions, the anxiety-related channel from vHPC to mPFC is effectively "closed." As a result, VIP interneurons do not contribute to open arm avoidance, and inhibiting them does not affect EPM behavior. This demonstrates that VIP interneurons do not exert a networkautonomous effect on prefrontal circuits, i.e., VIP interneurons do not simply enhance the output of specific set of prefrontal neurons that drive open arm avoidance. VIP interneurons also do not seem to amplify the behavioral effects of weak vHPC input -if they did, then the effects of inhibiting VIP interneurons should have been greatest when vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony is relatively low. Rather, the behavioral effects of inhibiting VIP interneurons are determined by the state of vHPC-mPFC communication, and VIP interneurons seem to specifically enhance the ability of strong hippocampal input to generate avoidance signals in prefrontal circuits. Interestingly, we found that mice avoid the open arms, even when vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony is low (Fig. 6D ). Under these conditions, open arm avoidance may be driven by signals which do not depend on vHPC-mPFC communication or mPFC VIP interneurons. Alternatively, when vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony is low, both exploratory and avoidance signals may be weak. As a result, inhibiting prefrontal VIP interneurons might fail to reduce open arm avoidance when vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony is low, because exploratory signals needed to drive open arm entries are absent. Finally, the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) divisions of the mPFC play different roles in fear conditioning and extinction (Do-Monte et al., 2015; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011) . By contrast, studies that have used the EPM have generally not distinguished between these subregions nor described distinct functions of PL vs. IL in EPM behavior (Adhikari et al., 2010; Adhikari et al., 2011; Ciocchi et al., 2015; Jacinto et al., 2016; Kjaerby et al., 2016; Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016) . We consistently implanted fiber optics near the PL/IL border and thus did not explore potential differences between the roles of PL and IL in EPM behavior, which could be addressed by future studies. Conclusions Previous studies of VIP interneurons have emphasized their role in disinhibition and increasing signal-to-noise at the single neuron level (Ayzenshtat et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2014; Kamigaki and Dan, 2017; Karnani et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013; Pi et al., 2013) . These single neuron changes can affect network representations (Ayzenshtat et al., 2016; Kamigaki and Dan, 2017) . Here, we reveal two additional features about how VIP interneurons act at the network level to influence behavior (Fig. 6E ). First, the degree to which manipulating VIP interneuron activity disrupts network-level representations of behaviorally-relevant information, predicts the extent to which behavior changes as a result of this manipulation (R 2 ~ 0.9). This is a key piece of evidence that the specific changes in network activity we identified may link changes in VIP interneuron activity with changes in behavior -at the very least, these patterns of network activity represent a highly informative biomarker for changes in behavior. Second, the behavioral effects of inhibiting VIP interneurons depend critically on the current state of the network. This shows that VIP interneurons do not simply excite or inhibit cells which drive open arm avoidance. Rather, VIP interneurons enable cortical circuits to integrate specific sources of input into emergent network-level representations that guide complex behaviors. STAR METHODS Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Vikaas Sohal (vikaas.sohal@ucsf.edu). All experiments were conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Panels on Laboratory Animal Care at the University of California, San Francisco. Experimental Model and Subject Details The following mouse lines (> 4 wks old) were used for behavior or photometry experiments: Vip<tm1(cre)Zjh>/J (line 010908; www.jax.org), Sst<tm2.1(cre)Zjh>/J (line 013044; www.jax.org), and B6;129P2-Pvalb<tm1(cre)Arbr>/J (line 008069; www.jax.org). Experiments using fiber photometry or optogenetic inhibition only were done with male mice only. For experiments which combined optogenetic inhibition + microendoscopic GCaMP imaging (n = 6 mice) or optogenetic inhibition + multisite LFP recording (n = 4 mice), we used both male and female mice but did not analyze the effects of sex due to the limited group size, which precluded population-level analyses in these experiments. Virus injection and fiber implantation for photometry and optogenetic experiments After isofluorane anesthesia, the scalp and periosteum were removed from the dorsal surface of the skull and scored with a scalpel to improve implant adhesion. For animals used in photometry experiments, 4 × 0.150ul of AAV2/1-Syn-FLEX-GCaMP6s (Penn Vector Core) was injected unilaterally at 4 depths (DV: -2.0, -2.25, -2.5, -2.75) at the following AP/ML (millimeters We waited 2-3 weeks before beginning behavioral experiments. For optogenetic experiments, 0.750 μl of AAV5-EF1 a-DIO-eArch3.0-eYFP or AAV5-EF1 a-DIO-eYFP (UNC Vector Core) was injected bilaterally into the medial PFC (mPFC) (Sohal et al., 2009) . Coordinates for injection into mPFC were 1.7 (AP), 0.3 (ML), and -2.6 dorsoventral (DV). We waited at least 4 weeks after injection before behavioral experiments to allow for viral expression. Mice from a single litter were arbitrarily assigned to different experimental groups. Surgical methods for fiber photometry implantation were based from protocols from Gunaydin et al., 2014. After injection of GCaMP virus, a 400/430 μm (core/outer) diameter 0.48-NA multimode fiber implant (Doric Lenses: #400/430-0.48) was slowly inserted into the mPFC until the tip of the fiber reached a DV depth of -2.25. For optogenetic behavior experiments, 200/240 μm 0.22NA dual-fiber cannulas were inserted into the mPFC at a DV depth of -2.25. Implants were affixed onto the skull using Metabond dental cement (Parkell). Fiber photometry design and analysis The photometry apparatus was based on the design described by Gunaydin et al., 2014 . A 100mW Omicron 470mW laser was optically chopped (Thorlabs, MC2000) and cleaned-up by a 470/20nm filter (Thorlabs) before hitting a 495 nm dichroic mirror (Semrock) and focused onto a custom-made 0.48-NA, 400μm multimode patch cable (Thorlabs, BFH48-400) via a FC/PC fiber collimator (Thorlabs, F240FC-A). The patch cable was friction-fit via a ferrule sleeve (Thorlabs) onto an optical fiber (Doric Lenses, #400/430-0.48) implanted into the brain as described above. A 530/20nm lens (Thorlabs) filtered the emitted light before being detected by a femtowatt photoreceiver (Newport, Model 2151). The photoreceiver was attached to a X-Y translator (Thorlabs, ST1XY-A) and adjustable lens tube (Thorlabs, SM1NR1) to assist in aligning the light path. Emitted light was focused onto the photoreceiver via a plano-convex lens (Thorlabs, F = 50.0, N-BK7) housed in the lens tube. All optical equipment were mounted onto an aluminum breadboard (Thorlabs). A lockin amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR810 DSP) whose sampling interval was locked to the optical chopper filtered the signals from the photoreceiver. A digital acquisition board (Labjack) streamed the data onto a personal computer for off-line data analysis. For calculating mean GCaMP signals during eventual open vs. closed arm runs, an observer scored each run (as an eventual open vs. closed arm run) and marked the frames where the animal initiated its run, entered/exited the center zone, and ended its run. The observer was blinded to the corresponding GCaMP signals during this analysis. Behavioral assays Mice were housed in reversed 12-h light/dark cycles, and all experiments were performed during the dark portion of the cycle. After sufficient time for surgical recovery and viral expression, mice underwent multiple rounds of habituation. The testing room was illuminated at 150 lux, and mice were first habituated to the behavioral testing area for 30 minutes prior to the beginning of any further handling each day. Mice were then habituated to touch with at least 3 days of handling for ~5 min each day, followed by 1-2 days of habituation to the optical tether in their home cage for 10 min. Next, mice were placed into a larger housing cage for 1-2 days for 10 min where they habituated to the tether as they explored the novel environment. Elevated plus maze: After habituation, behavior was assessed using the elevated plus maze (EPM). EPM sessions lasted 9 minutes, with the laser stimulation delivered during the second three-minute epoch to activate Arch (532nm, . eYFP-expressing mice served as controls, i.e., they also received continuous 532nm light when in the stimulation zone. Real-time light delivery was based on the location in the EPM apparatus, with the stimulation zones demarcated as the open arms, center zone, and the closed arm zone proximal (within one quarter-length) to the center zone. Marble burying test: The marble-burying assay was performed as described in (Kedia and Chattarji, 2014) . Mice were allowed to explore a standard mouse cage filled with white Alfa Dry bedding (depth of 4-5 cm) for 10 minutes for habituation. Twenty glass marbles were then placed in a 4×5 configuration, and mice were allowed to explore the cage for another 20 minutes, during which we performed video recording for subsequent offline analysis. Optogenetic stimulation (continuous 532nm light, ~5-7mW) was delivered in alternating 5 min-long epochs (light ON, light OFF, light ON, light OFF). An experimenter, blinded to the virus injected into each mouse (eYFP vs. eArch), scored the video recordings to determine the 1) latency to dig during epoch one, and 2) total time spent digging during light ON epochs. One mouse was excluded from analysis due to its optical tether being caught by the lixit port. Light-dark box test: The light-dark box was designed as described in (Anthony et al., 2014) with the following dimensions (overall, 50 × 25 × 30 cm): light side 31 cm long, dark side 16 cm long; doorway between light and dark sides, 5.25 cm wide and 3 cm long. Mice were placed into the dark side of the chamber, and the optogenetic stimulation was triggered by entry into the center tunnel and light side of the box during the light ON epochs. The entire experiment consisted of 4 minute-long epochs in the following order: light OFF, light ON, light OFF. A USB webcam (Logitech) connected to a computer running ANY-maze (Stoelting) was used to track the position of the mouse in behavioral apparatuses, trigger optogenetic stimulation, and sync electrophysiology data to animal position. Analyses were performed offline using custom MATLAB code. The sample sizes of our cohorts are in ranges commonly found in experiments using elevated plus maze to assay anxiety-like behaviors. Animals were randomly assigned to a virus cohort (eArch vs eYFP), and the experimenter was blinded to each mouse's virus assignment when the behavioral assessment was performed. Slice preparation and in vitro recording parameters Slice preparation and intracellular recording followed our published protocol (Sohal and Huguenard, 2005) . Briefly, we cut 250 μm coronal slices from 8-to 11-week-old mice of either sex and secured the tissue onto the recording platform using a harp. Whole-cell patch recordings were obtained from VIP cells expressing fluorophore-labeled opsins or visually identified pyramidal cells in layer II/III of infralimbic or prelimbic cortex using differential contrast video microscopy on an upright microscope (BX51WI; Olympus). Recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700A (Molecular Devices). For voltage-clamp recordings, patch electrodes (tip resistance = 2-6 MΩ) were filled with the following (in mM): 130 Csmethanesulfonate, 4 NaCl, 2 MgCl 2 , 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 TEA, 5 QX-314, 2 MgATP, and 0.5 Na 3 GTP (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Cells were held at -70 mV and +10 mV to isolate EPSCs and IPSCs, respectively (Fig. 4C ). For recordings of cell-intrinsic properties, patch electrodes (tip resistance = 1-4 MOhms) were filled with the following (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl, 2 MgATP, and 0.3 NaGTP (pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH). All recordings were at 32.0±1°C. Series resistance was usually 10-20 MQ, and experiments were discontinued above 25 MΩ. The Vip<tm1(cre)Zjh>/J (line 010908; www.jax.org) mouse line was used for slice experiments. A light-emitting LED engine (Lumencor) was used to elicit photo-induced currents. We stimulated ChR2-infected fibers or cell bodies with ~1-3 mW of 470 nm light with pulses of 5 ms in duration. eArch-infected cell bodies were stimulated with ~4-5 mW of 550/15 nm light. The light path was delivered to the slice via a 40x objective (Olympus) and illuminated across the full high-power (40x) field. For patch-clamp experiments measuring the effects of VIP interneuron inhibition on responses to theta frequency stimulation of vHPC inputs, VIP-ires cre mice were injected with 2× 0.450ul of AAV5-EF1 a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCh ("eNpHR"; DV: -2.3, -2.6; UNC Vector Core) using the stereotactic coordinates for mPFC listed earlier, and 0.650ul of AAV5-CaMKII-ChR2-eYFP (UNC Vector Core) into the vHPC (-3.25 AP, 3.1 ML, -4.1 DV). Coronal slices were prepared ~5 weeks later, and ChR2 expression in the ventral hippocampus was confirmed in all cases at the start of each experiment. To increase the spontaneous network activity in vitro, active aCSF (3.5mM KCl, 11mM glucose, 123mM NaCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgSO 4 ) was washed on for five minutes after initiating each recording from a layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron. We targeted visually-identified layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons adjacent to eNpHR-infected VIP neurons for recording (Fig. 4A ). The optogenetic stimulation protocol comprised of 80sec long sweeps. Each sweep was broken up as follows: a 10 sec period of ChR2 stimulation (1-5mW, 5ms light flashes delivered at 10 or 25Hz using a LED engine (Lumencor) emitting 440/20 nm and 470/24nm), followed by a 30sec recovery period, then another 10 sec period of concurrent ChR2 + eNpHR stimulation (constant 2mW light, with the LED engine emitting 640/30nm). DC current (20-60pA) was injected to elicit submaximal levels of spiking. Cells with unstable resting membrane potentials were excluded from analyses. For patch-clamp experiments verifying levels of cross-activation by GCaMP excitation wavelength on halorhodopsin photocurrents, VIP-ires-cre mice were injected with 2× 0.450ul of AAV5-EF1a-DI0-eNpHR3.0-mCh (DV: -2.3, -2.6; UNC Virus Core) using mPFC stereotactic coordinates described earlier, and coronal sections were harvested ~5 weeks later. We then patched clamped prefrontal VIP neurons infected with Cre-dependent halorhodopsin while administering light approximating in vivo recording conditions: GCaMP excitation light (470nm, 200uW) and halorhodopsin excitation light (640/30nm, 2.25mW). Our LED engine was unable to deliver greater than 2.25mW of 600nm light in vitro. Surgery and analysis of LFP experiments Following virus injection, standard-tip 0.5 MΩ-impedance stainless steel electrodes (Microprobes, SS30030.5A10) were inserted into the mPFC, vHPC, and BLA. For the mPFC location, an optrode (optical fiber + electrode) was custom-made by affixing the electrode to the right optical fiber of a dual-fiber cannula. The tip of the electrode protruded beyond the fiber tip by 200-500μm. The coordinates for vHPC and BLA were as follows: vHPC, -3.25 (AP), 3.1(ML), -4.1 (DV); BLA, -1.34 (AP), 3.12 (ML), -4.74 (DV). A common reference screw was implanted into the cerebellum (500 μm posterior to lambda) and a silver ground wire was placed underneath the left lateral scalp. After affixing the electrodes in place using Metabond, connections were made to the headstage of a multichannel recording system (Pinnacle). All channels shared a common reference (cerebellum). Data was collected at 2000 Hz and band-pass filtered 1-200Hz at the pre-amp. Electrode placement was verified histologically. We also examined the power spectra from all electrodes; only animals with vHPC power spectra that exhibited a visible peak in the theta frequency range were used for further analysis. (Note for one mouse, we were not able to verify the localization of the vHPC electrode because the brain was blocked too far rostrally during histology; however, we did not exclude this mouse from analysis because its vHPC electrode exhibited a clear theta peak). Analysis of LFP data was facilitated using custom MATLAB code. The LFP signals were FIR-filtered (filter length 3x period corresponding to minimum frequency of frequency band) and Hilbert transformed to yield the instantaneous amplitudes (magnitude) and phases (angle). The amplitude covariation between regions in a particular frequency band was calculated by the maximum normalized cross correlation of the instantaneous band-pass filtered amplitudes of each electrode. Amplitude covariation in the theta, beta, and gamma bands was calculated using a 2.5 second window, at 1.5 sec intervals from 7.5 seconds before to 7.5 seconds after the animal entered the stimulation zone of the EPM. For the delta band, amplitude covariation was calculated using a 10 second window (in order to sample a similar number of cycles). Amplitude covariation was individually z-scored for each stimzone entry, i.e., each run. Each run is an approach to the center starting from a closed arm. A run was defined as an open run if mice proceeded into the open arms and closed run if they either crossed through the center directly to the other closed arm or retreated back into the starting arm. Z-scored amplitude covariation values were classified into quartiles by pooling z-scores from all mice and all conditions. Surgery, histology, and analysis of optogenetic endoscope experiments For endoscope experiments, 4× 0.150ul of AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6m (DV: -2.0, -2.25, -2.5, -2.75; diluted 1:4; UPenn Virus Core) and 2× 0.450ul of AAV5-EF1 a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCh (DV: -2.3, -2.6; UNC Virus Core) were injected into the mPFC using stereotactic coordinates described earlier. Following viral injection, a 0.5mm diameter x 6.1mm long GRIN lens (Inscopix) was slowly advanced into the mPFC until the tip was placed at DV -2.25 and cemented in place with Metabond dental cement. After 2-3 weeks of viral expression, an imaging baseplate was positioned over the GRIN lens and cemented in place. The mice were allowed to recover for another 2 weeks before the beginning of habituation. Mice were perfused using standard transcardial perfusion with PBS and 4% PFA, and brains were post-fixed for at least one day. Tissue (75 μm thick coronal sections) was obtained on vibratome, and immunohistochemistry was performed on floating 75 μm coronal sections using chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Aves Lab, GFP-1020), rabbit anti-DsRed (1:500; Clontech, #632496) antibodies, and corresponding AlexaFluor 488 and 594 secondary goat antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen, A-11039, R37117). Images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM confocal. nVistaHD and nVoke software (Inscopix) were used to control the microscope and collect imaging data. Images were acquired at 20 frames per second using an imaging LED power of ~150-250 μW and stored off-line for data processing. An input TTL from a separate Anymaze computer triggered the optogenetic LED (6-8 mW) and synced imaging timestamps to positional tracking. Imaging data was downsampled 2x in the x-and y-directions. To increase contrast for motion correction, frames were FFT bandpass filtered (3-40 pixels; ImageJ) and an unsharp mask (radius 10 pixels, 0.60 mask weight; ImageJ) was applied. Motion correction was then performed using a template-matching algorithm (normalized correlation coefficient; ImageJ) with a high-contrast subregion selected as the reference. Analysis of the dataset using a modified PCA/ICA approach (Luongo et al., 2016a; Luongo et al., 2016b) detected 80-90 ROIs (presumed neurons) per field of view (Fig. 5B ). To describe patterns of local microcircuit activity, matrices of correlations between VIP signals and their time derivatives were calculated with a window of 2. Calculation of preference index values The preference index (P.I.) value of each cell was calculated by first assigning pixel values to a map of the EPM based on the cumulative sum of the z-scored calcium signal or its timederivative whenever the mouse is physically occupying a pixel on the EPM map. This cumulative map is then normalized by the amount of time the mouse spends in each pixel on the EPM map. The top 5% of pixels of the normalized map are then considered significant pixels, and P.I. is calculated by: P . I . = P o -P c P o + P c where P o is the percentage of significant open-arm pixels and P c is the percentage of significant closed-arm pixels, over all open-and closed-arm pixels respectively. The openarm pixels are defined as the areas comprising the open arms and the center of the EPM, while the closed-arm pixels make up the rest of the EPM. This procedure can be repeated separately for each of the three epochs to get the P.I. for each cell during each of the three epochs. Statistics, data analysis, and data availability Unless otherwise specificed, nonparametric tests or ANOVA was used to assess signficance. Statistics were calculated using either custom MATLAB code or Graphpad Prism. All statistical parameters, including test statistics, correction for multiple comparisons, and sampling of repeated measurements are stated in the main text. All tests are two-sided, and error bars represent SEM. The code and data used to generate and support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. See also Figure S3 . S1 . , top). However, for derivatives of GCaMP signals, inhibiting VIP interneurons significantly decreased the absolute value of preferences indices (Fig. S5E, bottom). Thus, inhibiting VIP interneurons disrupts network-level representations of the open vs. closed arms by suppressing the tendency for individual GCaMP signals to preferentially rise in either the open or closed arms. Inhibiting VIP interneurons only reduces open arm avoidance when hippocampalprefrontal theta synchrony is strong. Our previous results show that inhibiting prefrontal VIP interneurons weakens mPFC responses to vHPC input, mPFC representations of the open arms, and open arm avoidance. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that VIP interneurons contribute to open arm avoidance by enhancing the transmission of open arm-related information from vHPC to mPFC. Input from the vHPC to mPFC drives mPFC activity, which differentiates between the open vs. closed arms and open arm avoidance We have elucidated the role of prefrontal VIP interneurons in a distributed hippocampalprefrontal network regulating open arm avoidance in the EPM. Prefrontal VIP interneurons not only encode whether mice are in the open/closed arms of the EPM, but more strikingly, predict future open arm exploration vs. avoidance. VIP interneurons receive vHPC input and disinhibit prefrontal responses to that input. Inhibiting VIP neurons disrupts the prefrontal encoding of open vs. closed arms. This specifically increases open arm exploration during periods of high vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony, which indicate the transmission of anxiety signals from vHPC to mPFC. These observations suggest that prefrontal VIP interneurons normally disinhibit prefrontal responses to vHPC input, thereby helping to generate prefrontal representations of the open vs. closed arms, which contribute to open arm avoidance. Specifically high VIP interneurons activity in the open arms will enhance prefrontal responses to vHPC inputs during open arm exploration, producing patterns of open arm activity distinct from those observed in the closed arms, as seen in our imaging experiments. This is schematized in Fig. 6E. 5 sec and matched to the mouse's EPM position (in closed vs open arm). Specifically, we calculated each correlation by computing the normalized vector dot product between a time series of GCaMP signals and a time series of derivatives (corresponding to a different neuron). The example closed and open arm correlation matrices in Fig. 5D were generated by finding the mean of twenty randomly selected correlation matrices from in-closed and in-open arm periods for one mouse. To calculate the similarity of open arm correlation matrices to other open or closed arm correlation matrices in Fig. 5E, we calculated the matrix dot-product of an individual open arm correlation matrix with every other open or closed arm matrix and plotted the mean matrix dot-product for open (x-axis) and closed (y-axis) arm comparisons. Thus, each point in Fig. 5E marks the average similarity of a given open arm correlation matrix to all other closed (y-axis) or open (x-axis) arms. Likewise, each open arm epoch was assigned either a left or right open arm position, and the similarity was computed for each left open arm correlation matrix with every right open (x-axis) or closed arm (y-axis) matrix in Fig. S4C. Fig. 5F describes how the distribution of correlations with significant (p < 0.01) differences between closed and open arm is altered by VIP inhibition. First, open and closed arm correlation matrices were collected for each three-minute epoch. For each neuron, an unpaired student's t-test was used to determine if that given neuron had correlations that were statistically significant (p < 0.01) between closed and open arms. To determine the change in correlation between open and closed arms, the mean correlation of closed arms was subtracted from the mean correlation of open arms for each neuron. Thus, each panel in Fig. 5F shows the distribution of correlations that significantly increased or decreased between closed and open arms in epoch one (top) and two (bottom) with a significance set at p < 0.01. To correlate the effect of VIP inhibition on distribution of significantly different correlations (Fig. 5G-H), we determined the percent-change, from epoch 1 to 2, in correlation strength, which was simply the distance between means (Fig. 5F, red arrows). Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. Prefrontal VIP neuron activity reflects elevated plus maze behavior. (A) Fiber photometry design. An optical fiber delivered 473nm light to mPFC to excite GCaMP6s. GCaMP6s fluorescence was detected and streamed to an acquisition computer using a lock-in amplifier synchronized to an optical chopper. (B) VIP-Cre mice were injected with AAV-hSyn-FLEX-GCaMP6s. A 400μm optical fiber was implanted with its tip near the prelimbic/infralimbic border (left, DAPI; right, VIP-GCaMP; scale bars: 300 and 90 μm, respectively). (C) Heatmaps showing the average GCaMP signal from VIP neurons in two individual mice as a function of EPM location. VIP GCaMP signals were highest in the center for a mouse that did not explore the open arms (left); for a mouse that did explore the open arms, VIP GCaMP signals were highest in the open arms (right). (D) Distributions of VIP-GCaMP signals (dF/F0) in different EPM zones: the closed arms (blue), center zone (green), or open arms (red) (n = 5 mice). Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2. VIP interneurons predict future exploration vs. avoidance. (A) Average VIP-GCaMP signals in the center zone were lower just prior to runs into the open arms than before runs into the closed arms (ANOVA using mouse and run type as factors; run type: F 1,77 = 6.18, p = 0.015; n = 8 mice). Whereas Fig. 1D only includes data from 5 VIP-GCaMP mice run concurrently with PV-GCaMP or SOM-GCaMP mice, this figure includes data from 3 additional VIP-GCaMP mice run subsequently. (B) Average VIP-GCaMP signals were lower during runs on which mice subsequently entered the open arms compared to those on which mice subsequently entered closed arms (ANOVA using mouse and run type as factors; run type: F 1,77 = 4.1, p = 0.046; n = 8 mice). Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3. Inhibiting prefrontal VIP neurons increases open arm exploration. (A) Dual fiber optics were implanted in mPFC near the prelimbic/infralimic border, in VIP-Cre mice injected with AAV to drive Cre-dependent expression of Arch (scale bars, 500 and 250 μM, respectively). (B) Example current clamp responses of prefrontal VIP neurons to Arch stimulation using constant 532nm green light (~5mW). (C) Protocol for "location based" optogenetic stimulation in the EPM. Stimulation (532nm light to activate Arch) was delivered when the mouse entered the stimulation zone (red) during the second 3-minute epoch of EPM exploration. (D) Inhibiting VIP neurons (green) increased relative open arm time (left) and open arm entries (right) compared to control mice (open arm time: Z = 2.16, *p = 0.03, rank-sum test; open arm entries: Z = 2.69, **p < 0.01, rank-sum test).

Introduction Urination (aka. micturition) is a fundamental behavior that requires coordination of the bladder and urethral sphincter [1] [2] [3] . Humans urinate involuntarily and reflexively at birth but acquire voluntary control with learning and development. Unfortunately, this motivated control is ultimately disrupted in one in three adults worldwide 4 . The neurons in the brain that control urination remain obscure, partly because most studies have focused on reflex urination, where bladder filling and voiding can be easily controlled and monitored in anesthetized animals. However, voluntary urination occurs before the bladder reaches capacity and must be studied in awake, behaving animals. Because of this experimental complication, there is little understanding of the neural substrates underlying natural, voluntary urination behavior and continence. House pets commonly demonstrate that many animals, in addition to humans, can learn to control urination behavior. Moreover, territorial males of many wild animals including fish 5 , rodents 6, 7 , and primates 8 deliberately urinate their domain to transmit social scents such as pheromones. Male mice in particular scent-mark prolifically 7, 6 in order to attract female mating partners. However, exuberant urination behavior is metabolically wasteful 9 and may attract other aggressive males 10 or predators 11 . Mice offset these risks by limiting voluntary scent marks to critical social environments such as those most likely to contain females 6 . Therefore, the use of female odor to promote rapid and robust scent marking behavior in the male mouse serves as an experimental platform to identify neurons controlling voluntary urination. The switch from urine storage to deliberate elimination is known to depend on brain input, as spinal cord injury acutely prevents voluntary urination. Barrington's nucleus (Bar, aka. pontine micturition center, PMC, M-region), is a well-conserved and heterogeneous population of neurons in the dorsal pons that was identified as the major brain center regulating urination almost a century ago 12, 13 . Bar contains at least three different cell types defined by physiology 14 , gene expression 13, 15 , and histology 13, 16, 17 . The best-studied among these express corticotropin releasing hormone/factor (CRH or CRF) [18] [19] [20] 2 . Ba CRH neurons increase their firing rate under anesthetized bladder and colon distension as well as during awake, diuretic-induced urination 21, 15 . Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of these neurons generates an increase in bladder pressure 15 . However, the smooth muscle of the bladder wall contracts slowly via autonomic, involuntary control, which alone is not sufficient for voiding. Urine release is ultimately gated by the external urethral sphincter (EUS), which is normally constricted but relaxes to allow urine flow (Fig. 1a ). In humans, this relaxation precedes bladder contraction and initiates voluntary urination 22, 23 . The EUS is composed of striated muscle to permit fast control via somatic, voluntary motoneurons, which are monosynaptically inhibited by interneurons in the dorsal grey commissure (DGC) in the spinal cord [24] [25] [26] . Broad electrical or chemical stimulation of Bar drives urination 27, 28 , and current models assume that this occurs through a single, divergent Bar projection to the spinal cord to control both bladder and EUS 1, 15 . However, Bar neurons that relax the urethral sphincter have not been identified. Here we establish a voluntary urination assay in male mice by quantifying their rapid generation of scent marks following detection of female odor. We find that this behavior depends upon a previously uncharacterized subpopulation of spatially clustered neurons in Bar that express high levels of estrogen receptor 1 (Bar ESR1 ). These neurons project heavily to the DGC and increase their activity in freely behaving mice just prior to voluntary scent marking urination. Bar ESR1 neurons drive efficient voiding when photostimulated in awake animals, and urinary muscle recordings in anesthetized animals indicate a unique mechanistic role in urethral sphincter relaxation. Chemogenetic inhibition of Bar ESR1 but not Bar CRH neurons abolishes natural scent-marking urination, and acute Bar ESR1 photoinhibition abruptly terminates ongoing EUS relaxation. Thus, Bar ESR1 neurons are indispensable for driving urethral relaxation and voluntary urination in male mice and provide a promising tool for the future study of continence and incontinence. Results A novel cell type in Barrington's nucleus with a role in urination Our initial tests and a previous study of Bar CRH neural function showed modest effects on urination in awake animals 15 , suggesting that they are unlikely to facilitate voluntary urination. Approximately half of the Bar neurons projecting to the spinal cord lack CRH expression 19 , and their molecular identity and function is undetermined 13 . We took a candidate approach to identify molecular markers for Bar neurons that may function to promote urinary sphincter relaxation, and focused on estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1, ERα), as it is expressed in a subset of Bar cells in both mice 17 and primates 29 . It is unknown if ESR1 marks a cell type distinct from Bar CRH . Immunostaining for ESR1 protein in CRH-Cre x ROSA-LSL-tdTomato (CRH-tdT) individuals confirmed a small Bar subpopulation (~200 cells) expressing high amounts of ESR1 (Bar ESR1 neurons, Fig. 1b-f ). The majority of Bar ESR1 neurons (~3/4 of the Bar ESR1 population, Fig. 1f ) do not overlap with CRH-tdT, and the overlapping minority likely represents an upper bound on co-expression since tdT integrates Crh promoter activity over the lifetime of the animal. Bar ESR1 neurons are found in a dorsal cluster within the Nissl-defined ovoid Bar nucleus, whereas Bar CRH neurons are more numerous (~500 cells 15 ), ventrally biased, and extend further along the rostrocaudal axis beyond traditional, Nissl-defined Bar borders (Fig. 1d-e ). Moreover, in ESR1-Cre mice, 96.8 % of Bar ESR1 neurons (n=3 mice) overlap with reporter expression (Supplementary Fig. 1a ), confirming that the Crh and Esr1 promoters are active in largely independent Bar populations. To investigate the potential for Bar ESR1 neurons to relax the urethral sphincter, we evaluated their neurotransmitter identity and anatomical connections to the lower urinary tract. Immunostaining for αESR1 in Vgat-Cre and Vglut2-Cre mouse lines crossed to fluorescent reporters, as well as in-situ hybridization, revealed that the majority of Bar ESR1 neurons express Vglut2 (93.6 % reporter overlap, n=3 mice) and not Vgat (2.2 % reporter overlap, n=4 mice; Supplementary Fig. 1b-k ). Injection of the retrograde tracer CTB into the lumbosacral spinal cord resulted in co-expression with Bar ESR1 cells, indicating their direct projections to urinary targets (Supplementary Fig. 1l-n ). To further investigate Bar ESR1 axonal projections, we unilaterally injected AAV expressing Cre-dependent GFP into the Bar of ESR1-Cre or CRH-Cre animals, and imaged the lower thoracic to sacral spinal cord (Fig. 1g, h, j ). The lumbosacral mediolateral column (ML) contains preganglionic autonomic neurons that excite the bladder (along with intermingled interneurons) 1, 26 , and the lumbosacral dorsal grey commissure (DGC) contains interneurons that directly inhibit (relax) sphincter motorneurons of the dorsolateral nucleus via Bar input [24] [25] [26] (Fig. 1k ). Consistent with the known role in bladder pressure regulation, Bar CRH-GFP axons showed a dense focal projection to the ML (Fig. 1g -h top row, l) with only sparse fibers arching further medially or to thoracolumbar levels T13-L2 (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b ). Bar ESR1-GFP axons projected similarly across the lumbosacral ML, with additional lighter fibers seen in the thoracolumbar ML (Supplementary Fig. 2c ). However, they also provided much denser innervation of the sphincter-inhibiting DGC, extending rostrally from the proposed L3-L4 burst generator 30 to mid-sacral levels (Fig. 1g -h bottom row, l; Supplementary Fig. 2c ). Bilateral labeling of Bar ESR1 or Bar CRH neurons with a second Cre-dependent virus (AAV-FLEX-ChR2) confirmed the same projection patterns (Fig. 1i ; Supplementary Fig. 2b-c ). Thus, the cell body distribution, molecular expression, and efferents of Bar ESR1 neurons indicate that they constitute an uncharacterized cell type within Bar 13 , distinct from Bar CRH neurons. Upon detecting the odor of a female, male mice promptly urinate to show their command of the territory and advertise their availability to mate 7, 31 . We promote this voluntary urination by adding female odor (female urine) to an arena lined with absorbent paper and record the male's position from above and their urine output from below. This enables quantification of both the timing and abundance of voluntary urination events during freely moving behavior (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). To determine the temporal activation of Bar ESR1 cells in relationship to this natural urination behavior, we unilaterally injected Bar with AAV-FLEX-GCaMP6s in ESR1-Cre animals and imaged population calcium activity with fiber photometry (Fig. 2a-b ). We observed robust, discrete increases in fluorescence that were highly correlated with detected urination events, compared to randomly chosen intervals (Fig. 2c-e ). The lags for maximal cross correlation between urine detection and GCaMP fluorescence transients revealed no significant difference between the timing of Bar ESR1 population activity and urine marks (GCaMP precedes by 0.37 ± 0.16 seconds, mean ± s.e.m., n=76 urination events across 7 mice, p = 0.18, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Altogether, we find that ESR1 defines a novel cell type in Bar with anatomical and physiological features consistent with a direct role in urination. Artificial activation of Bar ESR1 neurons promotes urination in awake and anesthetized animals Bar CRH-ChR2 photostimulation was previously shown to drive bladder pressure increases during urethane-anesthetized cystometry 15 , but the sufficiency of these cells in awake urination has not been characterized. To determine if either of these distinct Bar populations promote urination in behaving animals, we first bilaterally infected Bar ESR1 or Bar CRH neurons with AAV-FLEX-ChR2 or -GFP (Bar ESR1-ChR2 , Bar ESR1-GFP , or Bar CRH-ChR2 , Fig. 3a-c ) and performed slice recordings to confirm that both Bar ESR1-ChR2 and Bar CRH-ChR2 neurons reliably responded to photostimulation at frequencies previously used in electrical stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). We then quantified and compared the latency and amount of urine induced by photostimulation in awake, freely-moving individuals without urine-promoting odor cues. While photostimulation of GFP-infected individuals produced no effect on urine excretion, Bar ESR1-ChR2 stimulation led to robust, frequency-dependent urine volume released, following light onset with a mean latency of 2.1 seconds (Fig. 3d-h ; Suppl. Video 1). Over 96% of Bar ESR1-ChR2 stimulation trials at 10-50 Hz resulted in urination (Fig. 3d, f ). In comparison, photostimulation of Bar CRH-ChR2 neurons during freely-moving behavior had a much smaller effect on urination despite generally higher ChR2 viral infection levels (Fig. 3c-h ; Suppl. Video 2). Less than 37% of Bar CRH-ChR2 stimulation trials at 10-50 Hz resulted in the voiding of urine (Fig. 3f ). Of this subset, the latency and amount of urine produced differed from Bar ESR1-ChR2 at all frequencies tested (Fig. 3d-h ). We additionally investigated the extent to which Bar ESR1 and Bar CRH neural activity could initiate voiding without conscious sensory input. Photostimulation under isoflurane anesthesia, known to depress reflex urination 32, 33 , resulted in urine voiding in 43% of the Bar ESR1-ChR2 trials, but only 6% of the Bar CRH-ChR2 trials, with none of the Bar CRH-ChR2 voids occurring during the photostimulus window (Fig. 3f , i; Suppl. Video 3). This indicates that Bar ESR1 neuronal activity induces rapid and efficient urination and hints at a distinct mechanism from neighboring Bar CRH activity that is known to increase bladder pressure. Bar ESR1 neurons drive urination by controlling the urethral sphincter To directly test the effect of Bar ESR1 and Bar CRH neurons on urinary muscle targets, we performed external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) and cystometry (bladder filling and pressure recording) under isoflurane anesthesia (Fig. 4a ). We perfused saline at a constant rate into the bladder to stimulate reflex voiding and observed natural cycles of bladder pressure increase and associated EUS bursting muscle patterns, which correlated with voiding and subsequent bladder pressure decrease (Fig. 4b ). In rodents, these bursting contractions interspersed with periods of muscle relaxation are believed to enable efficient urine flow through the narrow rodent urethra 34, 35 . Following observation of regular cystometry cycles, we stopped the saline pump when the bladder was "filled" or "empty" (75% or 10% of the volume observed to trigger reflex urination, respectively) and initiated 5 seconds of photostimulation (Fig. 4b , blue arrows). We found that both Bar ESR1-ChR2 and Bar CRH-ChR2 photostimulation produced reliable, time-locked bladder pressure increases at similar latencies (Fig. 4c-d ). The initial latency and slope of the bladder pressure increase by stimulation of each cell type was indistinguishable by our analysis; however, the peak pressure and end pressure (25 seconds after stimulus onset) were significantly less for Bar ESR1-ChR2 photostimulation. This difference occurs because only with the Bar ESR1-ChR2 photostimulation did we observe abundant urine release, which results in a sharp pressure decrease below the starting value (Fig. 4c-f ; Suppl. Video 4). When Bar CRH-ChR2 photostimulation ceased, the bladder usually returned to the same pressure level observed prior to Bar CRH-ChR2 stimulation (Fig 3c-d, f ), independently confirming our observations that significant urine release does not normally occur through activation of this cell population (Suppl. Video 5). The reason for the observed differences in photostimulated urine release only become clear when examining the EUS EMG responses. The photostimulated urination in Bar  mice coincided with a reliable bursting pattern of sphincter activity, the extent of which was dependent on bladder fill level (Fig. 5a-b ; Supplementary Fig. 5a-b ). Pulsatile urination occurred during the bursting periods (Suppl. Video 4), consistent with previous observations of urine flow during the relaxation periods between bursts 34, 35 and our calculations of relaxation time between burstlets (Fig. 5c-d ). Frequency analysis of the sphincter EMG signal also shows that 85% of the Bar ESR1-ChR2 stimulations with a filled bladder resulted in sphincter relaxation/bursting and associated voiding (Fig. 5e-f ; Supplementary Fig. 5a-b ). Additionally, we observed burst-like EMG responses in the absence of bladder contractions on a subset of empty bladder trials (Supplementary Fig. 6 ), such that the effect of Bar ESR1 neurons on the sphincter cannot be solely due to reflex activity from bladder afferents. In contrast, photostimulation of Bar CRH-ChR2 neurons produced either no detectible change in sphincter activity, tonic sphincter discharge (constriction), or rare irregular bursting (13% of trials), which was always preceded by tonic (constricting) activity and accompanied by bladder pressure increase (Fig. 5b, c-e ). This tonic activity increase was characteristic of a spinal guarding reflex, a compensatory tonic contraction of the EUS mediated through bladder afferents to prevent urination during bladder distension. The extent to which urethral sphincter bursting occurs during natural, awake rodent behavior varies across sex and species [34] [35] [36] [37] and remains controversial. Thus, to investigate natural sphincter activity, we surgically implanted a wireless pressure recorder into the corpus spongiosum that surrounds the urethra and can serve as a proxy for the urethral activity, where bursting duration corresponds to the amount of urine release 38 . Upon recovery, we analyzed the urination behavior in response to odor cues and found urethral sphincter bursting patterns to occur during the awake behavior (Supplementary Fig. 5c-f ). Notably, the duration and slope of the spectral power seen during the Bar ESR1-ChR2 photostimulation bursts mimicked wirelessly recorded pressure during awake, natural scent-marking urination (Supplementary Fig. 5b, e, f ). Overall, these awake and anesthetized urinary recordings indicate that stimulation of both Bar populations equally increase bladder pressure, but only Bar ESR1 neurons relax the EUS via bursting to enable efficient urine flow as in natural, awake urination in male mice. Bar ESR1 but not Bar CRH neurons are indispensable for voluntary scent marking urination No single cell type in Bar has been shown to be necessary for voluntary urination. To investigate the extent to which Bar neurons participate in this motivated behavior, we established a rapid behavioral assay that compares the voluntary baseline urination rate (two minutes in the presence of a control odor) to the rate during the subsequent two minutes, in the presence of motivating female urine odor (Fig. 6 ; Suppl. Video 6). The reliable and rapid change in the amount of urine marks in response to female urine indicates that olfactory cues access circuits which relax the EUS and generate voluntary urination. To test if Bar neurons are necessary for this response, we bilaterally infected them with AAV-FLEX-hM4Di in ESR1-Cre or CRH-Cre mice (Bar  or Bar  ; Fig. 7a-b ). Individuals were then injected with either CNO or saline on alternate days and assayed for their urination rate in the presence of female urine. Female-odor evoked urination was reversibly diminished following CNO injections in Bar ESR1-hM4Di but not Bar  or wild-type control mice (Fig. 7d-e ), despite higher viral infection levels in CRH-Cre mice (Fig. 7c ), and without affecting locomotion or odor sampling (Supplementary Fig. 7a-b ). A previous study found a subtle effect on urination from Bar CRH-hM4Di inhibition at a much longer 2-hour timescale 15 , which we replicated here (Supplementary Fig. 7c ) and is consistent with a modulatory role for either Bar CRH or the third population of Bar CRH+ESR1 neurons that would be expected to be inhibited with both drivers. We additionally examined the necessity of Bar ESR1 neurons at faster timescales by bilaterally injecting them with AAV-FLEX-ArchT (Bar ESR1-ArchT mice; Fig. 7f ; Supplementary Fig. 8a ). We compared urination during 2 minutes of photoinhibition with female odor present to an additional 2 minutes immediately after photoinhibition ceased (Fig. 7g ). Sniffing of the female odor did not differ during and after photoinhibition, but urination was largely inhibited during the photoinhibition window (Fig. 7h-j , Supplementary Fig. 8b ; Suppl. Video 7). Most trials with female odor, but not with control odor, resulted in urination within seconds of light termination. This suggests that the immediate urine release resulted from priming by odor cues rather than trivial rebound activity upon the cessation of photoinhibition (Fig. 7g-h ; Supplementary Fig. 8c ). Finally, photoinhibition during cystometry revealed that ongoing Bar ESR1 activity is necessary to maintain sphincter bursting, since initiating brief photoinhibition during a reflexive urination event terminated EUS bursting activity and urine release within milliseconds (Supplementary Fig. 8d-e ). Together, our experiments indicate that Bar ESR1 neurons are essential for urethral inhibition (relaxation) and voluntary urination promoted by olfactory cues in male mice. Discussion Bar is well established to be the key conserved brainstem node that coordinates the switch from urine storage to elimination. It is currently modeled as a single projection to the spinal cord that diverges to coordinate both the smooth, involuntary, slow muscle of the bladder wall and the voluntary, striated, fast muscle of the external urethral sphincter (EUS). However, neurons that relax the EUS have not previously been identified, at least in part because voluntary urination is difficult to trigger and study in model organisms. Here we leveraged the natural behavior of male mice, which are highly motivated to scent mark their territory in environments likely to contain females, irrespective of bladder pressure. Our quantitative behavioral assay allowed us to identify and study a novel subpopulation of Bar neurons that are critical to achieve voluntary urination. We further show that optogenetic stimulation of these Bar ESR1 neurons in male mice under isoflurane anesthesia can be used as a powerful model of controlled urination. The surprising ability of this minority subset of Bar neurons to drive robust urination comes not from the induced bladder pressure increase, but their unique ability to relax the EUS and gate urine release. It will be of great interest to determine if the function of the Bar ESR1 neurons is conserved across evolution since ESR1 expression has also been described in Bar of primates, and human urination similarly depends upon relaxing the urethral sphincter 22, 23 . Our findings in mice suggest an updated model of supraspinal urinary control in which Bar sends molecularly and functionally distinct parallel projections to downstream urinary targets (Supplementary Fig. 9a ), with Bar ESR1 neurons serving as a key novel subset to enable the study of neural mechanisms underlying voluntary urination. The majority of neurons in Bar express CRH, yet their anatomy and optogenetic activation indicates a role in focal bladder contraction without relaxing the urethral sphincter. Moreover, chemogenetic inhibition of Bar CRH neurons does not reveal an essential role for this subset of neurons in generating odor-evoked voluntary urination. However, Bar CRH cells have been reported to play a role in urination patterns regulated by long-term social status changes, while CRH itself has a negative effect on urination at longer timescales 20, 2, 15 . In agreement with these findings, we replicated an earlier finding that inhibition of Bar CRH neurons leads to a modest decrease in urine marks over a much longer two hour assay (Supplementary Fig. 7c ) 15 . Additionally, Bar CRH neurons have been proposed to map onto the "direct" subset of Bar neurons whose firing rates correlate directly with reflexive bladder contraction 15 , and which some have suggested function to prolong the contraction and maintain appropriate pressure rather than initiate urination 14 . The activity of about onefourth of Bar neurons does not correlate with reflexive bladder activity at all 14 , and our results suggest that urethral inhibition provides another meaningful dimension to Bar categorization. However, a more complete and dynamic catalog of gene expression and spiking activity in Bar neurons during a variety of conditions will likely be needed to fully classify their roles. Liquid waste elimination is a fundamental animal need, but it must compete with many other potential priorities in a complicated world. These behavioral interactions could explain the need for heterogeneous urination control at the brainstem level, as demonstrated by the actions of Bar ESR1 and Bar CRH neurons described here. For example, scent marking to conspecific odor cues is highly sexually dimorphic, but all adult mice additionally urinate under extreme stress 2 , analogous to stress incontinence in humans. Mice will also mark more in novel environments 39 , and it is well known that urination is modulated by circadian rhythms and fluid homeostasis [40] [41] [42] . Finally, control of urination is under complex developmental regulation in rodents, whereby maternal anogenital licking is required in early postnatal life to induce reflex urination and defecation, but this response is later replaced by supraspinal reflexes and even later by voluntary control 1, 43 . All of these complications are likely to manifest at one or more levels of the brain, and the separability of Bar subtypes could serve to decouple the actions of bladder and urethra to enable more options for complex control of urination behavior relative to brain state and environment. Beyond urination, Bar is also implicated in a wider range of pelvic functions (implying that the term "pontine micturition center" is a misnomer 13 ) and has recently been termed the 'pelvic organ stimulating center' by anatomical and correlational evidence for roles in behaviors such as defecation, sexual behavior, and childbirth, which require varying levels of somatic (e.g. Bar ESR1 ) and autonomic (e.g. Bar CRH ) coordination of the pelvic floor 3, 44 (Supplementary Fig. 9b ). This multifunctional view of Bar perhaps provides the most parsimonious explanation for molecular, cellular, and physiological heterogeneity in this relatively small nucleus. For example, ejaculation requires striated urethral muscles for semen expulsion, but simultaneous bladder inhibition and backflow prevention 1, 45 , and likely uses the same pattern generator in the L3-L4 DGC proposed to drive bursting urination in rodents 30 . The current data shows that Bar ESR1 neurons provide input to the DGC at these rostral lumbar levels (Supplementary Fig. 2c ) that could drive the expulsion phase of ejaculation, whilst bladder pressure could be independently inhibited. Furthermore, the idea of regulation at different timescales could extend to other pelvic autonomic functions such as pheromone release from the preputial gland, which is also known to be regulated by social status 46 and needs to be synchronized with the urine stream. Other slow functions attributed to the pelvic ganglia, but for which little is known in the central nervous system 47 , include sperm production and transport, prostate gland secretions, and various reproductive secretions that differ by species 48, 49 . Thus, while the role of Bar ESR1 neurons in voluntary urination is clear, our demonstration of functional heterogeneity across Bar invites further study into potential roles for all its neurons in regulating various other pelvic functions. Incontinence directly or indirectly affects nearly everyone at some point in their life, yet we still have relatively little understanding of how the brain functions or fails to function during this process. Common disruptions include detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in paraplegics or after spinal cord injury 1 , pudendal nerve damage during childbirth, stress urinary incontinence, Fowler's syndrome (inability to voluntarily relax the EUS in women 50 ), paruresis (inability to urinate in public), and nocturnal enuresis or bedwetting. Bar ESR1 neurons can now serve as an important new target for greater understanding of cause and effect in these disorders. Furthermore, the ability to direct voluntary urination in behaving male mice on a timescale of seconds also opens up new avenues to record and manipulate neural activity during natural urination that is not driven by bladder distension. Bar ESR1 neurons form a critical node in this relatively simple and robust social behavior that can be leveraged to rigorously ask how such behavior is modulated by age, sex, state, and learning. Online Methods Animals All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Scripps Research Institute. Mice were group housed at weaning (<5 per cage), single housed for at least 1 week before any testing, and maintained on a 12/12hr light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. All mice were males with a mean age of ~10 weeks when single housed (range 8-12 weeks), and a mean weight of ~27g (range 25-33g). The number of mice used for each experiment is listed below where applicable and in the figure legends. All mouse lines are available at The Jackson Laboratory: CRH-Cre 51 (stock #: 012704), ESR1-Cre 52 (stock #: 017911), Vgat-Cre (stock #: 016962), Vglut2-Cre (stock #: 016963), ROSA-LSL-tdTomato (Ai9, stock #: 007909), ROSA-LSL-ZsGreen (Ai6, stock #: 007906), and BALB/cByJ (stock #: 000651). CRH-Cre and ESR1-Cre mice were backcrossed into the BALB/cByJ background for 3+ generations. General surgical procedures Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 1-2% maintenance, Kent Scientific SomnoSuite) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments Model 962). Ophthalmic ointment (Puralube) was applied, buprenorphine (Buprenex, 0.15mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly at the beginning of the procedure, and 500uL sterile saline containing carprofen (Rimadyl, 5mg/kg) and enrofloxacin (Baytril, 5mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously at the end of the procedure. Mice were monitored daily and given at least 14 days for recovery and viral expression before subsequent behavioral testing. AAV viral vectors For photostimulation, AAV9-CAG-FLEX-ChR2-tdTomato (UPenn AV-9-18917P) was injected bilaterally at 1.4×10 12 GC/mL in both ESR1-Cre and CRH-Cre animals. For CRH-Cre animals only, we also included AAV1-EF1α-FLEX-hChR2-eYFP (1:1 mix with above, UPenn AV-1-20298P) since this virus expressed at higher levels in Bar CRH neurons in preliminary experiments. For photostimulation controls, AAV9-CAG-FLEX-GFP (UNC AV5220) was injected bilaterally at 3.2×10 13 GC/mL in ESR1-Cre mice. For ESR1-Cre DREADD inhibition 53 , AAVdj-CAG-FLEX-hM4Di-GFP 54 (Addgene plasmid # 52536, a gift from Scott Sternson) was produced by the Salk Institute Gene Transfer Targeting and Therapeutics Core (GT3) and injected bilaterally at 8×10 12 GC/mL. We did not see efficient expression using this virus in CRH-Cre animals, so for CRH-Cre DREADD inhibition, AAVdj/1-EF1α-FLEX-hM4Di-mCherry (Addgene plasmid # 50461, a gift from Bryan Roth) was produced by Virovek and injected bilaterally at 4×10 12 GC/mL. For photoinhibition, AAV9-CAG-FLEX-ArchT-GFP (UNC AV6222) was injected bilaterally at 2.2×10 12 GC/mL in ESR1-Cre animals, and the same virus and titer were used for anatomical axon tracing unilaterally in both ESR1-Cre and CRH-Cre animals. For fiber photometry, AAV-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6s 55 (UPenn AV-9-PV2818) was unilaterally injected at 3.2×10 12 GC/mL in ESR1-Cre animals. Viral injection and fiber optic implantation Injections were made using pulled glass pipettes (tips broken for ID = 10-20μm) and a Picospritzer at 25 -75 nL/min. For Bar injections, the overlying muscle was removed and a medial-lateral angle of 33° was used to avoid the 4 th ventricle. The pipette entry coordinate relative to bregma was 5.3mm caudal, 2.5mm lateral, and 3.2mm diagonally below the dura. The surrounding skull area was thinned for visualization with a diamond drill bit and the rostral-caudal coordinate was adjusted if necessary to coincide with the junction of the inferior colliculus and cerebellum, and to avoid hitting the transverse sinus. AAVs were injected 30-150nL per side, and the pipette was left in place for 5 min after injection, before slowly retracting. Fiber optic implants (4 mm length, Plexon 230μm diameter for ChR2/ ArchT and Doric 400μm diameter for GCaMP) were inserted along the pipette track as above, 300μm above the injection site for ChR2/ArchT, and 50μm for GCaMP. Additionally, two anchor screws (Antrin Miniature Specialties M1 X .060″) were attached over frontal cortex for animals with implants. After injection/implantation, the skull was covered with superglue and dental cement to seal the craniotomy and hold the implants in place. Spinal cord CTB injection A 1-2 cm incision was made over lumbar segments, and the connective tissue and muscle overlying the vertebrae was minimally dissected 56 to expose L1 and L2 vertebrae 57 . Vertebrae and underlying spinal segments were located by spinous process tendon attachments and spinous process shape, and confirmed by pilot injections of DiD dye. A spinal adapter 56 for the stereotaxic frame (Stoelting 51690) was used to clamp L2 transverse processes, and a beveled glass pipette was lowered into the space between L1 and L2 vertebrae, 400μm lateral to the spinous process midline and 600μm below dura, to target the sacral mediolateral column bladder preganglionic neurons. After injection of 150 nL CTB-488 (ThermoFisher, 0.5% in PBS), the pipette was left in place for 5 min before slowly retracting, and then the injection site was covered with gelfoam and the overlying skin was sutured. Survival time was 5 days. Odor-motivated urination assay Sexually naïve male mice were briefly prescreened for urination responses to 100uL female urine (>1 second odor sampling period with >3 urine marks within 1 minute) before any further testing or manipulation, which excluded 21% of all mice tested. The remaining 79% had surgical procedures and recovery or a 2 week waiting period before starting habituation. Mice were habituated in the behavior room for 3 consecutive days, for 16/8/4 minute durations on days 1/2/3. On day 3, control stimuli (100uL tonic water, which fluoresces under UV illumination) were pipetted from above at 0 min. and 2 min. and the baseline response was recorded. On subsequent test days, a 4 min. assay was used, with 100uL tonic water delivered at 0 minutes and 100uL female urine delivered at 2 min. All behavior was conducted during light hours under dim red light, and 70% ethanol was used to clean equipment between trials. The recording box consisted of a UV-opaque acryllic homecage with the bottom cut out, placed on top of 0.35mm chromatography paper (Fisher Scientific 05-714-4) resting on clear glass (Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Two wide angle cameras (Logitech C930e), one above on a modified cage top, and one below the bottom glass, streamed video to a laptop computer at 15 frames per second, 640×360 pixel resolution. An analog pulse controlled LEDs in each camera field of view in order to synchronize cameras. Two UV fluorescent tube lights (American DJ Black-24BLB) surrounded by foil walls were used to evenly illuminate the chromatography paper from below. Videos were cut using Adobe After Effects and subsequently analyzed for urine marks using custom MATLAB software. The red and green channels of the RGB camera frames were used for urine detection, and the blue channel for mouse tracking. An output video with urine detection overlay was generated to manually verify automatic spot detection. Noldus Ethovision XT was used to automatically track mice and determine distance traveled and odor sniffing periods, defined as when the nosepoint occluded the female urine stimulus. Female urine collection Adult (8-16 weeks) C57BL/6N female mice were housed 5 per cage, soiled male bedding was introduced into the cage 24 hours before the first collection night to induce estrous, and urine was pooled from 4 cages (20 mice total) over 4 days such that the stimulus consisted of a mix from all stages of the estrous cycle 58 . The mice were placed in metabolic cage for 12-16 hours at a time overnight, and urine was collected directly into a sterile tube on dry ice 59 and temporarily stored at -20°C in the morning. After 4 consecutive nights of collection, urine was thawed on ice, rapidly passed through a 0.22μm filter (Millipore Steriflip SCGP00525) before aliquoting and storing at -80°C. Two different batches of urine were collected for all experiments, and each was used with both control and experimental groups. Chemogenetic inhibition After hM4Di 53 viral injection, mice were allowed at least 21 days for recovery and expression, and then intraperitoneally injected 45-55 minutes before testing with either control saline plus 0.5% DMSO, or Clozapine N-oxide (CNO, 5mg/kg, Enzo Life Sciences BML-NS105-0025) in saline plus 0.5% DMSO. Control saline injections were performed on the 3 habituation days before female urine was given. Then on days 4/5/6/7, mice received CNO/saline/CNO/saline before the female urine countermarking assay described above. CRH-Cre mice were tested for 2 additional days (CNO, then saline) using the same assay but with 2-hour duration. Mice with less than 3 marks within 2 minutes after stimulus on both saline control days were excluded from analysis (8 of 34 mice), as well as mice that did not have bilateral hM4Di expression that spanned at least ±100μm from the Bar rostralcaudal center, defined by ovoid Nissl clustering medial to locus coeruleus (7 of 34 mice). The "CNO Urine Inhibition Index" (CUI) was calculated as [(fraction max. urine marks on saline days) -(fraction max. urine marks on CNO days)], such that CUI = 2 represents complete inhibition by CNO relative to saline, while CUI = 0 represents no difference between saline and CNO days. Optogenetic stimulation For photostimulation experiments, fiber-implanted mice were briefly anesthetized with 5 % isoflurane before connecting and disconnecting patch cables (Plexon 0.5m, 230μm diameter). An LED current source (Mightex BLS-SA02-US) driving two 465nm PlexBright Compact LED Modules (Plexon) through a Dual LED Commutator (Plexon) provided 10±1 mW exiting the fiber tips. Optical power was measured (ThorLabs PM20A) before and after each session. Mice were placed in the same recording box described above for behavior, but with thinner 0.19 mm chromatography paper (Fisher Scientific 05-714-1). Initial experiments with different pulse widths determined 15 msec to be more effective than 5 msec or 1 msec at driving urination responses. All photostimulation bouts occurred for 5 sec duration using 15 msec pulses at five different frequencies: 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50Hz. These frequencies were stimulated in increasing order on the first day, and then repeated in decreasing order on the second day. At least 1 min elapsed between different photostimulation bouts, with additional delays occasionally necessary to allow the mouse to move to a clean section of paper. Videos were cut using Adobe After Effects (version CS5) and subsequently analyzed for urine marks using custom MATLAB software (version 2014b). Urine amount was calculated from urinated pixels detected using second-order polynomial coefficients determined with MATLAB polyfit on male urine calibration data (Supplementary Fig. 3c-d ). Response latency was calculated as the earliest point when the normalized Δurine derivative reached 10% of maximum during the 15 sec response period. For a subset of mice, we repeated photostimulation on a third day under 1.5% maintenance isoflurane anesthesia. Four anesthetized 50 Hz/15 msec/5 sec photostimulation bouts separated by 1 min/1 min/1 min/5 min were conducted, then the isoflurane was removed and the mouse was allowed to recover to walking before waiting 5 min and following with two awake 50 Hz/15 msec/5 sec bouts separated by 1 min/5 min to confirm that awake urination was intact. After all experiments, mice were perfused and checked for viral expression and fiber placement as described for immunohistochemistry. Mice that did not have at least unilateral ChR2 expression that spanned ±100μm from the Bar rostral-caudal center were excluded from analysis (9 of 29 mice). Optogenetic inhibition For photoinhibition, all procedures were same as for photostimulation described above except for the following changes: fiber implanted mice were not anesthetized before connecting patch cables, but were habituated to the procedure for at least 3 days before testing. On the final habituation day, control odor was presented and 3 different photoinhibition periods were applied (2x 30 sec., 1x 2 min., separated by at least 30 seconds) to test the baseline effects of ArchT inhibition on urine output. Plexon 550 nm PlexBright Compact LED Modules were used, providing provided 6±1 mW exiting the fiber tips. During odor-motivated urination assay as described above, 2 min. of constant photoinhibition was applied 105 seconds after control odor, and 10-15 seconds before female urine. Urine marking behavior continued for 2 min. after photoinhibition ceased. Mice that did not have bilateral ArchT expression that spanned ±100μm from the Bar rostral-caudal center were excluded from analysis (7 of 10 mice). Fiber photometry Bulk GCaMP fluorescence was collected at 20 Hz using a similar setup to that previously described 60 . ΔF/F was calculated as (F -median(F)/median(F)) for each trial. An analog pulse controlled LEDs in each camera field of view as well as an Arduino sending triggers to the sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4), in order to synchronize video and GCaMP data streams. Mice were recorded for 8 min. total (4 min. control odor only, then 4 min. with female urine stimulus). Δurine peaks were calculated from bottom video (MATLAB findpeaks function) with a minimum peak of 0.18 μL/frame, and GCaMP traces were analyzed around these peaks (zero lag) or at randomly selected times within the same assay (shuffle lag) as a control. The MATLAB corrcoef function was used to calculate correlation between GCaMP and Δurine traces. Electromyography and cystometry Fiber-implanted mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance) and the bladder and external urethral sphincter (EUS, or urethral rhabdosphincter) 61, 62 were exposed via ~1cm midline abdominal incision. Flanged PE20 tubing connected to a syringe pump and pressure sensor (Biopac Systems DA100C/TSD104A) using a 25G needle was inserted and sutured into the bladder dome. Two tungsten wires (A-M Systems 795500) were stripped of insulation 1-2mm at the ends and inserted bilaterally (~2mm separation) into the EUS just proximal to the pubic symphysis, using a 30G needle. A third ground wire was stripped 3-4mm at the end and placed subcutaneously. The abdominal incision was sutured, allowing the tubing and wires to exit and connect to a differential amplifier (Biopac Systems EMG100C: gain = 5000, sample rate = 10kHz, low pass filter = 5kHz, 60Hz notch filter and 100Hz high pass filter). A digital input was simultaneously acquired at 10kHz, which was controlled by a TTL switch that also triggered optogenetic stimulation. After suturing, isoflurane was reduced to 1.0-1.8% (minimal to eliminate movement artifacts) and the bladder was filled at 10-20μL/min for at least 45 min. before starting photostimulation. Once a regular rhythm of urination cycles was established, the volume threshold was calculated as the mean volume of 3 cycles, and "filled" and "empty" states were defined as 75% and 10% of this mean value. Only mice with natural bursting cycles were analyzed for photostimulated or photoinhibited responses. Photostimulation consisted of 50 Hz/15 msec/5 sec photostimulation bouts separated by > 1 min. Photoinhibition consisted of constant illumination for 2 or 5 seconds, manually triggered at the beginning of a burst event. Rootmean-square (RMS) EMG traces were calculated using a 300 msec Gaussian filter and subtraction of the mean across 5 seconds prior to photostimulation. Sphincter relaxation periods were defined using RMS EMG data as periods between peaks >0.1mV (MATLAB findpeaks function) with amplitude less than the mean value prior to photostimulation. Frequency content of RMS EMG traces was calculated by first downsampling to 200 Hz, and then taking the FFT in overlapping 2 sec. rectangular windows. The spectrogram was thresholded at -40dB and burst duration was calculated as the time in which mean power in the 5-15Hz band is above this threshold. Wireless corpus spongiosum recording Wireless pressure sensors (Data Sciences International, DSI PA-C10) were sterilized and implanted in the bulb of the corpus spongiosum that surrounds the urethra as previously described 38, 63, 64 , with the transmitter placed subcutaneously in the lateral abdominal area. After 1 week recovery, mice were recorded in the odor-motivated urine assay as described above, but with a single camera and UV illumination from above and the DSI RPC-1 receiver below the test cage. Pressure data was logged at 500 Hz and synchronized to urine imaging video. Frequency content of pressure traces was calculated by taking the FFT in overlapping 2 sec. hamming windows. Slice electrophysiology Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, and acute 300μm coronal brain sections were prepared after intracardial perfusion of ice-cold choline-based slicing solution containing (in mM): 25 NaHCO 3 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl 2 , 25 glucose, 0.5 CaCl 2 , 110 choline chloride, 11.6 sodium ascorbate, 3.1 sodium pyruvate). Brains were quickly transferred and sliced in the same solution with a vibratome (LeicaVT1200). Sections were transferred to a recovery chamber and incubated for 15-20 min at 35 °C in recovery solution consisting of (in mM): 118 NaCl, 2.6 NaHCO 3 , 11 glucose, 15 HEPES, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 sodium pyruvate, 0.4 sodium ascorbate, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2. Slices were maintained at room temperature for at least 30 min until transferred to bath for recording. Cutting solution, recovery solution, and ACSF were constantly bubbled with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . Slices were transferred to a recording chamber on an upright fluorescent microscope continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF (in mM):125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO 3 , 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 11 glucose, 1.3 MgCl 2 and 2.5 CaCl 2 at 28-31 °C using a feedback temperature controller. Neurons labeled by fluorescent markers were visualized with a 40X water-immersion objective with epifluorescence and infrared differential interference contrast video microscopy. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (G150TF-4; Warner Instruments) with 3-5 MΩ resistance. The internal solution for current-clamp recording consisted of the following (in mM): 125 potassium D-gluconate, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 20 KCl, 4 Mg 2 -ATP, 0.3 Na 3 -GTP, and 10 phosphocreatine. Recordings were made using a MultiClamp700B amplifier and pClamp software (Molecular Devices). The signal was low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz with a digitizer (Molecular Devices). For photostimulation of ChR2, 15 ms/5 sec duration blue light pulses were emitted from a collimated light-emitting diode (473 nm; Thorlabs) driven by a T-Cube LED Driver (Thorlabs) under the control of a Digidata 1440A Data Acquisition System and pClamp software. Light was delivered through the reflected light fluorescence illuminator port and the 40X objective (light power at max setting measured at 13.45 mW). Analysis was performed in either Clampfit (Molecular Devices) or OriginPro 2016 (Origin Lab). Immunostaining Animals were perfused with cold PBS followed by 4% PFA, and the brain/spinal cord (SC) was dissected and postfixed in 4% PFA at 4°C for 24-48 hours. The brain/SC was then washed in PBS and embedded in 1% low melting point agarose and cut on a vibratome at 50μm for ESR1 staining or 100μm for Nissl-only staining. Spinal cords were cut transversely across the entire thoracolumbar and lumbosacral region and matched to segments using Nissl landmarks. For ESR1 immunostaining, free-floating sections were blocked in 1% BSA (Sigma A3059) in 1% PBST (PBS plus Triton X-100) for 3 hours, followed by primary incubation with anti-ESR1 antibody 17, 52, 65 (antigen is mouse Cterminus fragment; Santa Cruz sc-542, rabbit polyclonal, 100μg/mL diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA/0.3% PBST) overnight at room temperature. Sections were washed 3X with 0.1% PBST and blocked again at room temperature for 1 hour, before incubating in secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Alexa-Fluor 488 or 647 anti-rabbit IgG H+L diluted 1:2000 in 1% BSA/0.3% PBST) at room temperature for 3 hours. Nissl stain (ThermoFisher NeuroTrace Blue or Deep Red diluted 1:200) was also included here if necessary, or incubated for 2 hours in 0.3% PBST if used alone. Sections were washed 2X in 0.1% PBST followed by 2X PBS, then mounted with ProLong Diamond (ThermoFisher). Fluorescent in situ hybridization Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane before rapid brain extraction, embedding in OCT, and freezing on dry ice. Coronal sections were cut at 20μm and stored at -80°C until processing according to the protocol provided in the RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent v2 kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Sections were fixed in 4% PFA, dehydrated, and hybridized with mixed probes: Crh (Mm-crh, Cat. 316091), Esr1 (Mm-Esr1-O2-C2, a 16ZZ probe targeting 1308-2125 of NM_007956.5.), Slc32a1 (Vgat, Mm-Slc32a1, Cat. 319191), and Slc17a6 (Vglut2, Mm-Slc17a6-C2, Cat. 319171) for 2h at 40°C and followed by amplification. Signal in each channel is developed using TSA Cyanine 3, fluorescein, and Cyanine 5 (PerkinElmer) individually. Sections were counterstained with DAPI and mounted with ProLong Diamond. Confocal Microscopy Images were captured with Nikon A1 Confocal Microscope with a 10x air, 20x air or 40x oil objective. Nikon Elements software settings were optimized for each experiment to maximize signal range, and z-stack maximum projections were used for representative images and axonal projections while single optical slices were used for quantification of cell body overlap. For RNAScope, z-stacks were collected in 1μm increments throughout the zaxis. Anatomical quantification The rostrocaudal center of Bar was defined as two consecutive 50μm section with greatest ESR1 and CRH-tdT labelling whenever possible, or by distinctive ovoid Nissl boundaries. Custom MATLAB scripts were used to draw ROIs around Bar and semi-automatically count cells with clear cell body staining. Cells with high expression of ESR1 were distinguished from background labeling by thresholding in the ESR1 color channel just below the mean intensity level of nearby parabrachial neurons with established strong ESR1 expression 29, 66 . Cartesian coordinates for cell locations were saved and the centroid of CRH-tdT cells was used to register different sections to generate the overlay plot in Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 9 . For calculation of fluorescence intensity ratio (Fig. 1k ) in the lumbosacral mediolateral column (ML) and dorsal grey commissure (DGC), all intact L5-S2 sections with visible axons were used. A rectangular ROI was drawn using the Nissl color channel to encapsulate the MLs and area in between. This ROI was then equally divided into mediallateral thirds and the Bar axon color channel was used to calculate the sum of pixel intensity across each third. The ratio was calculated as this total pixel intensity in the middle DGC third divided by that of the 2 ML thirds averaged together. Statistics and reproducibility Nonparametric tests were used for all experiments, as detailed in the figure legends, which do not make assumptions about data distributions or variances. The Wilcoxon signed rank test (MATLAB signrank) was used for comparison of 2 paired groups, and the Mann-Whitney U test (aka. Wilcoxon rank sum test; MATLAB ranksum) for 2 unpaired groups. Friedman's test (MATLAB friedman) was used to compare across CNO and saline treatments for 4-day DREADD experiments, followed by Dunn-Sidak posthoc tests (MATLAB multcompare). Points with error bars represent mean ± s.e.m. For most experiments, no statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications [52] [53] [54] . We used the effect size from preliminary wild-type chemogenetic experiments to calculate sample sizes for ESR1-Cre and CRH-Cre chemogenetic experiments (Fig. 7d-e ), using the sampsizepwr function in MATLAB. For each experiment, animals were maintained under identical conditions, such that no randomization was used to assign groups. Data collection and analysis were generally not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. However, automated data analysis in MATLAB and Ethovision was used to track animal behavior such that no blinding is necessary to ensure behavioral data integrity. Semi-automated analyses similarly assisted cell counting, where the Nissl channel was used to manually define the Bar region-of-interest, rather than the cell-counting channel. In Fig. 1b-c , Bar sections from n=6 mice were imaged, shown together in Fig. 1d-f . In Fig. 1g-I , injection sites and lumbosacral spinal cords from n=5 unitateral AAV-FLEX-GFP injection animals and n=5 bilateral AAV-FLEX-ChR2 animals were used (10 total each, for ESR1-Cre and CRH-Cre lines) with similar results to calculate the total summary in Fig. 1l .

How, why, and when consciousness evolved remain hotly debated topics. Addressing these issues requires considering the distribution of consciousness across the animal phylogenetic tree. Here we propose that at least one invertebrate clade, the insects, has a capacity for the most basic aspect of consciousness: subjective experience. In vertebrates the capacity for subjective experience is supported by integrated structures in the midbrain that create a neural simulation of the state of the mobile animal in space. This integrated and egocentric representation of the world from the animal's perspective is sufficient for subjective experience. Structures in the insect brain perform analogous functions. Therefore, we argue the insect brain also supports a capacity for subjective experience. In both vertebrates and insects this form of behavioral control system evolved as an efficient solution to basic problems of sensory reafference and true navigation. The brain structures that support subjective experience in vertebrates and insects are very different from each other, but in both cases they are basal to each clade. Hence we propose the origins of subjective experience can be traced to the Cambrian. subjective experience | primary consciousness | vertebrate midbrain | central complex Consciousness is marked by the presence of subjective experience: In the philosopher's term of art, there is "something it is like" for us to be aware of the world (1) . Neurotypical adult humans are obviously conscious. So are young human children, although we recognize that the nature of consciousness in children is different from that of adults and changes rapidly as children develop. Plausibly, some animals also have the capacity for some forms of consciousness-at least, it certainly seems odd to insist that the inner life of a chimp goes on entirely in the dark. However, consciousness also gives out somewhere. Plants do not have it. It would be surprising if jellyfish did. Where to draw the line between what is conscious and what is not, and how to justify drawing that line, remain hotly debated questions. These debates are especially difficult when it comes to assessing potential consciousness in invertebrates. Methodological challenges are partly to blame. The three most common methods of studying consciousness in humans-verbal report, behavioral demonstrations, and neural correlation with conscious activity-generalize poorly to invertebrate models. Nonhuman animals cannot give verbal reports about what they are experiencing. There have been attempts to deploy to animals behavioral paradigms that are considered evidence of conscious processing when successfully performed by humans (2) (3) (4) . This introduces a strong bias toward anthropomorphic performance by animals. As skeptics are quick to note, we have no guarantee that animals that behave like humans do so because they have the same subjective experiences that humans do. (Indeed, establishing this is precisely the issue.) Further, the bias toward clever animals is itself distorting. Many invertebrates live comparatively simple lives, without complex forms of communication and social behavior. If one cares about the basic capacity for consciousness and where it came from, one should be prepared to accept that the origins of consciousness may lie in animals that do only very boring, unclever things. The search for the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) (5) is often framed as avoiding the pitfalls of purely behavioral research. NCC research focuses on the contents of particular conscious experiences, rather than the overall capacity for subjective experience (6) . NCCs may thus be a poor guide to the more basic shared capacity to have any conscious experiences at all. In practice, NCC work also tends toward the anthropocentric, and the best paradigms are still difficult to extend to invertebrates. NCC results thus tend to be biased toward complex cortical structures and cannot generalize to animals lacking a cortex. In this review, we will suggest an alternative approach to studying the capacity for subjective experience in invertebrates. Neuroethological approaches have made great advances in determining how neurobiological mechanisms within the insect brain generate adaptive behavior. We argue that knowledge of these mechanisms can ground an evidence-based inquiry into the capacity for consciousness in insects. We begin our argument by discussing the basic features of the simplest forms of consciousness, the capacity to have subjective experience (7) . We then consider structures that support the capacity for subjective experience in humans. Following Bjorn Merker (8, 9) , we argue that the human midbrain subserves the basic capacity for subjective experience. It does so in virtue of producing an integrated simulation of the state of the animal's own mobile body within the environment. We then argue that the insect brain performs similar functions, even though the anatomy of the insect brain is very different from that of vertebrates. Insects have specialized brain structures that solve the same basic problems by producing the same kind of unified model. We therefore conclude that if subjective experience is indeed supported by midbrain structures in humans, then insects also have the capacity for a form of subjective experience. Finally, we propose that a capacity for subjective experience probably evolved early in the history of animal life for specific animal clades. We thus suggest that the study of insects gives a unique comparative perspective on the mechanisms and evolution of consciousness. Subjective Experience and the Vertebrate Midbrain Behavioral researchers have realized the need to distinguish different levels of consciousness. There are many classifications (7) , but each posits a basic form of consciousness that consists of a direct awareness of the world without further reflection upon that awareness. This basic level has been termed primary consciousness (10) , core consciousness (11, 12) , phenomenal consciousness (13) , or "I" consciousness (14) . The defining feature of this most basic level of consciousness is the appearance of the capacity for subjective experience. Humans are capable of more complex forms of consciousness. We can reflect upon our own mental states, for example, which is why verbal reports are so valuable. The levels corresponding to these higher capacities are variously termed self-reflexive consciousness (7) , access consciousness (13), higher-order awareness (10) , or "me" consciousness (14) . These higher forms of consciousness require more than the mere capacity for subjective experience: the ability to represent one's own subjective experience to oneself, awareness of oneself as a self, the possession of the concept of experience, or full linguistic capability. We mention these more complex levels of consciousness to bracket them off. It is contentious whether any other higher vertebrates possess them; we think it exceedingly unlikely that any invertebrates do. Our argument thus concerns only whether insects have subjective experience. Because subjective experience is a simpler phenomenon than self-reflexive consciousness, one might reasonably expect it to be more widespread in the animal kingdom, and evolutionarily older. There is now considerable evidence that, in humans, subjective experience can exist in the absence of self-reflexive consciousness, and that the two are supported by different neural structures. Midbrain structures, rather than cortex, seem to be especially important. Merker (8, 9) , Parvisi and Damasio (11) , Damasio and Carvalho (15) , and Mashour and Alkire (16) have all argued that the integrated structures of the vertebrate midbrain are sufficient to support the capacity for subjective experience. Merker (8) notes that subjective experience is remarkably sensitive to damage to midbrain structures. Conversely, there is evidence of preserved consciousness even in patients who lack a cortex (9) . Further, although cortical damage can have profound effects on the contents of consciousness, damage to any portion of the cortex alone can spare the basic capacity for subjective experience (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Cortical damage alone can have profound effects on the contents of consciousness, but even massive cortical damage seems to spare subjective experience itself (8, 17, 18) . Indeed, there is evidence of residual conscious awareness in patients with severe cortical damage who are otherwise unresponsive to the world, suggesting that preserved subcortical structures may continue to support subjective experience (23, 24) . Although the mechanism of anesthetic action is still debated (25) , there is increasing evidence that the effect of anesthetics depends on the disconnection of cortical circuits from subcortical structures rather than on their direct cortical activity (26, 27) . Anesthetics (28) or electrical stimulation (19) , which affect cortical midline structures without affecting subcortical structures, do not abolish consciousness; they instead produce unresponsive but conscious dreamlike states. Conversely, emergence from anesthesia (16, 29) and coma/vegetative state (30) are predicted by the reengagement of subcortical structures and reintegration of those structures with cortical circuits. Other authors have noted the powerful subcortical effect of drugs, endogenous peptides, and direct stimulation on primitive motivational states (12, 16, 31) . In sum, there is good evidence that subcortical structures underlie the basic capacity for subjective experience in humans. This is not to say that the cortex is unimportant for conscious experience, of course. Rather, the proposal is that subcortical structures support the basic capacity for experience, the detailed contents of which might be elaborated by or otherwise depend upon cortical structures (32) . How the Vertebrate Midbrain Supports the Capacity for Subjective Experience We will adopt and expand the account given by Merker (8) , who argues that subjective experience arises from interacting midbrain and basal ganglia structures creating an integrated simulation of the state of the animal's own mobile body within the environment. Merker suggests that an important function of the midbrain is to combine interoceptive (stimuli arising from within the body) and exteroceptive (stimuli external to the body) sensory information. Information on the environment, and the location and movement of the animal within it, is processed within the roof of the midbrain (the tectum, or colliculus in mammals). Information about homeostatic needs is processed within the floor of the midbrain (the hypothalamus and associated structures). Nuclei located between these poles integrate this information to produce a unified multimodal neural model of the spatial location of resources relative to the animal, which is coupled to, and weighted by, the extent to which different resources are needed by the animal (8) (Fig. 1A ). Vertebrates organize their behavior by reference to this integrated model of the environment rather than by reacting to independent sensory inputs (8, 33) . In mammals the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) receive topographically organized visual inputs (34) , whereas the deeper layers receive topographically organized visual, auditory, and somatosensory input (8, 15, 33, 35) . In some species, specialized spatial senses such as infrared and magneto-and electrosenses and echolocation send topographically organized inputs to the SC (8, (36) (37) (38) . Within a species, the sensory topographic maps in different layers of the SC are superposed, meaning specific regions of space are represented by similar points in each overlaid sensory map (39) . This arrangement allows a point of convergence for processed spatially structured information, in turn allowing an integrated sense of space that includes the position, state, and movement of the body (9, (40) (41) (42) . Organizing behavior by reference to an integrated simulation of the state of the mobile body in space also provides an efficient neural solution for resolving the confusing sensory input caused by self-motion [the so-called reafference problem (43) ]. Bodily motion causes widespread changes in sensory input, yet we seamlessly disambiguate our own movements from the movements of objects around us. In mammals, the multisensory inputs to the SC include inputs from the vestibular system ( 44 ), information on eye position (45) (46) (47) , and somatosensation (8) . This allows the influence of self-motion on the sensory fields to be factored out of the constructed sensory model of the environment (42) . Resolving the reafference problem is a key function for the mammalian SC, which is why this region is vital for organizing motion in space for directed attention, reaching, and grasping for targets (41, (48) (49) (50) . For active animals with well-developed spatial senses, it is computationally more effective to resolve the reafference problem once for a unified sensory model than to resolve it in a dispersed and peripheral way for each sense independently. Further, different senses are affected by reafference in different ways and contribute different information on how the body is moving. Reafference can thus be resolved with greater accuracy and precision by integrating information from multiple senses (9) . For mammals, the processing performed within the SC constructs something akin to a simulation of the moving body in the environment (9) . For humans at least, this spatial "model" is further enhanced by processing within the subcortical dorsal pulvinar (one of the thalamic nuclei, part of the basal ganglia) (32) , which adds color, three-dimensionality, and an egocentric first-person perspective to the human conscious experience of space. A major benefit of this integrated spatial simulation is that it allows animals to interact with objects in a qualitatively different set of ways than simple stimulus-bound organisms could manage. Animals that navigate by reference to a simulated spatial model can actively seek out and navigate toward hidden objects. It is worth emphasizing what is implied by such an apparently simple navigational ability. A food source concealed behind a barrier, for example, is neither part of an organism's current sensory input nor accessible by following a simple vector with its origin at the animal's current position. Navigation requires a unified metric space that allows for effective computation of relative position after both actual and hypothetical translations within that space (51) (52) (53) (54) . This is beyond the primary sensory input but can be supported by a simulation of the environment constructed from that input (55) . The midbrain also provides the capacity to resolve competing behavioral priorities or motivations and rank needed resources by both urgency and availability. The floor of the midbrain is formed by the hypothalamic structures and associated nuclei whose function is to integrate information from the nervous and endocrine systems, to harvest and respond to information on the physiological status of the organism, and to motivate behavior to maintain a homeostatic optimum (56) (Fig. 1B ). Maintaining homeostasis requires actively seeking needed resources; hence, midbrain structures are critical for the initiation and direction of a wide range of goal-directed behavior (15, 56) . Integrative structures within the midbrain and basal ganglia, including the periaqueductal gray, substantia nigra, ventral thalamus, striatum, and midbrain reticular formation, combine this information on introspective assessment of state with exteroceptive assessment of ). These domains interact and can be resolved by referencing an integrated neural model that contains information on the state of self, self movement, environmental state and structure, and memory of prior experience. These elements of the neural model are supported by midbrain structures (B). As a simplification, regions are colored according to their primary function(s) in the neural model described in A. The superior colliculus [part of the tectum (TEC) forming the roof of the midbrain] receives topographically organized multisensory input and creates an integrated neural model of the organism moving in space (8) . The floor of the midbrain is formed by the hypothalamic structures (Hyp) and associated nuclei [pituitary (pt) and mammillary bodies (M)] that collate information on the physiological status of the organism referenced with prior experience, to identify needs to maintain a homeostatic optimum (15, 56) . Integrative structures within the midbrain and basal ganglia, including the periaqueductal gray (P), substantia nigra (N), thalamus (Tha), striatum (St), and midbrain reticular formation (MR), integrate these sources of information (8, 33) (A). In advanced vertebrates the cortex and hippocampal structures clearly have a very strong input in to this system, but this midbrain system is not dependent on cortical inputs to function (140) and is highly conserved across all vertebrate lineages (33) . location in space to collate and resolve competing motivations, prioritize resources, and select targets and actions (8, 33) . Midbrain and basal ganglia structures thus provide an effective and efficient neural solution for decision making (Fig. 1A ). Competing and potentially conflicting behavioral responses that might be stimulated by different inputs can be resolved within a single behavioral control system (33, 57) . Target selection and action selection must interact (Fig. 1A ) because each domain informs the others. Motivational factors will influence the prioritization of targets and therefore action selection, but the location of targets will also influence which is selected, and which actions should be taken (8) . Merker (8, 9) describes this as a "behavioral core control system" within which these decision domains can be resolved. Analyses and modeling of basal ganglia function in vertebrates have emphasized how drawing together all evidence for different possible actions within a unified neural system enables an effective and efficient solution for action selection, without having to posit a higher-level decision maker reflecting on the decision (57) (58) (59) . Placing the basic capacity for subjective experience in subcortical structures does not rule out a role for the cortex and other subcortical systems (including hippocampal systems) in conscious experience. The contents of subjective experience will vary enormously between species, and that variation will depend in part on the degree of elaboration of cortical structures. However, the capacity for subjective experience is not dependent on containing any particular contents (9, 32) . The basic capacity for subjective experience that the midbrain supports is rather a capacity to have any subjective contents at all. The midbrain thus provides a forum for specific contents to be integrated together with more basic survival-oriented machinery. However, the modeling function of the midbrain does not require some overseer that reflects on the model [the fallacy of the "Cartesian theater" (60) ]. Decisions arise directly from this model, not from some further decision-making process informed by the model. It is worth distinguishing the current proposal for the substrate of subjective experience from other, related, accounts. Like global workspace theories (61) , we emphasize the role of consciousness in bringing together disparate brain processes into a common arena. Global workspace theories have a strongly cortical bias, however, focusing on the contribution of human fronto-parietal regions to reflective self-awareness of our mental states. It is unclear how widely this generalizes. We propose that even for invertebrates-which lack anything remotely like an elaborate cortex-holistic integration is essential for the more basic, evolutionarily ancient behavioral demands of action selection, reafference adjustment, and navigation. Further, insofar as cortical processes can matter to the organism, we argue that they must ultimately be integrated via midbrain mechanisms (58, 62) . As Merker (8) puts it, the midbrain control system is "anatomically subcortical [but] functionally supra-cortical." Like information integration theories of consciousness (63-65), we claim that consciousness performs an important synthetic role. Unlike information integration theories, however, it matters which information is unified. Subjective experience requires the construction of an integrated neural simulation of the agent in space, weighted by the state of the agent. This simulation is constructed from appropriate integration of afferent, efferent, and homeostatic information. Just integrating information is not sufficient for subjective experience, no matter how complex or well-integrated the information. Information integration theorists have also tended to take a more liberal and graded view of consciousness, suggesting that even simple circuits such as a photodiode attached to memory might have a "modicum of experience" (65) . By contrast, our theory implies that there is a definite cutoff point below which there is definitely not subjective experience (a point to which we will return). Unified modeling provides effective solutions to the reafference problem and action selection for motile animals with developed spatially coherent senses (such as vision) (9, 66, 67) . As such, it is not surprising that the vertebrate midbrain behavioral core control system evolved early on in the group and has been largely conserved since. Lampreys (primitive jawless fish) have functional homologs of all of the key nuclei involved in the vertebrate behavioral core control system (sensu ref. 8) including a well-developed tectum to process spatially structured visual information (68, 69) and equivalents of the basal ganglia system to resolve action and target selection (67, 70) . It is thus a commitment of our model that subjective experience is likely to be universal among the vertebrates. What about invertebrate groups? Consciousness in Insects The insects are an extremely diverse group, but all insect brains have a common anatomical plan (Fig. 2 ). The nervous system contains an enlarged cephalic ganglion (a brain) specialized for sensory processing and integration. This is linked by paired ventral nerve cords to a series of smaller ganglia for the thoracic and abdominal body segments. The insect nervous system has frequently been stereotyped as decentralized (71) , with the cephalic ganglion acting simply as a region of sensory input that triggers motor responses organized by the segmental ganglia (8, 71) . This interpretation is incorrect and outdated. The insect brain resolves action and target selection, processes sensory information, and clearly executes a command function over the behavioral system (72) . A compelling demonstration of the command function of the insect brain for the total behavioral system of the insect is the effect of focused injection of neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists to the region of the central complex (CX) of the insect brain. The parasitoid jewel wasp Ampulex compressa uses its ovipositor to inject venom containing GABA and octopamine antagonists into the CX of its cockroach prey (72, 73) . The venom is not paralytic: the cockroach is still able to perform many basic actions. Rather, the pharmacological lesion to the central protocerebrum containing the CX disrupts the cockroach's behavioral program, rendering it entirely passive so that it will not struggle as the wasp leads the cockroach by the antennae into its burrow. The effect of Ampulex venom on the cockroach brain is thus to eliminate the capacity of the roach to organize and initiate behavior (73) . This example shows that the central brain structures are key for the initiation and direction of movement in cockroaches and crickets (74, 75) . Further, the CX of the insect brain seems specialized for the processing of spatial information and organization of movement (76) . As such (we argue), it performs functions analogous to the vertebrate tectum/colliculus (Fig. 2 ). Like the vertebrate tectum/ colliculus, the CX plays a crucial role in processing multiple sources of spatial information drawn from different senses. Many insects are sensitive to plane-polarized light, a vital celestial navigational cue. In locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) information on the distribution of polarized light in the sky is processed by the CX, which creates a central polarotopic representation of the sky polarization pattern (77) . Outputs from this system could provide compass-like information to stabilize the direction of moving insects relative to the external celestial cue (78) . This function for the CX has been described in locusts and butterflies (Danaus plexippus) but may be common across insect orders (79) . Further, in S. gregaria (80) , the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis (75) , and Drosophila melanogaster (81, 82) , the CX encodes topographically organized visual information on moving objects and is capable of factoring out the confounding effects of visual motion generated by self-movement from moving objects in the environment (82) . In Drosophila, neural activity within the CX encodes the fly's heading relative to visual landmarks in the environment and presumably enables the fly to maintain a course relative to those landmarks (83) . The CX is also vital for flies to learn spatial tasks (84, 85) . Collectively these studies emphasize the capacity of the insect CX to represent visual space such that the insect can orient and navigate. However, the CX processes more than just visual information. In cockroaches (86) , Drosophila (83), and crickets (74) , the CX also encodes topographically organized mechanosensory and proprioceptive information, corrected for reafference, to resolve the movements and orientation of the body and limbs in space. The CX is necessary producing actions that involve coordination of limbs on both sides of the body (such as turning), and also for judging distance in targeting and reaching (87) . The various topographically organized sensory maps are layered in Drosophila (79), and it would seem the sensory maps are integrated because the encoding of azimuth in the Drosophila CX can switch seamlessly between a reliance on visual landmarks in the light to a reliance on proprioceptive cues in the dark (83) . New electrophysiological studies of the visual interneurons of the lobula of the Drosophila brain have shown how a flying fly can resolve the reafference problem (88) . Visual interneurons that register optic flow in the visual field receive a motor-related input when the fly turns, which precisely counters the visual stimulation of the neurons caused by the turn (88) . The electrophysiological data support von Holst and Mittelstaedt's (43) classic theory, and inferences from insect behavioral studies (89) (90) (91) , that an "efference copy" of a motor action is sent to the visual system to silence the specific image motion caused by a voluntary turn. The motorrelated input to the lobula is specific and anticipatory of the motor action, cautiously supporting a forward model of action selection (where modeling of the movement and its consequences precedes the movement itself) (88, 92) . Although we still do not know how the efference copy to the lobula is generated, it seems increasingly likely that CX circuits are involved. One of the crucial functions of the CX is thus to generate a neural simulation of the state of the moving insect in space. This simulation forms part of the insect behavioral core control system (Fig. 2 ). The CX outputs to, and receives input from, the protocerebrum (P) of the insect brain, especially the lateral accessory lobe which is a point of convergence for sensory information. These include both direct inputs from the sensory lobes and indirect inputs via the CX and mushroom body (MB) pathways (Fig. 2 ), which are a locus for memory of past experience. The P is premotor, and emerging evidence suggests that competitive processing within structures of the P contributes to effective action selection based on all available sensory information (93) (94) (95) (96) . In sum, new functional analyses of the insect brain emphasize how it supports a behavioral core control system that is functionally analogous to that of the vertebrate midbrain (Fig. 2 ). This no doubt supports much of the dynamic and flexible behavior for which some insects are famous. Some of the central-place foraging ants and bees have remarkable navigational skills and spatial memory and are clearly able to organize their behavior with respect to more than simply their immediate sensory environment. They will perform targeted searches in appropriate locations and at appropriate times (97) for resources they have experienced previously. Several insect species have been shown to be able to plot novel routes based on learned landmarks and goals, evidencing a spatial relation of landmark information (98, 99) . The honey bee dance communication system requires a dance follower to determine a flight vector relative to celestial cues from symbolic and stereotyped dance movements (100) . All these behaviors require a form of neural modeling of space. There is now both behavioral and electrophysiological evidence that the neural modeling of the environment performed by insects involves multiple layers of filtering of sensory information to support selective attention to stimuli that are salient and suppression of representation of irrelevant stimuli (101) (102) (103) (104) . The amount and amplitude of firing activity within certain defined frequency bands in the central brain of tethered flies in response to visual stimuli is dependent on whether the fly is visually fixed on the stimulus or whether the context of the stimulus has changed (101) . This change in neural activity has been described as a neural signature of "salience" in insects (101, 102) . The brain region in which this occurs includes the point of interaction between the MB, CX, and P circuits, and the electrophysiological response is dependent on a functioning MB (101, 102) . These findings show how the brain responses to environmental stimuli in insects are not driven simply by the primary sensory input, but rather by egocentric characteristics: whether the context of the stimulus needs to be updated or whether the stimulus is a point of immediate navigational reference (101, 102) . In essence, responses depend upon what the insect is attending to at that moment (104) . In bees, even activity in the optic lobes is influenced by centrifugal input from the central brain to enhance Fig. 2 . Basic functional anatomy of the insect brain (not to scale). The structures of the insect brain create an integrated neural model of the state of the insect in space that is functionally analogous to that described for the vertebrate brain in Fig. 1 . Regions are colored to reflect the major functions described in Fig. 1A . Vision and smell are primarily processed by dedicated sensory lobes, which function to refine and enhance sensory representations and enhance distinctions between similar stimuli (95, 141) . Primary odor processing is performed in the antennal lobes (AL). Visual processing is performed by the lamina (LA), medulla (ME), and lobula (LO). The MB supports learning and memory (142) (143) (144) (145) (146) . The CX is anatomically variable between insect orders but typically is composed of the central body upper (CBU), central body lower (CBL), and noduli (NO). It has several specializations for processing spatial information corrected for self movement (75, 76, 83, 87) . The protocerebrum (P) is an anatomically complicated region. Modulatory and inhibitory connections to and within the protocerebrum convey information on physiological state (94, 95) , and structures within the protocerebrum, particularly the lateral accessory lobe, are involved in integration of information, hence the hatched shading. neural responses to stimuli that are points of visual fixation (103) . These exciting new electrophysiological studies demonstrate more compellingly than behavioral studies alone the subjective and egocentric nature of the neural representation of the environment in insects, and their capacity for selective attention supports our assertion that insects have a capacity for subjective experience. We note that the relationship between subjective experience and selective attention in humans remains a topic of considerable debate (105, 106) . Whether selective attention is a prerequisite for consciousness (105) or whether consciousness is broader than what we attend to ( 106 ) is quite contentious. Because insects clearly have a capacity for selective attention we may safely sidestep this debate for now. However, insect brains could provide powerful experimental systems for future exploration of the relationship between attention and experience in simple animals. The honey bee particularly is held up as an insect with cognitive capacities that rival those of many mammals (107) (108) (109) . Without consideration of the underlying mechanisms, this may seem like no more than a curiosity. The systems that underlie these abilities were shaped by evolutionary pressures similar to those that shaped the mammalian midbrain. The insect brain does a similar sort of modeling, for the same reasons, in a similar way. That is strong evidence that the insect brain has the capacity to support subjective experience. Beyond Insects Our thesis raises two related questions. First, how widespread is subjective experience among the other invertebrates? Second, when did a capacity for subjective experience arise? To the question of how widespread subjective experience is among the invertebrates, we answer that it is likely to be more extensive than previously thought, but far from universal. One of the virtues of the account we have endorsed is that it also gives an evidence-based argument for where to draw the line between the haves and have-nots. There are other, simpler ways to organize animal behavior than by creating the kind of integrated neural simulation seen in the insect and vertebrate core control systems. These simpler systems cannot support a capacity for subjective experience. An informative, if simple, example is the cubozoan box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora. This species shows dynamic behavior that includes actively hunting its prey. It has a well-developed geosense and visual sense thanks to 24 lensed eyes distributed around the body (110, 111) , yet the nervous system is entirely decentralized. Sense organs independently modulate activity in regions of the sensory net and muscle walls to steer the animal (112) . The outcome of local sensory input acting on local muscle activity is an adaptive change in the swimming direction and speed of the animal (112) , but the simple behavioral control system is entirely decentralized. Although such systems manifest the appearance of adaptive and dynamic targeting, they are nothing more than simple decentralized stimulus-response systems. They could not reasonably be expected to support any form of subjective experience. Centralization is necessary for subjective experience, but it is not sufficient. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses a famously simple and well-characterized centralized nervous system that can integrate input from an array of thermo-, mechano-, chemo-, and nociceptors, along with an interoceptive sense of time to organize directed movements (113) . Sensory inputs are integrated at the level of an array of interneurons that compete for activation of the motor neurons (113) . The simple nervous system of C. elegans can also support various forms of learning such as habituation (114) (115) (116) and classical associative conditioning (116) (117) (118) , enabling adaptive change in behavior with experience. Nematodes are thus able to integrate multiple forms of sensory input using a centralized nervous system, but it seems that their behavior is organized as responses either to the immediate sensory environment or to immediate interoceptive signals of physiological state. Action selection in nematodes is driven by shifts in global brain dynamics (119) , and there is sufficient plasticity in the nematode nervous system for their responses to vary with system state (120). However, there is no evidence that nematodes can actively hunt for things beyond their immediate sensory environment. Hungry nematodes respond to starvation with increased locomotion and dispersal in a random, rather than directed, search (121, 122) . By contrast, hungry rodents, ants, and bees will navigate to places where they have previously encountered food. Their internal state of hunger triggers a highly directional and oriented food search focused on locations where food was previously experienced, even if no food stimuli are currently present (123) (124) (125) . Hence, in mammals and insects homeostatic drives direct behavior to where resources are expected to be, even if they are not currently there. We argue the difference between this behavior and nematode search behavior arises because nematode behavior is organized by reference to their primary sensory input, whereas rodent and insect behavior is organized in response to an integrated and spatial simulation of their environment. Nematodes do possess forms of memory (116) that can change how they react to stimuli (120) , but there is no evidence this memory has a spatial component or contributes to a structured model of their environment. Consequently, even though nematodes have a centralized nervous system and memory, they lack the egocentric modeling of the environment that is required for subjective experience. Further, it is because they lack the capacity to make such models that they are unable to do a variety of tasks that vertebrates and insects handle with ease. As a group, nematodes may have evolved a simplified body plan and nervous system as a consequence of evolving to exploit very stable environments or a parasitic existence (126, 127) . In such environments, very simple behavioral control systems are sufficient. If the insect brain supports subjective experience, then this not only increases the diversity of animals considered to have these abilities-it also requires a reconsideration of when this ability might have appeared on Earth. As noted above, the key structural elements of the vertebrate behavioral core control system are all present and functional in lampreys (128) . If these structures are present in the basal vertebrates then they may also have been present in the basal vertebrate species Haikouichthys identified in Cambrian fossil fauna (128) . This species had welldeveloped eyes and a hydrodynamic eel-like body (129) . It is reconstructed as an active swimmer (129) and presumably had a version of an operational behavioral core control system for the organization of dynamic and active movement, action selection, and target selection (128) . The insect behavioral core control system is likely to be similarly ancient. Cambrian fossil faunas are famous for their arthropod diversity, many of which had complex jointed limbs and bodies, sensory appendages, and well-developed image-forming compound eyes (130) (131) (132) (133) . These have been reconstructed as having active lifestyles, and arthropods were the top predators of the period (130) (131) (132) (133) . At least some of these arthropods had well-developed cephalic ganglia with structural similarities to extant crustacean and insect brains (134) . We argue it is likely that a version of the extant insect behavioral core control system must have been present in at least some Cambrian arthropods to support their active foraging and hunting lifestyles. The CX is basal to the insect clade. Although there is some variation in the structure of the CX between insect orders, this structure features in all insects and crustaceans and is likely homologous to the arcuate body of arachnids (87, 135, 136) , suggesting a form of the CX evolved before the radiation of insects, crustaceans, and spiders. Trestman (130) has argued that the spatial awareness and agentive behavior enabled by arthropod neural and sensory systems may have contributed to the arthropod radiation in the Cambrian as a consequence of the emergence of new forms of behavior such as hunting. It is plausible that some of the Cambrian fauna within both the basal vertebrate and arthropod groups had a capacity for subjective experience. It is presently unclear whether the insect and vertebrate behavioral core control systems evolved independently. Strausfeld and Hirth (137) marshal commanding developmental, anatomical, and genetic evidence to argue a possible deep homology of the insect CX and associated structures with vertebrate basal ganglia structures. If this interpretation is correct, it would imply that a brain with a form of higher sensory integration center may even predate the divergence of these groups. Moving Forward on Invertebrate Consciousness We have argued that insects possess a capacity for subjective experience. Many find this a counterintuitive result. A natural place to take issue with our argument is with our reliance on Merker's proposal that the midbrain is sufficient to support subjective experience. Fair enough. Merker's theory is far from universally accepted, and even otherwise similar theories may not (for all we have said) generalize to invertebrates. With Merker, we have emphasized the importance of a unified perspective on the world as a key feature of subjective experience (14) . However, perhaps other neural features are also necessary for subjective experience, such as a representation of a temporal dimension (138) . Perhaps insects lack these (though see ref. 139) . However, this kind of disagreement can be fruitful. If insects do not have subjective experience, why not? What is important, from our perspective, is that either proposing or denying that insects have subjective experience should require telling an evidence-based structural, functional, and comparative story about the insect brain. We have downplayed behavioral data. Critically, we have not relied on evidence of unusual or clever achievements by insects. Rather, we suggest, behavior is important only insofar as it is a guide to understanding the underlying mechanisms by which behavior is generated. We propose that arguing about what subjective experience is, and what is capable of it, is most productive when appealing to empirical neuroscience. We believe that it is on these structural, functional, and comparative grounds that questions about subjective experience-of insects or of any other animal-ought to be settled. Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1. Structures of the vertebrate midbrain (not to scale) supporting the behavioral "core control system." The vertebrate midbrain supports an integrated multisensory model of the state of the animal in space, which supports effective decision making. (A) Decision making involves an assessment of what is needed and where and how the needed resources can be obtained. Decision making can therefore be considered to involve three domains: internal motivations, target selection, and action selection [adapted from the "selection triangle" proposed by Merker (8)]). These domains interact and can be resolved by referencing an integrated neural model that contains information on the state of self, self movement, environmental state and structure, and memory of prior experience. These elements of the neural model are supported by midbrain structures (B). As a simplification, regions are colored according to their primary function(s) in the neural model described in A. The superior colliculus [part of the tectum (TEC) forming the roof of the midbrain] receives topographically organized multisensory input and creates an integrated neural model of the organism moving in space (8) . The floor of the midbrain is formed by the hypothalamic structures (Hyp) and associated nuclei [pituitary (pt) and mammillary bodies (M)] that collate information on the physiological status of the organism referenced with prior experience, to identify needs to maintain a homeostatic optimum (15, 56) . Integrative structures within the midbrain and basal ganglia, including the periaqueductal gray (P), substantia nigra (N), thalamus (Tha), striatum (St), and midbrain reticular formation (MR), integrate these sources of information (8, 33) (A). In advanced vertebrates the cortex and hippocampal structures clearly have a very strong input in to this system, but this midbrain system is not dependent on cortical inputs to function (140) and is highly conserved across all vertebrate lineages (33) . | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1520084113 Barron and Klein | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1520084113 Barron and Klein Acknowledgments We thank Tim Bayne , Lars Chittka , Jean-Marc Devaud , Stanley Heinze , Michael Gillings , and Peter Godfrey-Smith for constructive discussion and feedback.Figs. 1 and 2 were created by Marcus J.

INTRODUCTION A central assumption in predictive-coding theories is that activity in the nervous system reflects a process of matching internally generated predictions to external stimulation (Heekeren et al., 2008; Bar, 2009) . Evidence for this assumption has been collected at different levels of neural processing (Rao and Ballard, 1999; Hosoya et al., 2005; Muckli et al., 2005; Summerfield et al., 2006; Alink et al., 2010) , which suggests that predictive-coding operates across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. A second important assumption in predictive coding is that predictions are transferred from hierarchically higher levels of processing to lower ones, whereas signals traveling in the opposite direction encode prediction errors (Rao and Ballard, 1999; Serences, 2008; Friston, 2009; Grossberg, 2009) . In accordance with terminology commonly used in research on perception, it has thus been suggested that predictive signaling reflects top-down processes, whereas prediction-error signaling constitutes bottomup processing (Friston, 2009; Alink et al., 2010; Hesselmann et al., 2010) . In this review, we argue that predictive coding provides a powerful conceptual framework that goes beyond the standard dichotomy of "bottom-up" and "top-down." We first provide an overview of previous attempts at defining bottom-up and topdown processes, and we highlight their problems and limitations. We then outline how predictive coding offers a unique perspective for re-defining what is meant by these terms. Throughout the remainder of this paper, we refer to ascending and descending connections when discussing the anatomy of biological systems or the architecture of artificial ones (Friston, 2005; Clark, in press) . Functional activity along these two types of connections is referred to as feedforward and feedback, respectively. We avoid additional terms such as "recurrent" or "reentrant," because we believe they can be subsumed under "feedback" in most cases. A SHORT HISTORY OF BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN More than 30 years ago, Kinchla and Wolfe (1979) set out to test whether visual processing is organized bottom-up or top-down. Following up on earlier work (Reicher, 1969; Navon, 1977) , the authors used compound stimuli, where a global shape is made up of smaller, local elements. Upper-case letters were used as stimuli, and top-down processing was assumed to manifest itself in shorter response times (RTs) if the global shape, rather than the local elements, corresponded to a target letter. Bottom-up processing was defined as "the opposite," i.e., faster responses if the local stimulus elements, rather than the overall shape, corresponded to a target letter. Results indicated that whether a global shape or its constituent elements are processed faster critically depends on stimulus size. Kinchla and Wolfe (1979) concluded that visual perception does not proceed strictly bottom-up or top-down, but "middle-out." They suggested that the visual system uses the information most readily available in the context of, for example, a particular stimulus size and viewing distance. Based on this information, the system would then work its way toward more global or more local aspects, as required by the task. More recently, Melloni et al. (2012) examined the generation of saliency maps in the visual cortex with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The authors refer to bottom-up salience as the degree of difference between a stimulus and its neighbors. In their visual search task, target and distractor gratings differed in orientation. Bottom-up salience was manipulated by adding color as an additional stimulus dimension. Thus, the target stimulus could be either a singleton in terms of color and orientation; a singleton in terms of orientation only; or a singleton in terms of orientation accompanied by a distractor singleton in terms of color. Top-down control is described by Melloni et al. (2012) as the influence of our inner goals on stimulus selection. This was manipulated by presenting trials of different degrees of bottom-up salience either in blocks or randomly intermixed. Results indicated that primary visual cortex (V1) encodes only bottom-up salience, V2 encodes only top-down control settings, and V4 encodes the interaction between the two. The authors concluded that multiple saliency maps are present at different levels of processing. Stimulus selection could thus be flexibly adapted by referring to the saliency map most relevant in the context of a given task (Weidner et al., 2009) . In the three decades between the studies of Kinchla and Wolfe (1979) and Melloni et al. (2012) , conceptual and methodological advances have substantially increased our knowledge of sensory processing in general and of the visual system in particular. What hasn't changed during this time is our notion of bottom-up and top-down processes. Staying with our first example, Kinchla and Wolfe (1979) wrote: [. . .] the electrophysiological analysis of "receptive fields" seemed to suggest a bottom-up mode of processing: Cells associated with progressively more complex fields [. . .] were found as one went from the retina to the visual cortex, as if systems for detecting low-order "features" [. . .] fed into systems for detecting progressively more complex patterns. (Kinchla and Wolfe, 1979, p. 225) [. . .] it has been suggested that the order of visual processing is best described as a top-down process, with higher-order forms processed first, followed by lower-order forms [. . .] (ibd.) Compare this to a more recent definition is given by Palmer (1999) : " Bottom-up" processing [. . .] refers to processes that take a "lower-level" representation as input and create or modify a "higher-level" representation as output. Top-down processing [. . .] refers to processes that operate in the opposite direction, taking a "higher-level" representation as input and producing or modifying a "lower-level" representation as output. (Palmer, 1999, pp. 84-85) The common denominator of these and virtually all other definitions of bottom-up and top-down processes can be summarized as follows: 1. Information processing is organized hierarchically. 2. Lower levels of the hierarchy represent detailed stimulus information, while higher levels represent more integrated information. 3. Information exchange between levels is bidirectional. The apparent simplicity of these assumptions may explain why the terms bottom-up and top-down are used so frequently in research on perception. However, these assumptions can be questioned, and we briefly highlight some of the problems surrounding them. A NOTE ON HIERARCHIES Felleman and Van Essen (1991) advocated a distributed processing hierarchy in the primate visual cortex based on anatomical connectivity patterns. More recently, however, Hegdé and Felleman (2007) noted that a hierarchically organized anatomical structure does not imply that visual processing is itself hierarchical, nor that the functional hierarchy (if it exists) matches the anatomical one (Rousselet et al., 2004) . Moreover, Hegdé and Felleman (2007) state that the anatomical hierarchy itself is clear-cut only up to the level of areas V4 and MT, with the sender-receiver distinction becoming less evident at higher levels. Thus, the notion of hierarchical processing can be criticized on both structural and functional grounds. These criticisms may be partly resolved by adopting a more flexible view of structural and functional hierarchies. An example for such a view is provided by Engel et al. (2001) , who distinguish four "flavors" of top-down: 1. an anatomical one, equating top-down processes with functional activity along descending connections between the levels of the hierarchy 2. a cognitivist one, where top-down means hypothesis-driven processing 3. a gestaltist one, viewing top-down processes in terms of contextual modulations of bottom-up processing 4. a dynamicist one, describing top-down processes in terms of an entrainment of local neuronal populations by widespread oscillatory activity in distant and distributed brain regions. The last of these flavors does not require a fixed anatomical or functional hierarchy. It accommodates flexible recruitment of brain regions for different tasks, without negating the known specializations of these regions. Indeed, the difficulties in establishing clear-cut processing hierarchies in the central nervous system based on either anatomical or functional criteria may be a direct consequence of the system's adaptability. Thus, rather than relying on a fixed hierarchy for processing all types of stimuli and performing all sorts of tasks, it seems likely that the system uses different hierarchies for different tasks. This does not mean that the notion of processing hierarchies is obsolete, but that hierarchical processing should be seen as a conceptual simplification. Incidentally, the problems associated with hierarchical processing models were already recognized by Kinchla and Wolfe (1979) . They stated that although individual images could usefully be described in terms of a hierarchy of features, the knowledge underlying our perception of these images had neither top nor bottom. Nevertheless, they argued that conceptualizing this knowledge as hierarchically organized remains a useful simplification. Intriguingly, their discussion also points to the role of predictability in establishing these hierarchies: [. . .] a major reason for such [a hypothetical hierarchical] organization is the life-long sequential pattern of our visual experience whereby recognition of a form at one level of struc- ture is an almost invariant precursor of the recognition of forms at levels slightly higher or lower. (Kinchla and Wolfe, 1979, p. 229 ) PROBLEMS Even if one accepts the basic assumptions underlying hierarchical processing models, there are a number of problems associated with current notions of bottom-up and top-down processes. Some examples from the literature will demonstrate that one author's top-down may well be another one's bottom-up. A FUZZY DICHOTOMY In a recent position paper, Theeuwes (2010a) reviewed evidence for the notion that initial processing of a visual stimulus is exclusively driven by bottom-up factors. The author focuses on selection processes in visual search tasks and defines top-down selection as: completely under control of the intentions of the observer an active volitional process based on expectancy and goal set (Theeuwes, 2010a, pp. 77-78) Bottom-up selection, on the other hand, is described as: determined by the feature properties present in the environment passive [and] automatic associated with salience driven by emotional content or previous experience (ibd.) Independent of whether or not one subscribes to Theeuwes' (2010a) point of view, the number of concepts invoked to define two commonly used terms suggests that there is actually more to consider than a simple dichotomy. In other words, the use of a simple binary classification does not appear to capture the profusion of mental processes or functions described in these statements, which include intention, volition, expectation, and emotion. Accordingly, a large part of the discussion of Theeuwes' (2010a) target paper concerns the delimitation of bottom-up and top-down processes (Egeth et al., 2010; Folk and Remington, 2010; Kristjánsson, 2010; Theeuwes, 2010b) . SEARCHING FOR THE TOP Importantly, the problems with distinguishing bottom-up from top-down processes are not limited to psychological studies. Confusion also seems to reign at the apparently more solid level of cellular neuroscience. For example, Roland et al. (2006) used voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging in anesthetized ferrets. The authors found that exposure to a luminance-defined square elicited forward and lateral activation spread that was followed by a feedback wave of activity traveling from extrastriate visual areas to V1. This feedback wave selectively highlighted first the stimulus representation and then the representation of the background. Roland et al. describe this feedback wave as a possible mechanism of top-down influences on early visual cortex. Kuhn et al. (2008) , on the other hand, used depth-resolved VSD imaging in mice during anesthesia and wakefulness. The authors observed characteristic desynchronizations in layer 1 of the somatosensory cortex upon awakening. They consider this as evidence for long-range cortical and thalamic input exerting top-down control over sensory processing during wakefulness. Arguably, the term "top-down" is conceptually useless if it describes neural activity during both wakefulness (Kuhn et al., 2008) and anesthesia (Roland et al., 2006) , with sources in either closely neighboring regions (Roland et al., 2006) or anywhere in the nervous system (Kuhn et al., 2008) . However, such an interpretation directly emerges from what Engel et al. (2001) termed the anatomical flavor of top-down. That is, if activity along descending fibers necessarily reflects top-down processes, the latter may originate from any source connected to the current region of interest, provided that the source is located at a higher level of the hierarchy. And if source activity persists during sleep or anesthesia, this would also qualify as top-down activity. Barlow (1997) succinctly noted this problem, stating that the visual system has no top. Reviewing potential sources of knowledge used in visual processing, he argues that the interaction of the genetically determined structure of the visual system and the redundancies present in all visual images may explain many of the effects usually attributed to top-down factors. He concludes: To avoid the top-down/bottom-up dichotomy blinding us to more important questions, the term "top-down" should perhaps be challenged whenever it is used [. . .] ( Barlow, 1997, p. 1146) Barlow's (1997) understanding of top-down processes is that they involve outside knowledge previously acquired through training or teaching and brought to act upon current sensory input. Here, "outside" refers to regions of the nervous system not primarily concerned with visual processing. While we fully agree with Barlow's (1997) conclusion, it seems what his argument essentially highlights is the vagueness of what is meant by a top-down process. His critique rests on the assumption that bottom-up processing consists of the interplay between the system's genetically predetermined structure and the organism's current environment. However, since the structure of the system also defines how it stores and retrieves previously encoded information, his understanding of bottom-up processes seems to leave hardly any room for top-down processes. BOTTOM-UP/TOP-DOWN VS. FEEDFORWARD/FEEDBACK In summary, current notions of bottom-up and top-down processes lump together largely disparate structures and functions. As a consequence, it is often unclear whether there is a difference between bottom-up and top-down processes on the one hand and feedforward and feedback activity, on the other. In this context, it is interesting to note that a number of authors speak of "top-down feedback" to refer to attention-induced modulations of either stimulus-evoked activity (Martínez et al., 2001) , baseline activity (Kastner et al., 1999) , or background connectivity (Al-Aidroos et al., 2012) . In most of these cases, the aim seems to be to highlight the parallels between the psychological description of higher cognitive processes and the anatomical description of fibers connecting high-level to low-level regions. However, a more literal interpretation would suggest that, if one has to specify that a certain type of feedback is top-down, other types of feedback are not. We will return to this idea in the following section. PLASTICITY In an original demonstration of how culture shapes perception, Tse and Cavanagh (2000) showed that the direction of apparentmotion perceived during the stepwise presentation of a Chinese character differs between Chinese and American participants. The character in question was unveiled one stroke at a time, without actual movements contained in the stimulus. Based on Gestalt principles (Wagemans et al., 2012a,b) , the last stroke was expected to be perceived as a right-to-left movement, and this is what American subjects reported seeing. On the other hand, a majority of Chinese subjects reported seeing a movement from left to www.frontiersin.org right, in accordance with the movement performed when writing the character. The authors concluded that bottom-up cues for motion perception can be overridden by top-down factors linked to culturally shaped expectations. In their discussion, Tse and Cavanagh (2000) note that: The "standard" view of top-down processing is that later visual areas influence earlier areas via feedback connections. There are other possibilities, however. Expectation and knowledge could in principle alter the circuitry involved in grouping, in which case a top-down influence would be exerted in a bottom-up manner (Tse and Cavanagh, 2000, p. B32) This interpretation of top-down processes raises an important issue: beyond the differences in how bottom-up and top-down processes are conceptualized, individual differences may well lead to situations where one participant's bottom-up is another one's top-down. SOLUTIONS Given these ubiquitous problems, we believe it is time that the concepts of bottom-up and top-down be refined based on current evidence. We briefly highlight previous work aiming in this direction, before outlining a predictive-coding model that may help resolve some of the issues outlined above. TOP-DOWN = FEEDBACK In an insightful commentary on Theeuwes (2010a), Rauschenberger (2010) argues that the dichotomy between bottom-up and top-down processes should be abandoned altogether in light of ever-increasing evidence on the importance of interactive information processing in perception (Di Lollo et al., 2000) . Rauschenberger (2010) goes on to propose that the directionality of neural pathways does not necessarily correspond to their primary or exclusive involvement in bottom-up or top-down processes. The idea that ascending and descending pathways may be jointly involved in both bottom-up and top-down processes seems to us the single most important insight for salvaging these concepts. Accordingly, this idea is at the core of our own proposals below. A THIRD ELEMENT Following the lively discussion surrounding his position paper (Theeuwes, 2010a) , Theeuwes co-authored an article entitled "Top-down vs. bottom-up attentional control: a failed theoretical dichotomy" (Awh et al., 2012) . The authors make the point that attentional control cannot be fully described when only bottomup salience and top-down goals are taken into account. Rather, selection history needs to be considered as well, i.e., whether a particular stimulus was previously task-relevant or rewarded. Awh et al. (2012) highlight how differences in selection history are often confounded with top-down effects such as selective attention, and how this may explain some of the contradictory findings in the visual search literature (e.g., Maljkovic and Nakayama, 1996; Wolfe et al., 2003) . The central and sometimes paradoxical role of selection history on attentional control is also in accordance with the idea that active predictions of incoming information may affect sensory processing at multiple levels. As Awh et al. put it: [. . .] we believe that [selection history effects] share one core feature: in each case, past selection episodes are recapitulated in subsequent trials when the relevant context is encountered again. (Awh et al., 2012, p. 440) Notwithstanding the importance of selection history effects, we are unsure whether adding a third concept to the discussion is helpful. Indeed, the definition given by Awh and co-workers is so broad that it spans virtually all types of neural activity, as selection history may be encoded at very different hierarchical levels (Treue, 2003) and on very different time-scales (Barlow, 1997) . A PREDICTIVE-CODING ACCOUNT In the following, we outline a predictive-coding model from which we derive simple and unequivocal definitions of bottom-up and top-down processes. Our goal is not to provide detailed guidelines for distinguishing these processes in complex biological systems. Rather, we aim to re-establish top-down and bottom-up as useful heuristic categories. In order to do so, we start from two simple premises: 1. Bottom-up and top-down are not opposites. 2. Within hierarchical systems, both ascending and descending connections are involved in bottom-up and top-down processes. These premises are an extension of the main idea underlying predictive-coding theories and more general accounts of brain function (Summerfield and Egner, 2009; Friston, 2010) : namely, that bidirectional information exchange between the levels of hierarchical systems serves to reconcile incoming information with internally generated predictions. If this is the case, there are two classes of questions one may ask about the system: 1. How is stimulus information compared to predictions? 2. Where do predictions come from, and where are prediction errors routed to? For the second class of questions, we believe the most interesting functional unit is the loop formed by a central region that generates predictions and a lower-level region that receives stimulus information and/or prediction-error signals from the periphery. Now consider a biologically inspired, yet-to-be programed computer model similar to previously published computational accounts of the visual cortex (Rao and Ballard, 1999 ). The model system is hierarchically organized over several levels, with increasingly complex stimulus attributes represented at higher levels. For the time being, we further assume that ascending and descending connections only link neighboring areas within the hierarchy. Combining these assumptions leaves us with a series of loops as shown in Figure 1 . We propose that these loops constitute the basis of bottom-up processing. In other words, bottom-up processing consists of one or more cycles of feedforward-feedback activity along ascending and descending connections, instantiated across pairs of neighboring areas in the hierarchy. This iterative, multilayered process reflects the current, semi-hardwired architecture of the system, which in turn reflects a combination of phylogenetic and ontogenetic information available to the organism. The crucial point here is that we explicitly assign a role in bottom-up processing to descending connections between neighboring areas in the hierarchy. Bottom-up processing along this series of loops is reliable and relatively fast (Bullier, 2001; Bacon-Mace et al., 2005) . However, it is not very flexible. It is now generally appreciated that even the earliest levels of sensory processing remain malleable throughout life (Neville and Bavelier, 2002; Bavelier et al., 2010) . Animal studies have demonstrated that intense training followed by appropriate consolidation can lead to long-lasting modifications of neural responses in primary sensory cortices virtually from the first spike onward (Crist et al., 2001; Li et al., 2004) . Recent evidence from human studies points in the same direction (Schwartz et al., 2002; Pourtois et al., 2008; Bao et al., 2010) . This is what we refer to as a semi-hardwired architecture: one that is sufficiently stable to allow for rapid processing of stimuli that have been frequently encountered, either over the course of a species' evolution or during an individual's lifespan; and that is at the same time sufficiently flexible to adapt to lasting and pervasive changes in the organism's environment. However, neural plasticity at the time-scales examined in the above-mentioned studies does not offer enough flexibility to an organism in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. Thus, at a conceptual level, top-down processes can be conceived of as influences that confer moment-to-moment flexibility onto the semi-hardwired network that at any given time ensures efficient and reliable sensory processing in known environments. This relates to the assumption that the hierarchical organization of sensory systems seen across modalities and species reflects two basic imperatives in terms of predictive coding (Barlow, 1985) : first, to take in a maximum of new information in order to detect contingencies in the environment; and second, to exploit these contingencies, once extracted, to construct predictions about the environment which can be rapidly applied to guide adaptive behavior. Contingencies and the predictions based upon them vary in complexity, and there is rich evidence showing that low-level contingencies may be reflected in the basic organization of low-level sensory cortices (Rao and Ballard, 1999; Barlow, 2001) , and even at the level of the retina (Srinivasan et al., 1982; Barlow, 1997; Hosoya et al., 2005) . A particularly striking example is given by the seminal work of Rao and Ballard (1999) : the authors trained an artificial neural network with natural images and explained end-stopping, an extra-classical receptive field property of V1 neurons, in terms of the frequent occurrence in their stimulus material of oriented lines extending beyond the small receptive fields of the model's V1 neurons. High-level contingencies, on the other hand, relate to the higher-order causes of what is currently perceived (Friston, 2005) and can often only be detected by integrating information across large portions of space, long intervals of time, and multiple modalities (Clark, in press) . As an example, consider natural languages: understanding a spoken or written phrase in German can be complicated by the fact that the verb may be positioned more flexibly than for example in English. Thus, crucial aspects of the information transmitted remain unspecified for different periods of time, requiring different processes of verification, interpretation, and prediction (Dambacher et al., 2009) . Importantly, such differences are completely independent of the actual content of the message and also, to some extent, independent of sensory modality. These higher-order contingencies may be subject to more rapid changes (e.g., switching between languages) than the regularities to which the lower levels of sensory systems are tuned (Kersten et al., 2004) , thus rendering adaptations based on longlasting structural reconfigurations or stimulus-specific functional changes inappropriate. We assume that the higher levels in our model system extract such higher-order contingencies and dynamically use them to create a set of relatively abstract predictions that can be rapidly adapted or exchanged. However, for these abstract predictions to be useful, there must be a way for them to effectively modulate iterative bottom-up processing at many different levels of the hierarchy. Therefore, we assume that top-down processes include some form of bypassing or short-circuiting of bottom-up processes. The fastest and most direct route to achieve this would be via direct connections between high-level region L(z) and low-level region L(x) which are not hierarchical neighbors and therefore do not form a bottom-up processing loop. As a first approximation, we thus define top-down processes as instances of direct information transfer from higher to lower regions that skip at least one level in the hierarchy. This anatomical criterion for distinguishing top-down from bottom-up processes specifies the minimal requirements for the conceptual framework outlined above. That is, in order to render bottom-up processing more flexible, high-level regions are assumed to modulate activity in low-level regions using information that is not represented at intermediate levels. This basic idea is depicted in Figure 2 : a high-level region relays information directly to a lower tier of the system, bypassing an area situated more immediately upstream of this target region. Given the reciprocity of most cortical connections (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991) , we assume that top-down processes also involve bidirectional information exchange, i.e., they rely on loops of ascending and descending connections distinct from those mediating bottom-up processing. The main point here is that in our model, backward information transfer between immediate neighbors in the hierarchy does not qualify as top-down processing. This is important because it separates our view of top-down processes from an apparently simpler one based only on direction of information flow. In summary, we propose an anatomical criterion for the separation of functional activity patterns into categories of bottom-up and top-down. Given a strictly hierarchical system, this criterion specifies the minimal requirements for classifying a particular pattern of effective connectivity as top-down: namely, there must be a direct anatomical connection between a source and a target region, and the source must be located at least two levels above the target. TESTING THE PREDICTIVE-CODING ACCOUNT It is important to note that our proposals are not meant to be a comprehensive theory of hierarchical processing. Rather, we provide axiomatic definitions of two equivocal terms commonly invoked to build theories and to interpret empirical results. Our ideas should be critically discussed and empirically tested. Ideally, these tests would demonstrate two things: 1. Our proposals provide a better heuristic for interpreting previous empirical results than current loose notions of bottom-up and top-down processes. 2. Our proposals provide novel hypotheses and correctly predict the outcome of future experiments. Explaining previous results An important limitation of current descriptions of bottom-up and top-down processes is that they largely fail to explain fundamental effects on perceptual processing, such as priming (Grill-Spector et al., 2006) . This limitation clearly emerges in the discussion of the position paper by Theeuwes (2010a) already mentioned. A large part of this discussion focuses on whether priming should be conceived of as a bottom-up (Theeuwes, 2010a,b) or a top-down process (de Fockert, 2010; Egeth et al., 2010; Eimer and Kiss, 2010; Kristjánsson, 2010; Müller et al., 2010) . On the one hand, priming can be seen as a very basic process that one is tempted to classify as purely bottom-up: it is rapid (Dehaene et al., 2001) , often automatic in the sense of being unrelated to the observer's goals (Moors and De Houwer, 2006) , and it can apply to very basic stimulus characteristics coded at the lowest levels of sensory processing (Maljkovic and Nakayama, 1994, 1996) . On the other hand, an increasing body of evidence shows that priming effects can be object-related (Chun and Jiang, 1998; Kristjansson et al., 2008) as well as linked to the observer's goals (Kiefer and Martens, 2010) . More importantly, it is difficult to describe priming as purely stimulus-driven, as it reflects an effect of previous stimulation, and hence some kind of memory trace has to be involved (Kristjánsson, 2010) . We believe our proposals could prove valuable in resolving this debate. They suggest that priming can be instantiated both along the loops of ascending and descending connections between hierarchical neighbors that we have described as the anatomical basis of bottom-up processing, and via top-down processes that operate along long-range cortico-cortical connections (Summerfield et al., 2006) . In this view, priming effects are not seen as a monolithic phenomenon reflecting a unitary process (for a similar arguments, see Henson, 2003; Kristjánsson and Campana, 2010) . Rather, different forms of priming may arise depending on the processes and pathways recruited to yield this sensory facilitation. More specifically, discrepancies in the literature concerning the influence of Frontiers in Psychology | Perception Science goals, task set, etc., on priming could be linked to the involvement (or not) of high-level control regions that represent task-relevant contingencies. Deriving novel hypotheses Our proposals rest on the assumption that top-down processes confer flexibility onto the semi-hardwired network underlying bottom-up processes by short-circuiting the latter. One way to test this central assumption is to show that in the absence of topdown input, bottom-up processing is either substantially delayed or fails entirely (Super et al., 2001) . As an example for testing this idea, consider a study by Muckli et al. (2005) , who showed that the perception of apparent-motion leads to BOLD activity in V1 along the apparent-motion trajectory. The authors concluded that the most likely source for this effect was feedback from area MT to V1. Given that MT is located several levels above V1 in the visual hierarchy (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991) , an unequivocal demonstration that the efficient detection of the (illusory) motion stimulus depends on top-down processes short-circuiting bottom-up processes would require selectively deactivating the connections between V1 and MT in both directions. This should preserve processing along the hierarchy of bottom-up loops up to and beyond MT. Our model suggests that in this case, the perception of illusory motion should be absent, or at least substantially delayed and reduced. While this experiment may be difficult to carry out with current methods, more realistic approaches exist. For example, in an extension of previous work (Pascual-Leone and Walsh, 2001) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), one could temporarily deactivate MT, which should not only reduce the perception of apparent motion, but also the concomitant activity along the apparent-motion trajectory in V1. Such an approach cannot isolate the specific contributions of direct connections between MT and V1. However, if similar effects can be obtained for other types of illusions, involving high-level visual areas other than MT, this would offer converging evidence for our view. CONCLUSION Based on a predictive-coding model, we have outlined a conceptually unequivocal distinction between bottom-up and top-down processes that addresses some of the limitations of our current understanding of these terms. Our proposals highlight the mutual interdependence and constant interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes. Thus, rather than searching for cases of pure bottom-up or top-down processing, future efforts should address their relative contributions as well as the mechanisms of their interaction in the context of a given task.

studies [3] [4] [5] , and over time-due to prolonged adaptation to an attention-amplified stimulusdiminishes sensitivity more than when attention is absent. Four observers (three naïve) participated in the study. In each trial of experiment 1, three observers maintained fixation for varying durations, while they were shown four vertical adapter grating stimuli in the periphery (Fig. 1 ). While they adapted to these gratings, they were also required to attend to one of the four 70% contrast adapter gratings (sustained condition) or to view all four stimuli (neutral condition). The adapter gratings were followed by a slightly tilted test grating, at one of the four locations. Observers reported whether the test grating was tilted to the right or to the left. We obtained contrast thresholds at 75% accuracy using a staircase procedure. Performance on this orientation discrimination task depends on contrast sensitivity 1-5 . For all three observers in the neutral condition (Fig. 2a ), contrast thresholds increased over time, as would be expected given contrast adaptation 8 . In the sustained attention condition, there was an initial benefit: thresholds were lowered in the attended condition. This attentional enhancement of contrast sensitivity (1/threshold) is consistent with previous findings 3,4 . It is possible that the initial benefit was due to reduced forward masking by attention. At short durations, there is little difference between the effects of forward masking and adaptation on threshold elevation 11 . Moreover, we found that over time, the attentional benefit disappeared, and sustained attention eventually led to impaired contrast sensitivity relative to that in the neutral condition. Note that an uncertainty reduction explanation of attention 3-5 cannot account for an attentional impairment. The attentional ratio (contrast thresholds for neutral/ sustained, Fig. 2b ) demonstrated the initial benefit of attention (ratio > 1) and the subsequent cost (ratio < 1). For all three observers, the difference between attended and neutral conditions diminished by 16 s. Sustaining attention at a location for such long durations is taxing, and we suspect that the reduction in impairment with attention at long durations could be due to a weakening of the ability to sustain attention. To quantify how much the adapter contrast was boosted by attention, we assessed how much higher the contrast of the adapting grating needed to be so as to match the effect of attention. By varying the adapter contrast in the neutral condition under a fixed adaptation duration (6 s), we found that observers needed 11-14% higher adapter contrast in order for their threshold elevation to match that found with a 70% contrast adapter in the attended condition (P < 0.05; adapter contrasts: J.F. = 81%, S.L. = 83%, S.F. = 84%). These results demonstrated that attention amplified the strength of a 70% contrast adapter as if its physical contrast were 81-84%. How are unattended locations affected? In a second experiment, we incorporated an invalid cue condition to investigate how contrast adaptation is affected at unattended locations (details in Supplementary Methods online). We predicted that under long adaptation durations, if the strength of unattended signals is suppressed, unattended locations would result in weaker contrast adaptation compared to that in a neutral condition. For all three observers, short adaptation duration (300 ms) thresholds were lowest for the valid (attended) condition and highest for the invalid (unattended) condition (Fig. 3a ). This effect is consistent with previous studies 1,4,5 . Notably, with the 6 s adaptation duration, the effect was reversed (Fig. 3b ): thresholds were highest for the valid, attentional condition and lowest for the invalid, unattended condition. The attentional effect ratios (Fig. 3c ) demonstrated that at 300 ms, the valid cue yielded a benefit, whereas the invalid cue yielded a cost. However, at 6 s, the attended condition led to a cost in contrast sensitivity whereas the unattended one led to a benefit. These results indicate that attention increases the signal strength of the attended adapter and suppresses the signal strength of unattended adapters. These results are consistent with single-unit studies reporting that sustained attention to a stimulus amplifies the contrast gain of neurons in areas of visual cortex such as V4 and MT 6,7 -almost as if the physical contrast amplitude of the stimulus were 'turned up' by attention. Here, we show that attention does indeed boost contrast sensitivity, but prolonged exposure to this higher contrast stimulus results in greater contrast adaptation, and contrast sensitivity to a subsequent, similar test stimulus is impaired by attention. Contrast adaptation occurs at a number of levels in visual cortex, starting as early as VI 8,12 . By demonstrating attentional modulation of adaptation, the present study shows that the effect of attention on perception occurs early in the visual stream, which is consistent with results from singleunit 6,7 and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies 2,13 . Psychophysical and neuroimaging studies have shown that attention can modulate adaptation, as has been observed with motion aftereffects 14 . Indeed, it has been proposed that attention can diminish the representation of a stimulus. The finding that Troxler fading seems to be modulated by attention has been interpreted as a result of a directly inhibitory effect of attention on sensory processing 15 . We propose that this fading can be explained within the framework of attentional enhancement, as follows: because attention boosts the strength of a signal, adaptation increases over time, thus impairing contrast sensitivity. The trial sequence. In each trial, observers viewed a fixation point, followed by four vertically oriented adapter Gabor gratings (2° × 2°; 4 cycles per deg; 70% contrast) positioned at the four possible target locations (7° eccentricity). To minimize luminance adaptation and maximize contrast adaptation, flickering gratings were used (counterphase modulated at 8 Hz). Simultaneous with the adapter gratings, one of two types of cues appeared: a sustained attentional cue or a neutral cue, which served as a baseline. The sustained attentional cue was a line at fixation, directing observers to attend to the location of the upcoming target. The neutral cue was a dot at the center of the screen, which gave no information about the upcoming target location. The display duration of the cue + adapter varied from 50 ms to 16s. After a brief blank interval (interstimulus interval, ISI), the target stimulus appeared-a grating similar to the adapter, tilted ±3° from the vertical. Observers performed a two-alternative forced-choice orientation discrimination task. To equate location uncertainty between the precued and neutral conditions, we presented a cue at the center of the screen in both conditions; this indicated the target location and appeared simultaneously with the target. Contrast thresholds for the target stimulus were obtained at 75% accuracy using a staircase procedure. Nine thresholds were obtained per condition. To ensure observers' uninterrupted fixation, eye movements were monitored by infrared camera. We discarded those (rare) trials in which breaks from fixation were detected (< 1%). How unattended adapters are affected over time. (a) Contrast thresholds at the 300-ms adaptation duration for the valid, neutral and invalid cue conditions. For all observers, thresholds were lowest with the valid cue (attended) and highest with the invalid cue (unattended). (b) At 6 s, the pattern was reversed: thresholds were highest with the valid cue (attended) and lowest with the invalid cue (unattended). (c) Attentional cost/benefit ratios (neutral/cued) as a function of time. Points falling on the line y = 1 indicate no effect of attention, points above this line indicate a benefit, and those below it indicate a cost. For all three observers, at 300 ms the valid cue (attended) yielded a benefit (ratio > 1) and the invalid cue (unattended) yielded a cost (ratio < 1). At 6 s, the pattern was reversed: the valid cue led to a cost in contrast sensitivity (ratio < 1) and the invalid cue led to a benefit (ratio > 1). Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2.The effect of sustained attention over time. (a) Contrast thresholds as a function of time. In the neutral condition (dashed line), thresholds increased with time due to contrast adaptation. However, with sustained attention (solid line), thresholds first decreased and then increased. A within-subjects two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the log-transformed thresholds revealed a main effect of duration (F 1,517 = 10.62, P < 0.0001) and an attention × duration interaction (F 1,517 = 4.01, P < 0.0001). Error bars correspond to s.e.m. (b) Attentional cost/ benefit ratios (neutral/attended) as a function of time. Points falling on the line y = 1 indicate no effect, points above this line indicate a benefit, and points below it indicate a cost. For all three observers, there was an initial attentional benefit and a subsequent cost over time. Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3. Acknowledgements We would like to thank T.

O scillatory neuronal activity is a common phenomenon in mammalian neocortex and can be readily observed in local field potential (LFP) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals 1 . Oscillations occur across a broad range of frequencies including slow (0.5-8 Hz) delta/theta and highfrequency gamma band (30-80 Hz) oscillations 2 . How oscillatory brain activity is generated and controlled, particularly in the low (delta, 0.5-4 Hz)-frequency range, and how oscillations relate to behaviour are only partially understood 3 . Neocortical neuronal oscillations in the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) are believed to be generated by mechanisms involving both neocortical and thalamic neuronal circuits 4, 5 and are commonly associated with slow-wave sleep in both humans and animals. However, delta band oscillatory activity in LFP and spike activities was also observed in the whisker barrel cortex of awake, head-fixed mice [6] [7] [8] . At rest, mice breathe rhythmically at frequencies between 1 and 3 Hz, which corresponds to the delta frequency range of neuronal oscillations. While it has been shown on a behavioural level that respiration and whisker movements are dynamically phase locked in this frequency band [9] [10] [11] , whether the neuronal rhythm in the barrel cortex is related to respiration has not been investigated. To examine a possible link between barrel cortical delta oscillations in awake mice breathing at resting respiratory rate, we simultaneously measured breathing rhythm and neuronal activity in the whisker barrel cortex of awake head-fixed mice. We found that delta band neuronal oscillations in the whisker barrel cortex were phase locked to the respiratory rhythm and were mostly driven by olfactory bulb activity. Furthermore, phase-amplitude coupling analysis showed that LFP oscillations in the gamma frequency band were amplitude modulated in phase with the respiratory rhythm. Thus, our results demonstrate that respiratory activity directly modulates slow (1-4 Hz), rhythmic neuronal activity in the somatosensory whisker barrel cortex and indirectly modulates gamma band power through phase-amplitude coupling mechanisms. Several studies have linked theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling to sensory, motor and cognitive processes [12] [13] [14] [15] . Our findings thus suggest a possible neuronal mechanism for cross-modal interactions between olfaction and whisker tactile sensation [9] [10] [11] . Effects of olfactory bulbectomy on oscillations. Respirationlocked neuronal activity is known to occur in the rodent olfactory bulb, driven by the activation of olfactory sensory neurons with each breath through the nose 16, 17 . Fontanini et al. 18, 19 have shown that these oscillations can propagate to the olfactory piriform cortex. The average respiratory rate in C57BL/6J mice at rest is 165 breaths min À 1 or 2.75 Hz (ref. 20). Hence, mice breathe at a resting rate that lies within the 1-4 Hz delta frequency range defined for neuronal oscillations 1 . We asked whether respiration-locked neuronal delta band oscillations in the sensory whisker barrel could be driven by olfactory bulb activity. As a first experimental approach, we surgically removed the olfactory bulb (in n ¼ 6) mice. Olfactory bulbectomies eliminated barrel cortical delta band oscillations and the correlation between respiration and LFPs (Fig. 3 ). We quantified this reduction in the locking between respiration and LFP in terms of their coherence at the respiration frequency. This decrease in the LFP-respiration coherence due to bulbectomy corresponds to an average reduction by 91% (Fig. 3 ), hence a highly significant decrease (Po0.001 (two-sides), Mann-Whitney U-test). Results Respiration LFP oscillations related to nasal airflow. To control if other effects not related to respiration were responsible for the loss of coherence between respiration and LFP in bulbectomized mice, we performed tracheotomies in intact, anaesthetized mice (n ¼ 3) to eliminate respiration through the nose. This manipulation selectively prevented activation of the olfactory bulb through nasal airflow while leaving the bulb intact. LFP activity was recorded in the whisker barrel cortex and respiratory activity was monitored through chest movements. In addition, we generated an artificial rhythmic airflow through the nose independent from the spontaneous tracheal respiration (Fig. 4 ). This was performed at three different frequencies of airflow and a controlled volume that mimicked the mouse's resting tidal volume of B0.15 ml (see Method). Frequencies for artificial nasal airflow were chosen to be lower (0.8 Hz), higher (3.2 Hz) or the same (1.6 Hz) as the average spontaneous respiratory rate of the anaesthetized mouse. In tracheotomized mice, the correlation between respiration and barrel cortical LFP activity was weak (Fig. 4b ,d,f, right, green), but the LFP activity was strongly correlated with the rhythmic nasal airflow (Fig. 4b ,d,f, right, black) at all three frequencies tested. The highest correlation between nasal airflow and LFP activity occurred at a 1.6-Hz rhythm of nasal airflow. This could be due to resonance phenomena in cortical principal neurons, which have been shown to possess a preferred subthreshold frequency close to 1.6 Hz (ref. 21). LFP activity follows electrical olfactory bulb stimulation. The rhythmic airflow through the nose might exert small mechanical forces on the olfactory bulb that could cause neuronal responses due to small movements of the brain tissue against the recording electrodes. We therefore performed another control experiment in which we eliminated nasal airflow by performing a tracheotomy, but now modulated neuronal activity in the olfactory bulb through electrical stimulation while recording barrel cortical LFP activity. We used rhythmic electrical stimulation consisting of brief trains of current steps to activate the ipsilateral olfactory bulb at the same frequencies used for the artificial nasal airflow stimulation (0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 Hz) in the previous experiment. These stimuli caused stimulus-locked rhythmic fluctuations of the barrel cortical LFPs (Fig. 5 ), confirming that rhythmic olfactory bulb activity rhythmically modulates neuronal activity in the whisker barrel cortex. Phase-amplitude coupling of gamma and respiratory rhythms. Recent studies suggest that gamma band amplitude or power is modulated in phase with delta band oscillations, a finding referred to as phase-amplitude coupling 14, 15, 22 . Our data also show this type of cross-frequency interaction. We found that the power of gamma oscillations (75 Hz) in the whisker barrel cortex was modulated in phase with the respiratory cycle (Fig. 6 ). Thus, not only slow oscillations but also higher-frequency activities in the whisker barrel cortex are linked to respiration. Such cross-frequency coupling has been implicated in spatial and temporal coordination of neuronal activity associated with higher brain functions 14, 23 . By use of a bootstrap statistical approach, using phase-randomized surrogate data (see Methods) we show that removal of the olfactory bulb eliminated the respiration-related modulation of power around the frequency range of transition from gamma (30-80 Hz) to fast (80-200 Hz) oscillations. The opposite occurred in frequency ranges below and above this band where phase-amplitude coupling was observed after olfactory bulbectomy (Fig. 6 ). Retrograde tracing. The pathway through which respirationlocked neuronal activity reaches the whisker barrel cortex is currently unknown. The large olfactory or piriform cortex in mice is known to show respiration-locked neuronal oscillations 18, 19 and is thus a plausible link in the pathway from the main olfactory bulb to the barrel cortex. To determine whether the whisker barrel cortex receives direct projections from the piriform cortex or other olfaction-related areas, such as the entorhinal cortex, the amygdala or the orbitofrontal cortex 24, 25 , we injected a retrograde tracer (Fluorogold) into the barrel cortex (see Methods). Labelling of forebrain neurons projecting to the whisker barrel cortex was consistent with previous studies (for example, ref. 26). Projection neurons were found in ventral posteromedial thalamus (VPM) and to a lesser extent as well in ventral posterolateral thalamus (VPL). Labelled neurons were also found in several cortical areas, including contralateral barrel cortex, as well as adjacent ipsilateral cortical areas, including secondary somatosensory (S2), entorhinal and insular cortex and rostral motor cortex. In somatosensory cortical areas, projection neurons were predominantly found in layers 2,3 and 5, but not in layers 1 or 4. Sparse, large labelled neurons were found in basal forebrain nuclei-these are likely cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis known to project to multiple cortical areas. Discussion We find that respiration-locked olfactory bulb activity caused by airflow through the nose is a major driving force behind delta band neuronal oscillations in the somatosensory cortex of awake mice. Coherence of cortical neuronal oscillations with respiration was reduced by 91% after removal of the olfactory bulb (Fig. 3 ). Somatosensory cortical oscillations could be directly linked to olfactory bulb activity by experiments involving controlled airflow activation of the bulb in tracheotomized mice (Fig. 4 ) or through electrical stimulation of the bulb (Fig. 5 ). Both manipulations result in the modulation of barrel cortical activity phase locked to the airflow or electrical stimulation. Adrian 27 showed already in 1950 that respiration drives oscillatory spike and LFP activity in the mammalian olfactory bulb. A recent study in rats confirmed that respiration-locked oscillations in the bulb depend on rhythmic airflow through the nose 17 . These oscillations do not require the detection of odours because mammalian olfactory sensory neurons are also mechanical sensors, signalling pressure changes caused by nasal airflow 28 . The influence of respiration-locked olfactory bulb activity on the whisker barrel cortex is not limited to delta band oscillations. Phase-amplitude coupling analysis reveals that the power of gamma band oscillatory activity in the whisker barrel cortex is modulated in phase with respiration-locked delta band activity. An interaction between respiration as a behaviour linked to olfaction and active whisker movements for tactile exploration has been suggested by Welker, based on early behavioural observations in rats 29 . Recent studies confirmed that respiratory and whisker tactile behaviours are coordinated in mice 9 and rats 10 , suggesting a coordinated interaction of olfactory and tactile sensory acquisition. The fact that the two sensory systems are not independent is further supported by studies showing that the loss of one results in increased sensitivity in the other sensory modality 30, 31 . Whisking and breathing movements in mice are dynamically correlated with correlations being particularly strong during slow whisking (o5 Hz) 9 . Thus, during slow whisking, sensory input from the whiskers is likely to contribute to the breathing-LFP coherence in the whisker barrel cortex, in addition to olfactory bulb sensory input. However, the contribution of whisker sensory feedback to breathing-LFP coherence can be no larger than B10% of the maximal coherence, since bulbectomy experiments show that olfactory bulb activity accounts for B90% of LFP-breathing coherence. Since delta band oscillations in cortical activity are also found in mammals who breathe much slower than mice (for example, humans), parallel neuronal mechanisms likely involving thalamocortical circuits exist that generate delta oscillations independent of the respiratory rhythm. Our findings suggest, however, that respiration might cause a rhythmic modulation of somatosensory cortical activity at the species-specific respiratory rates. Removing the olfactory bulb reduces the breathing-LFP coherence at the respiratory frequency by 91%. Thus, in mice olfactory bulb activity was responsible for most of the respiration-locked neuronal oscillations, but other respiration related to sensory inputs, e.g., from the trigeminal nasal airflow sensors, upper airway sensors and chest muscles, are likely to contribute as well. Those could be responsible for the residual respiration-locked modulation observed in bulbectomized mice and would also be present in animals with poor or no sense of olfaction, like dolphins. Our findings provide a potential neuronal mechanism for the interaction between olfactory and whisker tactile sensation in awake-behaving mice. Behavioural studies have shown that the timing of respiratory and whisker movements are dynamically coordinated 9, 11 . The results by Cao et al. 9 suggest that active odour and tactile sensing through sniffing and high-frequency whisking can occur independently in mice , while a study by Deschenes and colleagues suggests continuous strong phase locking between the two rhythms in rats 11 . Gamma oscillations in the barrel cortex of rats have been shown to increase immediately before exploratory whisking behaviour 32 and after mechanical whisker stimulation 33 . Whether these changes in gamma activity were linked to respiration was not addressed in those studies. Our results suggest that the modulation of barrel cortical gamma band power in phase with respiration could play a role in coordinating olfactory and tactile sensory processing. Additional clues about the potential functional role of respiration-locked oscillations in whisker sensory processing might come from a comparative investigation of different species. Rats, gerbils, hamsters and chinchillas, who also have barrel cortices and motile whiskers, also have resting respiratory rates within the delta frequency band (B1.2, 1.4, 0.7 and 0.7 Hz, respectively). On the basis of our findings those species could be expected to show respiration-locked gamma power modulation in the barrel cortex, similar to mice. In contrast, Guniea pigs possess a whisker barrel cortex but have immotile mystacial whiskers and thus lack active whisker-sensing behaviour. If respiration-locked modulations of gamma power does play a role in the coordination of respiration with whisker tactile sensing, it could be less pronounced or even absent in animals without active tactile sensing. In summary, respiration-locked neuronal oscillation in the olfactory bulb is a major driving force behind delta band neuronal oscillations in the somatosensory cortex of mice. Furthermore, gamma band oscillations, which have been widely implicated in higher cortical processing, are amplitude modulated in phase with respiration. Thus, the life supporting respiratory behaviour, believed to be controlled mostly by brain stem centres, has an unexpected, indirect influence on higher-order brain activity in mice, via the olfactory system. Whether similar influences of breathing on brain activity also exist in other cortical areas and possibly also in humans, whose olfactory bulb is much reduced in size relative to the neocortex, remain to be shown. Methods Animals. Experiments were performed on adult male C57BL/6J (B6) mice (48 weeks old, 18-25 g body weight). Male mice were used to avoid variability in behavioural physiological measures related to oestrous cycle. Mice were housed in a breeding colony with 12-hour light/dark cycles in standard cages housing maximally five adult mice with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed during the light cycle (between 1200 and 1700 hours). None of the mice had undergone any previous experimental procedure. All animal experimental procedures adhered to guidelines approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center Animal Care and Use Committee. Principles of laboratory animal care (NIH publication No. 86-23, rev. 1996) were followed. Preparation for awake, head-fixed recording. For surgeries, mice were anaesthetized with 3% Isoflurane (Baxter Pharmaceutical Products, Deerfield IL) in oxygen in an incubation chamber, transferred to a stereotaxic head mount and anaesthesia was continued with 1-2.5% Isoflurane in oxygen through a mouthpiece. Isoflurane concentration was controlled with a vaporizer (Highland Medical Equipment, CA). The depth of anaesthesia was adjusted until the mice failed to show a reflex withdrawal of the hind paw to a strong pinch. Blunt ear bars were used to prevent damaging the eardrums. Core body temperature, measured with a rectal thermometer, was maintained between 36.5 and 38.0 °C with a feedbackcontrolled heating pad (FHC Inc., Bowdoinham, ME). Surgical techniques were described in detail elsewhere 34, 35 . In brief, a small craniotomy (diameter, 1-2 mm) was made over the right whisker barrel cortex 1 mm posterior to Bregma and 3.5 mm lateral to the midline. The exposed but intact dura was covered with Triple Antibiotic (Walgreens, US) to keep it moist and reduce the risk of infection. A cylindrical plastic chamber (0.45 cm diameter and 8 mm height) was placed over the skull opening and filled with Triple Antibiotic. Three small machine screws (1/8 0 dome head, 0.8 mm diameter, 2 mm long, Small Parts, Inc., Miami Lakes, FL) were secured in the skull bone, and metal head post was mounted anterior to Bregma. The chamber, head post and skull screws were secured into place with dental acrylic, as described earlier. Mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 mg kg À 1 analgesic Torbugestic (Fort Doege, USA) to alleviate pain and 0.5 ml of lactated ringer solution as a fluid supplement twice within the first 24 h of the surgery. Electrophysiological recordings and respiration monitoring in awake mice. Mice were allowed a 3-4-day recovery period after surgical mounting of a head post and recording chamber before being adapted to the head-restrained experimental situation during two sessions of head fixation of 15 min duration performed on the same day at 0900 and 1500 hours. During these sessions, the head was held fixed and the body was covered with a loose fitting plastic half-tube (5 cm diameter, 10 cm long) to limit movements. Mice typically adapted to the head fixation within 2-3 sessions as judged by markedly reduced walking and running movements during the third session compared with the first or second. The experimental setup, head-holding device and recording procedures have been described in detail in a technical publication 34 . In short, head fixation involved clamping the metal head post mounted on the mouse's skull to a metal fixation device, using a machine screw. Triple antibiotic paste was then removed from the recording chamber, and the chamber was rinsed and filled with sterile saline solution. Before each experiment, mice were allowed to accommodate to the head fixation situation for 30 min before recordings. For extracellular recordings, the guiding tubes of a computer-controlled microdrive (MiniMatrix, Thomas Recording, Germany) were lowered into the saline-filled recording chamber to a distance of less than 2 mm from the dural surface of the brain. The stainless steel guiding tubes also serve as reference electrodes and are eclectically connected to the brain tissue via the saline solution. Then, 2-5 electrodes (glass insulated tungsten/platinum, impedance: 3.5-5.0 MO) were slowly advanced through the intact dura into the whisker barrel cortex. Electrode movements were controlled with micrometre resolution and digitally monitored. Local field potentials and spike signals were separated by bandpass filtering at 0.1 to 200 Hz and at 200 Hz to 8 kHz, respectively, using a hardware filter amplifier (FA32; Multi Channel Systems). Filtered and amplified voltage signals were digitized and stored on a computer hard disk (16 bit A/D converter; sampling rate, 420 kHz for action potentials, 41 kHz for LFPs) using a CED power1401 and Spike2 software (both Cambridge Electronic Design). Respiratory behaviour was monitored based on temperature changes associated with the expiration of warm air. A thermistor (Measurement Specialties, Boston, MA, USA) was placed in front of one nostril (or descending trachea in some tracheotomy experiments), and breathing cycles could reliably be measured as temperature increased and decreased during exhale and inhale movements, respectively. Increased temperature is represented as positive deflections of the thermistor voltage signal, which thus correspond to exhale movements (Figs 1, 2 ). The raw thermistor voltage signal was digitized at 1 kHz and stored together with the electrophysiological signals. On completion of each recording session, the Ringer's solution was removed, the recording chamber filled with triple antibiotic and the mice were returned to their home cages. Each animal typically participated in experiments for 1-2 weeks. Tracheotomy and nasal airflow control. To further investigate the question whether neuronal activity was locked to respiration as a motor act or to nasal airflow and hence olfactory bulb activation, we opened the trachea in anaesthetized mice to separate respiration from nasal airflow. While the mouse could breathe spontaneously through the descending trachea, we were able to independently modulate nasal airflow by moving air through the ascending trachea. For the performance of a tracheotomy before electrophysiological recordings, mice (n ¼ 3) were anaesthetized with Avertin (400 mg kg À 1 ). After completion of the tracheotomy, anaesthesia was continued with 1-2% Isoflurane in oxygen inhaled through the opening of the descending trachea. Spontaneous respiration was monitored using a piezo film touching the chest wall. The ascending trachea was connected to a Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA) to modulate nasal airflow by passing air (mimicking a B0.15 ml tidal volume) into the trachea. Nasal airflow was modulated rhythmically to be half, the same and double the spontaneous respiration frequency (1.6 Hz). Nasal airflow was modulated at 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 Hz and was monitored using a thermistor placed in front of the nostril as described in detail below. Electrical stimulation of olfactory bulb. To investigate whether local field potential activity in the whisker barrel cortex could be modulated by electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb in the absence of nasal airflow, we performed experiments in anaesthetized, tracheomotized mice (n ¼ 3). A tracheotomy was performed under Avertin anaesthesia to eliminate nasal airflow and thus respiration-related bulbar activity. Anaesthesia was then continued using Isoflurane inhaled through the pulmonary trachea. Mice were mounted in a stereotaxic frame, and the skull was opened above the right whisker barrel cortex and olfactory bulb. Recording electrodes were inserted into the whisker barrel cortex. A concentric bipolar stimulation electrode was lowered onto the intact dura of the olfactory bulb. We electrically stimulated the bulb with rhythmic stimulation patterns consisting of 50 Hz trains of stimuli with inter-train intervals of 1.25, 0.62 and 0.28 s, corresponding to stimulation rhythms of 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 Hz, respectively. Stimulus trains consisted of 10-ms current steps using 50 or 80 mA stimulus currents. We kept the train frequency and step duration constant while changing the number of pulses to generate different stimulation frequencies. The stimulus trains had 30, 15 and 8 current steps for 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 Hz stimulation rhythms, respectively. Creation of hypoxic conditions. We increased the frequency of respiratory activity by exposing the mice for 1 min to hypoxic (B10% oxygen) air while continuously recording the local field potentials. To this end, a custom-designed plastic cover was placed over the mouse leaving access to the recording chamber and head post through an opening at the top. Respiratory behaviour was monitored with a thermistor as described above. The composition of the air in the chamber was controlled by mixing atmospheric air with nitrogen at a ratio of 1/0 for normoxic and 1/2 for hypoxic conditions. Gas flowed into the chamber at a rate of 1 l min À 1 . An O 2 analyser (GB-300, Teledyne Anal. Instr., City of Industry, CA, USA) continuously monitored the O 2 concentration in the chamber. Following at least 5 min of stable LFP recording, mice were exposed to hypoxic air (10% O 2 ) for 1 min, followed by normoxic air. Respiratory frequency, blood O 2 saturation and heart rate were measured using a MouseOx (Starr Life Sci.Corp. Pittsburgh, USA) and recorded together with electrophysiological data before, during and after exposure to hypoxic air. Analysis of local field potentials. LFP data were collected in awake, head-fixed conditions from five intact and six olfactory bulbectomized mice. Primary analysis involved identification of the correlation of the LFP activity to the respiratory activity and the frequency of the resting respiratory rhythm. Periods of stable resting respiratory rhythm (o5 Hz) were selected for further analysis. Coherence analysis focused on the resting respiratory frequency range (1-3 Hz) only, excluding higher respiratory rates associated with the brief episodes of sniffing. Cross-correlations were calculated for each pair of simultaneously recorded respiratory and LFP signals, as well as the autocorrelation of each of the signals (Fig. 1 ). The respiratory frequency was identified as the peak frequency of the power spectrum calculated from the respiratory signal after a bandpass filtering between 0.5 and 10 Hz (the 4th order Butterworth filter). Phase locking between the respiratory rhythm or nasal airflow and the LFP oscillations was assessed by computing the coherence between the two signals. The coherency spectrum was estimated in the following manner: 50-s segments of resting respiration and LFP signals served for the estimation of respiration-LFP coherence. Each of these segments were further segmented in 19 subsegments of 5 s duration with 2.5 s overlap. For each of those subsegments, we calculated the autospectrum separately of each signals and the cross-spectra of the respiration-LFP signals. The auto-and cross-spectra were averaged over the 50-s segment, and the average cross-spectrum was normalized by the square roots of the average autospectra of the respiration and LFP signals. To compare the degrees of the respiration-LFP coherence in normal and bulbectomized mice, we took from each coherency spectrum the coherence value at the corresponding respiration frequency and tested for the significance of the difference in the coherence values for the two groups with the Mann-Whitney U-test. When we performed the coherence analysis in a time-resolved manner, we sampled consecutive 10-s segments of 9-s overlaps (that is, shifts in steps of 1 s) and applied the abovementioned coherence spectrum estimation to each of the 10-s segments with 1-s subsegments of 0.5-s overlaps. To study cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling of the LFP activity, we extracted from the LFP recordings the oscillatory phase f fp ðtÞ and amplitude A fa ðtÞ at time t and at two different frequencies, respectively, that is, phase frequency f p and amplitude frequency f a . For this extraction, we used the wavelet transform with a Morlet wavelet defined at time t and frequency f as ffiffi ffi f p Á exp½i2pf ðu À tÞ exp À ðu À tÞ 2 = 2s 2 ð Þ Â Ã . The parameter s was set to 10/(6f) so that the wavelet contains about 10 cycles of oscillations. The obtained amplitude was divided by its mean so that the absolute amplitude value, which depends on the frequency, does not affect the results of the forthcoming phase-amplitude coupling analysis. The degree of the phase-amplitude coupling between the frequencies f a and f p was measured with the mean vector length MVL ¼ 1 T R T 0 X fa;fp ðtÞdt (Equation (1)), where T is the duration of the signal and X f a ,f p is the composite signal defined as X fa;fp ðtÞ A fa ðtÞ exp if fp ðtÞ h i (Equation ( 2 )). The phase frequency f p was fixed to the breathing frequency, estimated as the peak frequency of the power spectrum of the respiratory signal. The amplitude frequency f a was varied in a range of frequencies between 1 and 256 Hz, sampled evenly on a logarithmic scale. To test the significance of the mean vector length, 1,000 phase-randomized surrogates were generated from the original signal by applying random phase shift to every Fourier coefficient of the original signal in the frequency domain and then inverse-Fourier transforming the randomized signal back into the time domain. The mean vector length was computed for each of them in exactly the same manner as for the original signal. The original mean vector length was considered to be significantly high if it exceeded the 95 percentile of the surrogate mean vector lengths. The mean vector length was computed for 50-s segments of the recordings sampled from artefact-free periods. For each of the normal mice, 2-3 samples of such artefact-free segments were obtained. For each of the bulbectomized mice, one segment of 50-s was taken. Analysis of spiking activity. In two awake, head-fixed mice, we recorded spiking activity in the whisker barrel cortices while also monitoring respiratory behaviour. Spiking activity was recorded at a total of 12 sites, six in each mouse. Spike events were extracted using a fixed threshold. If the signal to noise ratio of a spike signal was larger than four and the inter-spike intervals had a gamma distribution with a refractory period 45 ms we regarded it as a single unit (n ¼ 3). All other spike trains were regarded as multi-unit signals (n ¼ 9). The spike trains were convolved with a Gaussian of unit area and s ¼ 2.5 ms, and the resulting function was correlated with the respiratory signal (that is, the thermistor voltage output). To determine the significance of spike-respiration correlations, we generated surrogate correlations by randomly shifting the spike train in time relative to the respiratory times. The spike train could be shifted in time by any random value between 0 s and the full duration of the recording. All spike times were shifted by the same value, preserving the spike interval sequence. The process was repeated 100 times, each time calculating the correlation of the shifted spike trains and saving the correlation values. From these 100 surrogate correlations, we calculated the median and the 5th and 95th percentile of the distributions of correlation coefficients at each lag time. Correlations were considered significant if the raw correlation coefficient values exceeded the 5th or 95th percentile of the surrogate distributions (Fig. 2 ). Tracing studies. Five mice were anaesthetized (i.p. injection) with Ketamine/ Xylazine (100/10 ml kg À 1 ) and positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA). The scalp was opened with a midline incision, and the skull was levelled between bregma and lambda by adjusting the bite bar. Body temperature was maintained at 35 °C using a heating pad. A glass micropipette filled with 5% Fluorogold (FG; Fluorochrome, LLC, Denver, CO, USA) was lowered into barrel cortex (anteroposterior ¼ À 1.0 mm, mediolateral ¼ 3.8 mm, dorsoventral ¼ À 0.3 mm), and the tracer was injected via iontophoresis (Precision Current Source, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA), at 2 mA (cycle 8 s ON and 8 s OFF), for a total of 20 min. The injection pipette was left in place for 10 min before and after the injection. Supplemental anaesthetic was administered as necessary throughout the surgery to maintain the animals under deep anaesthesia. After a 5-day survival period, mice were perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 day and then transferred to a 30% buffered sucrose solution and stored at 4 °C for at least 1 week. Coronal sections (40 mm, every other section) were cut serially using a freezing microtome. FG can be visualized using fluorescent microscopy, so no further histological processing was necessary. Sections were rinsed, mounted, air-dried and coverslipped on salinecoated slides with DPX mounting media for histology. All material were visualized and imaged using a Leica (DMRXA2, Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL, USA) episcopic-fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu , Shizuoka, Japan) and imaging software (SimplePCI, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) (Fig. 7 ).

Simultaneously, respiratory activity was monitored non-invasively by measuring the air temperature fluctuations in front of the nostrils (see Methods). LFP as well as single-and multi-unit spike activity were rhythmically correlated with respiration (Figs 1,2). Figure 2 | 2 Figure 2 | Spike activity is rhythmically correlated with respiration.

and intensity variations that originate from the statistics of natural scenes and from the tuning of sensory receptors 1 . This statistical structure complicates the classification of sensory inputs because it does not usually reflect behaviorally relevant stimulus categories 2 . For example, visual scenes may be dominated by a large number of pixels representing sky while the biologically most important information is conveyed by a small subset of pixels representing specific objects (e.g., a hawk or a sparrow). Hence, correlations in sensory inputs can complicate meaningful pattern classification and object recognition. This problem can be alleviated by whitening, a fundamental transformation in signal processing that decorrelates patterns and normalizes their variance. Whitening is therefore often used early in a pattern classification process to remove undesired correlations and to optimize the use of coding space 3 . In the visual and auditory systems, whitening of individual neurons' responses to natural stimuli supports efficient coding by redundancy reduction [4] [5] [6] [7] . Efficient pattern classification, however, requires whitening of activity patterns across neuronal populations. This form of whitening occurs in the olfactory bulb (OB) [8] [9] [10] where axons of olfactory sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor converge onto discrete glomeruli. Odors evoke distributed patterns of input activity across glomeruli that can overlap substantially when odorants share functional groups [11] [12] [13] . The variance (contrast) of these glomerular activity patterns varies dramatically as a function of odor concentration. The output of the OB is transmitted to higher brain areas by mitral cells (MCs), which receive sensory input from individual glomeruli and interact with other MCs cells via multisynaptic interneuron (IN) pathways (Fig. 1a ). Unlike glomerular inputs, activity patterns across MCs become rapidly decorrelated during the initial phase of an odor response 8, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and their variance depends only modestly on stimulus intensity 10, 19 . Neuronal circuits in the OB therefore decorrelate and normalize population activity patterns, resulting in a whitening of odor representations. Pattern decorrelation predicted learning in odor discrimination tasks 9, 16 , consistent with the assumption that whitening facilitates pattern classification. However, it remains unclear how this transformation is achieved by interactions between neurons in the OB network. Efficient whitening can be achieved by transformations that are adapted to the correlation structure of input patterns 1 . Such adaptive whitening requires prior knowledge about inputs and tuning-dependent connectivity between specific cohorts of neurons. Hence, whitening of sensory representations is thought to depend on an evolutionary memory of stimulus space that is contained in the wiring diagram of neuronal circuits. This hypothesis is difficult to test in the OB because tuning and functional connectivity cannot be inferred from topographical relationships between neurons 11, [20] [21] [22] . Moreover, because interactions between MCs are multisynaptic via INs, relevant inhibitory interactions cannot be visualized by transsynaptic tracing across a single synapse. Adaptive whitening and other memory-based processes are likely to depend on higher-order features of neuronal connectivity that cannot be detected by sparse sampling of pairwise connections. We therefore used a "functional connectomics" approach that combines population-wide neuronal activity measurements with dense reconstructions of wiring diagrams, taking advantage of the small size of the larval zebrafish brain. We first measured odor responses of neurons in the OB by multiphoton calcium imaging and subsequently reconstructed the synaptic connectivity among all neurons by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) [23] [24] [25] [26] . We found that higher-order features of multisynaptic connectivity specifically suppress the activity of correlated MC ensembles in a stimulusdependent manner, resulting in a decorrelation and variance normalization. The wiring diagram of the OB is therefore adapted to the correlation structure of its inputs and mediates a whitening operation based on contrast reduction rather than contrast enhancement. Results Reconstruction of the wiring diagram and mapping of neuronal activity We previously reconstructed the skeletons of 1'003 neurons in an SBEM image stack of the OB from a zebrafish larva (4.5 days post fertilization), accounting for 98% of all neurons in the OB, and classified them as MCs (n = 745), INs (n = 254) and "atypical projection neurons" (n = 4) 25, 26 . We now annotated the synaptic connections of these neurons to reconstruct the full wiring diagram of the OB. Human annotators followed each of the reconstructed skeletons and manually labeled all input and output synapses (Fig. 1b, c ). Subsequently, synapses of INs were annotated again by different annotators. Hence, each synapse involved in MC-IN-MC connectivity motifs should have been encountered at least three times. To obtain a conservative estimate of the wiring diagram with few false positives we retained only those synapses that were annotated at least twice by independent annotators. Each synapse was assigned a unitary weight so that the total connection strength between a pair of neurons equaled the number of synapses. The resulting wiring diagram contained 19,874 MC→IN synapses, 17,524 MC←IN synapses (Fig. 1d ), and 13,610 synapses between INs. We also observed contact sites between MCs associated with the same glomerulus where plasma membranes showed strong staining but these sites usually lacked vesicles. We did therefore not consider synaptic connections between MCs. Axons of sensory neurons frequently made synapses onto MCs but synapses onto INs were rare (Extended Data Fig. 1a ) 26 . On average, connected pairs of MCs and INs made 3.1 MC→IN synapses and 2.9 MC←IN synapses per pair, and pairs of connected INs made 2.6 synapses per direction. A hallmark of synaptic connectivity in the adult OB are reciprocal dendrodendritic synaptic connections between the same MC-IN pair. In the larval OB, 52% of MC→IN synapses and 51% of MC←IN synapses were associated with a synapse of opposite direction, usually within 2.5 μm, between the same pair of neurons (Fig. 1b ). Hence, reciprocal synaptic connectivity is prominent already in the larval OB of zebrafish. Prior to preparation of the OB sample for SBEM we measured neuronal activity by multiphoton imaging of the calcium indicator GCaMP5, which was expressed under the panneuronal elavl3 promoter 27 . Somata observed in electron microscopy were mapped onto the light microscopy data using an iterative landmark-based affine alignment procedure followed by manual proofreading (Fig. 2a, b ; Extended Data Fig. 1b ). Somatic calcium signals evoked by four amino acid odors (10 -4 M) and four bile acid odors (10 -5 M) were measured sequentially in six optical planes (Fig. 2a-c ; Extended Data Fig. 2 ) and temporally deconvolved to estimate odor-evoked firing rate changes 28 . The dynamics of neuronal population activity was then represented by time series of activity vectors for each odor stimulus (232 MCs and 68 INs). Decorrelation and contrast normalization of activity patterns across MCs have been characterized previously in the OB of adult zebrafish 8, 14, 15 and mice [16] [17] [18] where >90% of neurons are GABAergic INs. In the larval OB, in contrast, INs account for only 25% of all neurons 26 . Most of these INs are likely to be periglomerular and short axon cells because INs with the typical morphology of granule cells appear only later in development. We therefore asked whether the core circuitry present in the larval OB already performs computations related to whitening. Correlations between activity patterns evoked by different bile acids were high after stimulus onset and decreased during the subsequent few hundred milliseconds (Fig. 2d, e ). Patterns evoked by amino acids, in contrast, were less correlated throughout the odor response, which was expected because most amino acids had dissimilar side chains. Further analyses of pattern decorrelation therefore focused on activity patterns evoked by the four bile acids while other analyses included all eight odors. To quantify pattern decorrelation we computed the mean difference in pairwise Pearson correlations between a time window shortly after response onset (t 1 ) and a later time window (t 2 ) that was chosen so that the mean population activity across MCs was not significantly different from t 1 (Fig. 2d ; p = 0.57, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Pattern correlations across MCs, however, were significantly lower at t 2 than at t 1 (p = 0.03, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), demonstrating that MC activity patterns were reorganized and decorrelated. Activity across INs followed the mean MC activity with a small delay and did not exhibit an obvious decorrelation during the early phase of the odor response (Fig. 2d ). These findings are consistent with observations in the adult OB 29 . The natural time course of olfactory input to the OB of zebrafish larvae is likely to be slow because animals live in slow waters close to the substratum 30 and because the temporal resolution of their olfactory sensory neurons is low 31 . We therefore assume that the dynamics of odor-evoked population activity in the OB is fast compared to the kinetics of natural sensory inputs. The contrast of MC activity patterns, as measured by the variance of activity across the population, increased shortly after stimulus onset and peaked slightly later than pattern correlation. Subsequently, variance decreased and became more uniform across odors, as reflected by a significant decrease in the standard deviation (s.d.) of the variance across odors between t 2 and t 1 (Fig. 2d ; p = 0.003, F-test; t 1 was slightly shifted relative to the time window for correlation analysis to cover the peak of the variance). Hence, MC activity patterns in the larval OB became decorrelated and contrast-normalized, consistent with the whitening of odor representations in the adult OB. Whitening can facilitate pattern classification but may also introduce noise. We therefore quantifed the reliability of odor classification using a template matching procedure based on single-trial responses and found that classification success, as well as the separation of correct and incorrect classifications, were slightly higher at t 2 than at t 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3 ). Hence, pattern decorrelation did not compromise the reliability of odor identification by a simple classifier but facilitated pattern separation. Computational consequences of connectivity While contrast normalization can be achieved by global scaling operations such as divisive normalization 32 , pattern decorrelation requires interactions between distinct subsets of neurons 9 . In theory, pattern decorrelation could be achieved by large networks with sparse and random connectivity 33 but this architecture is inconsistent with the low number of INs in the larval OB. Smaller networks can decorrelate specific input patterns when their connectivity is adapted to the covariance structure of these inputs, suggesting that decorrelation in the OB is an input-specific transformation of odor representations that is encoded in the wiring diagram. In order to explore this hypothesis we first asked whether whitening can be reproduced by implementing the wiring diagram in a network of minimally complex single-neuron models (Fig. 3a ). We first simulated a network of threshold-linear rate neurons with 208 MCs, representing all recorded MCs with input and output synapses, and 234 INs, representing all connected INs. Connections between individual neurons were given by the wiring diagram. Excitatory sensory input into MCs was defined by the odor-evoked activity pattern at t 1 . INs received no sensory input because synapses from sensory neurons onto INs were rare (Extended Data Fig. 1a ). All connections made by neurons of the same type (MC or IN) had the same weight scaling. The time course of stimuli consisted of a fast initial rise followed by a slow decay 33 , approximating the response time course of olfactory sensory neurons in zebrafish 8 . Because connectivity was fixed, the final network model had only six degrees of freedom (thresholds, synaptic weight scaling factors and time constants of each neuron type). Correlations between simulated population responses to bile acids increased rapidly and subsequently decreased. Consistent with experimental observations, the mean correlation decreased significantly between two time windows t 1 and t 2 that were chosen so that the mean activity was not significantly different (Fig. 3b ). The variance (contrast) of activity patterns and its standard deviation across stimuli peaked slightly later than the correlation and decreased thereafter (Fig. 3b ). Correlations between IN activity patterns remained higher than correlations between MC activity patterns throughout the odor response (Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Hence, simulation results were in good agreement with experimental observations. 3b ). IN-IN connectivity was therefore omitted in further simulations for simplicity (Fig. 3c ). To exclude the possibility that pattern decorrelation by simulated networks reflects a chaotic process we examined responses to inputs with biologically realistic amounts of noise (Methods). While activity patterns representing different odors became decorrelated, correlations between noisy representations of the same stimuli remained high (Extended Data Fig. 4b ), demonstrating that pattern decorrelation did not reflect an amplification of noise. Randomizing the wiring diagram by independent shufflings of the feed-forward connectivity matrix W MC→IN and the feedback connectivity matrix W MC←IN abolished pattern decorrelation and contrast normalization (Fig. 3d, e ). Hence, whitening depended on the wiring diagram. To corroborate this conclusion we examined whether the reorganization of activity patterns underlying whitening can be predicted from connectivity without an explicit simulation of network dynamics. Activity patterns at t 1 were multiplied with the feedforward connectivity W MC→IN , normalized, and thresholded to generate a hypothetical pattern of IN activity. This activity pattern was then multiplied with the feed-back connectivity W MC←IN to predict the pattern of feedback inhibition onto MCs. The feedback pattern was either subtracted from the MC activity at t 1 (subtractive inhibition), or the MC activity pattern at t 1 was divided by the pattern of feedback inhibition neuron-by-neuron (divisive inhibition; Extended Data Fig. 5a ). This simple algebraic procedure reproduced both pattern decorrelation and variance normalization, independent of whether inhibition was subtractive or divisive (Extended Data Fig. 5b ). Whitening was again abolished when connectivity matrices were randomized. These results confirm that the wiring diagram contains information essential for whitening. We next performed more specific manipulations to explore how whitening depends on higher-order structure in the wiring diagram. In simulations without IN-IN connections, we first applied the same shufflings to MC→IN connections (W MC→IN ) and to MC←IN connectivity (W MC←IN ). This co-permutation of feed-forward and feedback connectivity shuffles the off-diagonal elements in the disynaptic connectivity matrix (lateral inhibition) but preserves the overall distribution of disynaptic MC→IN→MC connection strengths and the on-diagonal elements (self-inhibition; Fig. 3f ). Similar to the independent randomization of W MC→IN and W MC←IN , co-permutation of W MC→IN and W MC←IN abolished whitening (Fig. 3d, e ). Moreover, whitening was abolished when input channels were permuted to produce novel input patterns with the same statistical properties and correlations (Fig. 3e ). These results show that whitening is mediated by higher-order features of multisynaptic connectivity that are adapted to patterns of sensory input. Higher-order structure of connectivity The shortest synaptic path between two MCs associated with different glomeruli is a disynaptic interaction via one IN (MC-IN-MC). To identify properties of the wiring diagram that mediate whitening we therefore analyzed MC-IN-MC triplets. There are seven possible triplet configurations that represent four topological motifs (Fig. 4a ). We found that the motif containing no reciprocal connection (motif 1) was underrepresented whereas the other motifs were overrepresented in comparison to randomized networks (Fig 4b ). The strongest overrepresentation was observed for motif 4, which contains reciprocal connections between both MCs and the IN. Hence, MC-IN-MC triplets frequently contained reciprocal connections. To determine whether disynaptic connectivity between MCs depends on their tuning we constructed an input tuning curve for each MC from the responses to the eight odors at t 1 . We then quantified the Pearson correlation between the input tuning curves of MC pairs and the number of disynaptic MC-IN-MC connection paths across all motifs. The mean number of disynaptic connections increased with the input tuning correlation (Fig. 4c , left). MCs with similar tuning were more likely to be connected through motifs with reciprocal connections, particularly motifs 2 and 4 (Fig. 4d ; Extended Data Fig. 6 ). Consistent with this observation, the correlation between tuning similarity and disynaptic connectivity of MC pairs remained strong when only reciprocal connections were considered (Fig. 4c , right). Hence, triplets mediate interactions preferentially between MCs with similar tuning, and these interactions frequently contain reciprocal connections. As for MC-IN-MC connections, motifs with one or two reciprocal connections were also overrepresented in IN-MC-IN triplets but no simple relationship was apparent between input tuning and disynaptic IN-MC-IN connectivity (Extended Data Fig. 7a-c ). In addition, we found that the tuning of synaptic inputs and outputs of individual INs was significantly correlated and that large sets of fully reciprocally connected neurons ("maximal cliques") were strongly overrepresented in the wiring diagram (Extended Data Fig. 7d-g ). These observations further demonstrate that the connectivity among OB neurons is not random but governed, at least in part, by functional response properties. Mechanism of whitening Unidirectional lateral inhibition between functionally related neurons sharpens tuning curves and enhances pattern contrast in the retina 34 and elsewhere (Fig. 5a , left). In idealized networks with reciprocal connectivity, in contrast, inhibition does not amplify asymmetries in inputs and self-inhibition is usually stronger than lateral inhibition (assuming equal synaptic strength; Fig. 5a, right ). Hence, reciprocal triplet connectivity should primarily down-regulate, rather than sharpen, the activity of neurons in connected cohorts. As illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 8 , computational effects of contrast enhancement (by unidirectional connectivity) or suppression of cohorts (by partially reciprocal connectivity) depend on the properties of input patterns. Contrast enhancement can decorrelate inputs when stimulus-specific information is contained in strong responses because strong responses are emphasized while weak responses are suppressed 4, 34 . However, when strong responses are non-specific, contrast enhancement fails to decorrelate patterns because it enhances non-informative responses while suppressing weaker, potentially informative responses. Under these conditions, patterns may be decorrelated by the selective suppression of strongly active cohorts, which can, in principle, be achieved by cohort-specific reciprocal inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 8 ). To examine the basis of pattern correlations in the OB we analyzed population activity patterns evoked by bile acids at t 1 . For each pair of patterns, we quantified the contribution r i,t1 of MC i to the Pearson correlation r and ranked MCs by their r i,t1 (see example in Fig. 5b ; rankings differed between odor pairs). Ranked measurements of correlation contribution, activity and variance contribution of individual MCs were then averaged over odor pairs (Fig. 5c ). For each odor pair, pattern correlations at t 1 were dominated by high contributions from a small fraction of MCs that were also strongly active (Fig. 5c , center and left). Hence, correlated odor representations overlapped primarily in strongly responsive MCs at t 1 , consistent with observations in the adult OB 9 . We then examined the changes in the activity of individual neurons underlying the decorrelation and contrast normalization between t 1 and t 2 . The activity of MCs with large r i,t1 was significantly lower at t 2 than at t 1 (Fig. 5b, c ). The mean activity of MCs that did not strongly contribute to the initial correlation, in contrast, remained similar. As a consequence, the contribution of MCs with large r i,t1 to the overall correlation decreased, resulting in a substantial decorrelation of population activity patterns between t 1 and t 2 . Pattern decorrelation can therefore be attributed, at least in part, to the selective inhibition of MC cohorts that dominated the initial pattern correlations. MCs with high r i,t1 also made strong contributions to pattern variance at t 1 (Fig. 5c ) because their activity was substantially higher than the population mean. Because the selective inhibition of these cohorts between t 1 and t 2 changed the activity of these MCs towards the population mean, the inhibition of these MCs also decreased pattern variance and its s.d. across odors. Pattern decorrelation and contrast normalization can therefore be attributed to a common mechanism that targets inhibition to specific MC cohorts and results in contrast reduction rather than contrast enhancement. The selective suppression of activity in cohorts of co-responsive MCs cannot be achieved by global changes in subtractive or divisive inhibition because inhibition within cohorts needs to be stronger than the mean inhibition across the population in response to defined sets of odors. To explore how such stimulus-and ensemble-specific inhibition is generated by specific wiring we defined functional cohorts of MCs for each pair of bile acid stimuli as the 10 MCs with the highest r i,t1 (Extended Data Fig. 9a ). We then determined the disynaptic MC inputs to these cohorts by retrograde tracing through the wiring diagram across two synapses. Inputs to MCs within a cohort were strongly biased towards MCs of the same cohort (Fig. 5d, e ). Consistent with this finding, the density of MC-IN-MC triplets, particularly motifs 2 and 4, was significantly higher within cohorts than among randomly chosen MC subsets (Extended Data Fig. 9b ). Hence, cohorts of MCs are not only functional ensembles defined by similar initial responses but also anatomical ensembles with a high density of disynaptic MC-IN-MC connections. The dense disynaptic connectivity implies that MCs in a cohort will be strongly inhibited when the cohort is activated as a whole. Indeed, the activity of MC and the associated presynaptic INs in a cohort evolved in opposite directions during an odor response (Extended Data Fig. 9c ). As a consequence of cohort-specific connectivity, inhibition of MCs within a cohort will be stronger than the mean level of inhibition. The specific suppression of activity underlying whitening can thus be attributed to dense reciprocal connectivity within cohorts that are activated by specific sets of odors. Cohorts therefore function as "feature detectors", where a "feature" is a molecular stimulus property that efficiently activates many MCs in the ensemble. When a feature is present, the activity of the corresponding MC cohort is down-regulated by feedback inhibition and the representation of the feature in population activity patterns is suppressed, which reduces correlations between related patterns. Pattern decorrelation can therefore be explained by a mechanism that involves "feature suppression" through specific connectivity. Features may correspond to functional groups that promote high correlations of afferent activity patterns because they activate overlapping sets of odorant receptors. This hypothesis predicts that MCs within functional cohorts exhibit similar input tuning to suppress the representation of such features. Indeed, the mean correlation between tuning curves of MCs at t 1 was significantly higher within cohorts (r = 0.56 ± 0.40; mean ± s.d.) than across all MCs (r = 0.01 ± 0.38; p < 10 -84 ; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Feature suppression decreases pattern correlations by the selective inhibition of MCs with high activity and large contributions to initial correlations. To confirm that this mechanism can account for whitening in the OB we set the activity of MCs in functional cohorts (10 MCs with the highest r i,t1 pair at t 1 ) to the population mean for each odor pair. As predicted, this "targeted suppression" of functional cohorts resulted in decorrelation and variance normalization (Extended Data Fig. 5b ). To further dissect the mechanism of feature suppression we took advantage of simulations. We first ranked simulated MCs by their r i,t1 for bile acid-evoked activity patterns in experiments (same ranking as in Fig. 5c ). As observed experimentally, simulated MCs with large r i,t1 were strongly inhibited between t 1 and t 2 while the mean activity of other MCs remained unchanged (Fig. 6a ). Direct analysis of inhibitory inputs to individual MCs confirmed that MCs with large r i,t1 received substantially more inhibition than other MCs. This specific targeting of inhibition to MCs with large r i,t1 was abolished when connectivity was randomized (Fig. 6b ). Simulations therefore precisely reproduced the activity changes in individual neurons that resulted in whitening, implying that simulations recapitulated the underlying mechanism. Moreover, these results further show that decorrelation and whitening of inputs cannot be achieved by global inhibition but rely on interactions among specific subsets of neurons. We next performed selective manipulations of the wiring diagram. We first selected the MCs with the highest r i,t1 for each pair of bile acid stimuli (MC cohorts; 19 MCs in total; Extended Data Fig. 9a ) and deleted their connections onto INs (11% of all MC→IN connections; Fig. 6c , "selective deletion"). As a control, we deleted the same fraction of feedforward connections of random subsets of MCs. While random deletions had almost no effect, the selective deletion of feed-forward connections from MC cohorts abolished pattern decorrelation and variance normalization (Fig. 6d, e ). Ranking of MCs by their r i,t1 in experimental data demonstrated that the activity of MCs with high r i,t1 was not substantially reduced between t 1 and t 2 when MC→IN connections originating from cohorts were deleted. As a consequence, these MCs continued to make large positive contributions to pattern correlation and variance at t 2 (Fig. 6f ). The selective deletion of MC→IN connections from functional cohorts therefore abolished whitening because it disrupted feature suppression. To corroborate this result we redirected feed-forward connections of MCs within cohorts to randomly selected IN targets, which perturbs the connectivity of cohorts without changing the total number of connections in the network. This manipulation (Fig. 6c "selective permutation") also abolished whitening (Fig. 6d, e ) and eliminated the specific inhibition of MCs with high r i,t1 at t 2 (Fig. 6f ), as observed for the "selective deletion" of connections. Finally, we randomized all connections except for those between the 19 cohort MCs and their IN partners ("selective preservation"; Fig. 6c ). We found that pattern decorrelation remained intact (Fig. 6d, e ), contrary to the loss of decorrelation after full randomization of the wiring diagram (Fig. 3d, e ). Variance normalization was partially reduced, as expected because cohorts were selected based on bile acid but not amino acid patterns. The activity of MCs with high r i,t1 was strongly reduced at t 2 (Fig. 6f ), demonstrating that pattern decorrelation and partial variance normalization were generated by feature suppression. Specific manipulations of the wiring diagram therefore demonstrate that whitening is mediated by disynaptic interactions that suppress the activity of correlation-promoting MC cohorts. Discussion We used a functional connectomics approach in a small vertebrate to explore the mechanism of whitening in the OB. Whitening is a computation related to object classification and associative memory that requires specific transformations of neuronal activity patterns. Such computations are thought to rely on specific wiring diagrams that are adapted to relevant inputs. Consistent with this notion, we found that whitening is achieved by specific multisynaptic interactions that cannot be described by general topographic principles or by the first-order statistics of connectivity between neuron types. Functional connectomics is therefore a promising approach to dissect distributed, memory-based computations underlying higher brain functions. Correlations between input patterns in the OB were dominated by distinct subsets of strongly active input channels. This correlation structure is likely to reflect the co-activation of different odorant receptors by discrete functional groups 12, 13 and implies that input correlations cannot be removed efficiently by contrast enhancement [35] [36] [37] . Pattern decorrelation can also not be explained by the amplification of specific responses through disinhibition because it persisted when IN-IN connections were eliminated. Rather, patterns are decorrelated by the selective inhibition of strongly active, correlation-promoting MC cohorts. Pattern decorrelation is therefore achieved by a mechanism that results in contrast reduction, rather than contrast enhancement, which also supports contrast normalization. The tuning-dependent MC-IN-MC connectivity required for whitening may be established by molecular or by activity-dependent mechanisms. We reconstructed the wiring diagram of a larva at a stage before activity-dependent effects were detected on the morphological development of glomeruli 38 , suggesting that the initial assembly of neuronal connections may rely primarily on molecular cues. Projections of INs are enriched between glomeruli that receive input from odorant receptors of the same families 26 , raising the possibility that glomerular targeting of sensory neurons 39 and INs involve related mechanisms. However, the development of specific connectivity among OB neurons remains to be explored. Lateral inhibition between neurons with similar tuning is often assumed to sharpen tuning curves by amplifying asymmetries in the input. In the OB, however, triplet connections between related MCs are enriched in reciprocal connectivity. Such connectivity results in feedback inhibition that is independent of the precise input pattern and down-scales activity without amplifying asymmetries (Fig. 5a , right). Reciprocally connected MC↔IN↔MC cohorts therefore mediate feature suppression because the inhibitory feedback gain within the cohort is larger than the mean feedback gain when an appropriate feature is present. This mechanism can explain the selective and odor-dependent inhibition of correlation-promoting MC cohorts. Functional connectomics permitted us to test the significance of this mechanism by implementing the wiring diagram in a network of minimally complex model neurons. Simulations included only ~30% of the MC population and did not quantitatively reproduce all details of the measured population activity. Nevertheless, the dynamics that resulted in whitening by feature suppression was preserved, demonstrating that the computational function of the circuit is determined to a large extent by its connectivity. Whitening was robust against input noise and parameter variations, presumably because the essential connectivity exhibits substantial redundancy. Precisely targeted manipulations of the wiring diagram confirmed that feedback inhibition among correlation-promoting MC cohorts was necessary and sufficient to achieve whitening. Hence, whitening in the OB depends on higher-order features of connectivity and is produced by a network mechanism that differs from canonical computations in the retina and other sensory systems, presumably because the statistical properties of sensory inputs differ between sensory modalities. In visual cortex, functionally related principal neurons make stronger excitatory connections than random subsets of neurons 40 . Such connectivity can arise from Hebbian plasticity mechanisms, enhance representations of sensory features, and amplify specific inputs in memory networks after learning. The connectivity observed in the OB, in contrast, results in disynaptic inhibitory interactions between functionally related principal neurons. Functional connectivity in the OB is therefore similar in structure, but opposite in sign, to excitatory connectivity motifs in visual cortex. As a consequence, the connectivity in the OB suppresses, rather than amplifies, specific features in the input. Such a mechanism appears useful to attenuate the impact of irrelevant sensory inputs and to reduce undesired correlations. The mechanism of feature suppression is consistent with networks that have been optimized for whitening in a theoretical framework with biologically plausible constraints [41] [42] [43] , and inhibitory functional interactions between neurons with related tuning have also been observed in the rodent neocortex 44 . The elementary microcircuit that mediates whitening in the OB may therefore contribute to similar computations also in other brain areas. Methods Animals and preparation Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained and bred under standard conditions at 26.5°C. Embryos and larvae of a double-transgenic line (elavl3:GCaMP5 x vglut:DsRed) 45, 46 in nacre background were raised at 28.5°C in standard E3 medium 47 . Imaging experiments were performed as described previously 48, 49 . In brief, larvae 4 -5 days post fertilization were contained in a small drop of aerated E3 without methylene blue or Nphenylthiourea. Larvae were then paralyzed by addition of 20 μl of fresh mivacurium chloride (Mivacron, GlaxoSmithKline, Munich, Germany) 50 and embedded in 2% lowmelting agarose (type VII; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in a perfusion chamber that was inclined by 30° to improve dorsal optical access to the OBs. Agarose covering the noses was carefully removed. A constant stream of E3 (2 ml/min) was delivered through a tube in front of the nose and removed by continuous suction. Throughout the experiment it was ensured that larvae showed normal heartbeat. Larvae that were not fixed for EM recovered from paralysis after a few hours and continued to develop without obvious defects. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with official animal care guidelines and approved by the Veterinary Department of the Canton of Basel-Stadt (Switzerland). The sex of zebrafish larvae is not yet determined at the age used in this study. Odor stimulation Odor application was performed as described 48 . In brief, odors were delivered to the nose through the E3 medium using a computer-controlled, pneumatically actuated HPLC injection valve (Rheodyne, Rohnert Park, CA, USA). The rise time of stimuli was approximately 500 ms 51 . All experiments were carried out at room temperature (~22°C). The odor set comprised one food odor 51 Multiphoton calcium imaging Multiphoton imaging was performed using a microscope equipped with a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (SpectraPhysics) and a 20× objective (NA 1.0, Zeiss) as described 52 . GCaMP5 was excited at 910 nm and emission was detected through green (535 ± 25 nm) and red (610 ± 37.5 nm) emission filters in separate channels. Images (256 × 256 pixels) were acquired at 128 ms per frame using SCANIMAGE and EPHUS software 53, 54 for a total of 2 min in each trial. Trials were performed sequentially in six focal planes that were separated by approximately 10 μm along the dorso-ventral axis of the OB. The field of view covered the entire cross-section of the OB and parts of the adjacent telencephalon. Ten stimulus trials (nine odors and one E3 control), each including two odor applications, were performed in each focal plane. The order of stimuli was E3, food, GCDCA, TCA, TDCA, GCA, Trp, Lys, Phe, Val. In addition, 2 min of spontaneous activity were recorded in each focal plane. After completion of all trials a stack of images covering the whole olfactory bulb was acquired with a z-step interval of 0.5 μm. Automated drift correction Slow mechanical drift, which may be caused by capillary forces acting on the agarose matrix 55 , was corrected between trials by an automated routine. This routine acquired a small stack (± 3 μm around the focus; 0.5 μm steps) and compared images to a reference acquired previously by cross-correlation after standardizing image columns and rows. The field of view was then automatically translated in X,Y and Z to maximize the crosscorrelation to the reference. Electron microscopy Preparation and imaging of this sample have been described previously 25, 26 . Briefly, tissue was stained en bloc with osmium, uranyl acetate and lead aspartate using an established protocol 56, 57 with minor modifications and embedded in Epon resin with silver particles to minimize charging 25, 26 . Multi-tile images were acquired in high vacuum using a scanning electron microscope (QuantaFEG 200; FEI) equipped with an automated ultramicrotome inside the vacuum chamber (3View; Gatan). Section thickness was 25 nm, pixel size was 9.25 × 9.25 nm 2 , and the electron dose was 17.5 e -nm -2 . The dataset comprised 4,746 successive sections of which one section was lost due to technical problems. The final stack was cropped to a size of 72.2 × 107.8 × 118.6 μm 3 . Neuron reconstruction and synapse annotation Skeletons of all neurons in the OB were reconstructed previously as described 25, 26 . Briefly, three independent skeletons of each neuron were generated manually from seed points at somata. Skeletons were converged and mismatches were corrected as described, and high accuracy was verified by measures of precision and recall 26 . Tracing was performed using KNOSSOS (www.knossostool.org) or PyKNOSSOS (https://github.com/adwanner/ PyKNOSSOS). Most skeletons were generated by a professional high-throughput image annotation service (www.ariadne.ai). Synapses were annotated manually using PyKNOSSOS in "flight" mode 25 . In the default configuration, PyKNOSSOS displays image data in four viewports: the YX viewport (imaging plane) and three mutually orthogonal viewports of arbitrary orientation. In "flight" mode, the latter is perpendicular to the direction of the current neurite. We found that this "auto-orthogonal" view increases tracing speed and facilitates the identification of branch points and synapses. Annotators followed skeletonized reference neurons along precalculated paths to ensure that all neurites were annotated. Most synapses were annotated by a professional image annotation service (www.ariadne.ai). Synapses were identified by a cloud of vesicles that touched the plasma membrane, often at a site of intense staining. Annotators defined synapses by placing three nodes: (1) a node in the presynapse, (2) a node in the synaptic cleft, and (3) a node in the postsynapse. Nodes in the presynapse and postsynapse are skeleton nodes of the pre-and postsynaptic neurons if these skeletons are available. In addition, annotators assigned a confidence level c to each synapse. This confidence level was introduced because synapse identification is not unambiguous; rather, human experts can disagree whether a given structure is a synapse or not even when image quality is high. Synapses were then classified as either "input synapse", "output synapse", "sensory synapse" or "unknown". Input and output synapses are synapses of the reference neuron with the corresponding directions, excluding synapses with sensory neurons. Sensory synapses are input synapses received by the reference neuron from axons of sensory neurons, which were identified by their dark cytoplasm 58 . Unknown structures resemble synapses but do not display all characteristic features. These structures often included an intense staining of the membrane but no clearly associated vesicle cloud. We therefore speculate that some of these structures may be gap junctions. We first annotated input and output synapses of all MCs and INs independently of each other. Hence, each synapse should have been encountered twice, once from the presynaptic side and once from the postsynaptic side. Synapses of INs were then annotated again by different individuals, resulting in a 3-fold redundancy for each MC-IN synapse. In order to minimize the number of false positives the final wiring diagram retained only those MC-IN synapses that were annotated on the MC and at least once on the IN. As a control, we also repeated connectivity analyses and simulations with a wiring diagram that included only those synapses that were annotated at least three times. This wiring diagram produced very similar results (not shown). Each synapse was assigned a unitary weight. As a consequence, the strength of the connection between two neurons in each direction was given by the number of synapses between this pair of neurons. In addition, we tested two other methods to determine synaptic strength. First, connection strength was binarized such that all connections had strengths 0 or 1, independent of the number of synapses. Second, we defined the weight of a synapse as its mean confidence level c, and the total weight of a connection as the sum of the confidence levels of all synapses. In addition, we tested various confidence thresholds to discard synapses with low confidence before determining the weights. Similar results were obtained with all methods and a wide range of confidence thresholds, implying that results are highly robust. Correlation between multiphoton and SBEM image stacks Mapping of multiphoton to SBEM image data may be complicated by (1) mechanical distortions introduced by the sample preparation procedure, (2) shrinkage due to loss of extracellular space induced by chemical fixation 59 , and (3) developmental changes occurring during the approximately three hours between the first calcium imaging trial and the final fixation of the tissue. Initial observations indicated that distortions between image datasets were mostly linear (rotation, translation, shrinkage) while non-linear distortions appeared minimal and developmental changes were negligible. We therefore used an affine transformation to map multiphoton images into the SBEM stack, followed by manual fine adjustment of regions of interest (ROIs) for the extraction of calcium signals. An initial affine transformation matrix was fitted to a set of corresponding points that were selected manually in both datasets. The EM volume was then transformed onto the twophoton images, the position of existing points were optimized manually, and additional pairs of corresponding points were selected. The transform was then re-calculated based on the updated set of landmarks and this procedure was iterated until asymptotic behavior was observed. All somata of the OB were outlined manually in the SBEM dataset and mapped onto the time-averaged multiphoton fluorescence images of each trial, resulting in 7280 mappings of somatic outlines in the SBEM dataset to regions of interest (ROIs) in 66 multiphoton images (11 trials at each of six optical planes). The position of all ROIs was then manually adjusted to optimize the mapping in each trial. The average displacement of ROIs during manual adjustment was small (593 ± 833 nm; mean ± s.d.; Extended Data Fig. 1b ), demonstrating that the accuracy of the initial affine mapping was already high. INs in the larval zebrafish OB were previously divided into three classes based on morphological criteria 26 Analysis of calcium signals Individual frames of multiphoton image time series were low-pass spatially filtered with a mild 2D Gaussian kernel (σ = 1.2 pixels). Baseline fluorescence F was calculated as the average fluorescence during a 2 s window before response onset. Traces representing relative changes in fluorescence (ΔF/F) in each ROI were averaged over the two successive odor applications in each trial and band-pass filtered in time using a Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.2 times the frame rate. The average population response onset (t = 0) was determined manually from all raw ΔF/F traces and fixed for all trials. Firing rate changes of neurons represented by individual ROIs were estimated by temporal deconvolution of calcium signals as described 28 using standard parameters (τ decay = 3 s, thr noise = 0). Analyses of population activity were restricted to neurons represented by ROIs with a radius ≥2 pixels in all trials (corresponding to an area of 3.14 μm 2 ; 232 MCs and 68 INs). For network simulations and mechanistic analyses of whitening we considered only the 208 MCs that were pre-and post-synaptic to at least one IN and excluded 24 presumably premature MCs. Population responses to different odors were compared by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between the population activity vectors of MCs for the different stimuli at a given time point after response onset. Network modeling MCs are glutamatergic while most or all INs in the developing zebrafish OB express GABA 48 . We therefore consider MCs to be excitatory and INs to be inhibitory. MCs and INs were simulated as threshold-linear units with a state variable representing firing rate. The r i (t) and u j (t) representing firing rates of MC i and IN j, respectively, followed the equations of motion The time course of sensory input S i (t) was modelled as difference of exponentials as described previously 33 : To model S i (t), the individual sensory input of MC i, we used its experimentally measured activity a i during t 1 and modulated the time course according to s(t): τ MC i ⋅ dr i (t) dt = -r i (t) + G sen i S i (t) -G inℎ i W MC IN i ⋅ [ u (t) -θ IN ] + τ IN j ⋅ du j (t) dt = -u j (t) + G exc j W IN MC j ⋅ [ r (t) -θ MC ] + s(t) = -a j, ∞ + a j, ∞ 1 -α (1 -e -τ S i (t) = a i s(t) s max , where s max = max t ≥ 0 (s(t)) The differential equations were solved in MATLAB with a fixed step size of 1 millisecond using a first degree Newton-Cotes integration scheme or using an adaptive step size embedded Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (4, 5) scheme. Both integration schemes lead to qualitatively very similar results, and therefore the former method was used for simplicity for the simulated data shown here. In an iterative, semi-automated parameter search, we identified a suitable parameter range that fulfilled the following criteria: (1) The peak firing rates of individual neurons does not exceed a physiologically realistic range (< 200 Hz). ( 2) The strength of inhibition is appropriate to reproduce the time course of the average population activity, correlation and variance. (3) The activity, correlation contribution and variance contribution of individual MCs at t 1 and t 2 is in good correspondence to experimental measurements. Parameters for which these criteria were fulfilled were found by parameter variations in pilot studies. Results were usually robust against variations of each parameter by ±50% around the values reported above. To simulate responses to noisy inputs we assumed that a MC receives convergent input from 40 olfactory sensory neurons of the same type, each spiking with Poisson statistics. Simulated firing rates of sensory neurons were calculated in 25 ms windows, averaged over convergent sensory neurons, and scaled to obtain a total input to each MC with the same mean as in the noiseless case. Assuming that each sensory neuron makes 10 synapses onto MCs, the total number of sensory neurons would be approximately 3'000 per epithelium. Analysis of triplet motifs Occurrences of disynaptic MC-IN-MC and IN-MC-IN motifs were counted after binarizing connections. We enumerated all neuron triplet combinations in the reconstructed wiring diagram and tested for graph isomorphism against all 4 disynaptic motif types. The obtained motif counts were compared against a reference model where the forward and backward connectivity of the MCs were permuted independently while maintaining the node count and edge density (n = 10,000 permutations). The z-scores and p-values were obtained by computing the mean and standard deviation of each motif type in the permuted networks. To compare the motif frequency as a function of the pairwise tuning similarity, we divided the MC pairs into two groups, one with tuning correlation higher than a threshold (e.g., r > 0.5) and one with tuning correlation lower than the threshold (r ≤ 0.5), and counted the occurrences of MC-IN-MC and IN-MC-IN motifs in each group. We then compared the motif counts against a reference model where we permuted the pairwise tuning similarity between MCs and regrouped them by tuning correlation while maintaining the same network topology (n = 10,000 permutations). The z-scores and p-values were then obtained by computing the mean and standard deviation of each motif type in the permuted groups. Additional analyses The contribution of individual MCs to the Pearson correlation coefficient r = 1 n -1 ∑ i = 1 n x i -x sd x y i -y sd y between population activity patterns was calculated by determining the summand x i -x sd x y i -y sd y for each MC. Similarly, the contribution of individual MCs to the variance sd x 2 = 1 n -1 ∑ i = 1 n (x i -x) 2 of the population activity patterns was calculated by determining the summand (x i -x) 2 for each MC. Here, x i and y i are responses of MCs to odors x and y, sd x and sd y are the standard deviations of population responses to odors x and y, and n is the total number of MCs in the population. The analysis of disynaptic connectivity as a function of tuning correlation (Fig. 4c ; Extended Data Fig. 7c ) included only neurons that showed an obvious response because correlation measurements are sensitive to noise. A neuron was classified as responsive when the average of the two largest responses exceeded the mean across all neuron-odor pairs by 0.6 standard deviations. When applied to the matrix representing all MCs and odors, approximately 30% of MCs were classified as responsive by this criterion. Weights of input synapses were normalized for each neuron to the sum of all inputs to that neuron and final plots were normalized to the mean. Statistical analysis No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications 8, 10, 14, 15 or larger. Reconstruction of the wiring diagram required no sampling because all neurons and synapses were annotated. Neurons were randomly assigned to annotators for reconstruction. The study included only one animal. Stimulus presentation was not randomized. Annotators were blind to the identity of neurons. Otherwise, data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. No animals or datapoints were excluded from analyses. Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, a twotailed t-test, a permutation test, or an F-test. Normality and equal variance were tested when statistical tests were used that make these assumptions. Extended Data Extended Data Fig. The average fraction of synaptic inputs onto INs that came from sensory neurons was 5.9 ± 4.6% (mean ± s.d.). This is an upper-bound estimate because structures in EM images were classified as sensory synapses even when they were small and when synaptic features such as postsynaptic densities and vesicle clusters were ambiguous. No obvious synaptic connections were observed from OB neurons onto axon terminals of sensory neurons. b, Displacement of regions of interest (ROIs) during manual proofreading. ROIs representing somata were mapped from the EM dataset to optical image planes in each trial by an affine transformation that was determined by an iterative landmark-based procedure (Methods). Subsequently, the position of each ROI was adjusted manually on the optical image (n = 7,280 ROIs; six image planes with 11 trials each). The mean displacement (± s.d.) during manual adjustment (proofreading) was small (593 ± 833 nm), implying that automated mapping was highly reliable. (1,000 repetitions; n = 414,000; number per bin: 3,000, 19,000, 22,000, 44,000, 96,000, 99,000, 75,000, 29,000, 24,000, 3,000). Black curve shows mean of original data (left). decorrelated by selective inhibition of strongly active neurons, which results in contrast reduction. Decorrelation occurs because the relative contribution of moderately or weakly active neurons is enhanced as the activity of strongly active neurons is suppressed. Selective inhibition of strongly active units is generated by reciprocal inhibition that is stronger or denser within cohorts of co-tuned neurons. Inhibitory feedback gain is therefore higher than the average inhibitory feedback gain within a co-tuned cohort when the stimulus feature that activates the cohort is present (feature suppression). Extended Data Fig. 9 . Further characterization of functional cohorts. a, Composition of functional MC cohorts. For each pair of bile acid odors (X-axis), a functional MC cohort was defined as the 10 MCs that contribute most to the correlation between odor-evoked activity patterns at t 1 (highest r i,t1 ). Gray pixels denote membership of each MC (Y-axis) in each cohort. Cohorts for different odor pairs overlapped substantially. Consistent with this observation, the mean Pearson correlation between tuning curves of MCs at t 1 was significantly higher within cohorts (r = 0.56 ± 0.40; mean ± s.d.) than across all MCs (r = 0.01 ± 0.38; p = 10 -84 ; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Furthermore, we analyzed the mean tuning correlation at t 1 among the 16 MCs that were not part of cohorts themselves but provided the highest number of disynaptic input connections to neurons inside cohorts (r = 0.23 ± 0.52; mean ± s.d.). This tuning correlation was lower than the tuning correlation within the cohort but still significantly higher than the mean tuning correlation across all MCs (p = 10 -40 ; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Similarly, the mean tuning correlation at t 1 among the 16 MCs that received the most disynaptic output connections from neurons inside cohorts (r = 0.17 ± 0.53; mean ± s.d.) was lower than the tuning correlation within the cohort but significantly higher than the mean tuning correlation across all MCs (p = 10      were selected as starter cells. Disynaptic inputs from all MCs were then represented in a vector and averaged over odor pairs. Note strong overrepresentation of disynaptic connectivity within the cohort of starter cells (gray shading). observed in experimental data as in a and in Fig. 5c (same ranking under all conditions). Gray: t 1 ; Colored: t 2 (mean over 50 repetitions for all permutations). To examine the contribution of IN-IN connections to the observed pattern transformations we modified the strength of IN-IN synapses from 100% (same strength as MC←IN connections) to 0% (no IN-IN connections). Reducing IN-IN connection weights slightly decreased the mean activity, consistent with a disinhibitory effect of IN-IN connections, and slightly decreased pattern variance and its s.d.. Pattern decorrelation, however, remained almost unaffected (Fig. , four bile acids (glycochenodeoxycholic acid [GCDCA], taurocholic acid [TCA], taurodeoxycholic acid [TDCA] and glycocholic acid [GCA]; Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and four amino acids (Trp, Lys, Phe, and Val; Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany). Stock solutions of GCDCA, TCA, TDCA, Trp, Lys, Phe and Val at 5 × 10 -3 M in E3 were kept refrigerated and diluted 1:500 (GCDCA, TCA, TDCA) or 1 : 50 (Trp, Lys, Phe, Val) in aerated E3 medium immediately before the experiment. A stock solution of GCA was prepared in 50% ethanol/50% E3 at 2.5×10 -3 M, refrigerated, and diluted 1:250 immediately before the experiment. In a given trial, an odor was applied twice for a duration of ~3 s with an inter-stimulus interval of 60 s. Successive trials with different odors were separated by at least 2 min. . The 68 INs included in the activity dataset included neurons from all three without an obvious bias (13/53 INs of class 1, 20/78 INs of class 2, 31/123 INs of class 3). Moreover, they included 4/4 neurons that were previously classified as atypical projection neurons 26 . We did not observe an obvious bias of IN classes for specific connectivity motifs. where the vectors θ MC and θ IN are firing thresholds, W IN MC j and W MC IN i correspond to the reconstructed IN-to-MC and MC-to-IN connectivity weight matrices of the j th IN and of the i th MC, respectively, and the vectors r (t) and u (t) represent the firing rates of the MC and IN, respectively. [] + denotes half-wave rectification: [x(t)] + = 0, x(t) < 0 x(t), x(t) ≥ 0 τ MC i and τ IN j are the time constants for the individual MCs and INs, respectively. G sen i , G inℎ i and G exc j are the individual scaling factor for sensory, inhibitory and excitatory input, respectively. To account for the natural variability in biological systems, the parameter values for each of the cells in each of the individual simulation runs were drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 1% of the distribution mean. The distribution means of the different parameters were: G sen = 6, G exc = 0.7, G inh = 3.5, θ MC = 2, θ IN = 50, τ MC = 1, τ IN = 80; r t -α + αe -τ d t ) with α = 0.8, τ r = 1 150 , τ d = 1 600 , a j, ∞ = 1 150 1 . 1 Sensory input to INs and mapping of datasets. a, Distribution of the fraction of synaptic inputs onto INs that originated from sensory axons. Extended Data Fig. 2 .Extended Data Fig. 7 . 27 Calcium imaging of odor responses. a, Raw calcium signals (ΔF/F) evoked by eight odors in neurons that were present in all trials and included in simulations (208 MCs and 68 INs; average of two trials). Gray bars indicate odor stimulation. b, Raw calcium signals (ΔF/F) evoked by eight odors and E3 medium in neurons that were present in all trials and included in simulations (176 MCs and 50 INs; average of two trials; sorted by response to E3 medium). c, Correlation matrices of MC activity patterns at t 1 and t 2 after excluding 10 MCs with highest responses to E3 medium (all MCs in b except for the first 10; n = 166 MCs in total). Calcium signals weredeconvolved to estimate firing rate changes as in Fig.2. As observed in the full dataset (Fig.2e), MC activity patterns evoked by similar odors were correlated at t 1 and became decorrelated at t 2 . The main results were therefore not affected by possible responses to E3 medium. Wanner and Friedrich Page 21 Nat Neurosci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 July 20. Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Extended Data Fig. 3. Decoding of odor identity from MC activity patterns. a, Pearson correlation matrices showing similarities of activity patterns across odors and trials at t 1 and t 2 (average over 100 repetitions). In each repetition, two activity patterns (trials) were generated for each odor by randomly assigning the first or second response of each neuron to each trial. Note the high correlations between activity patterns representing the same odor in different trials, particularly at t 2 . b, Success rates of odor identification by template matching. For each odor, the vector representing the odor in one trial (test vector) was correlated to vectors representing all odors in the other trial (templates) and assigned to the odor represented by the template with the highest correlation. Dots show the mean fraction of correct identifications, error bars show s.d., boxes show median, 25 th percentile and 75 th percentile (n = 100 repetitions each). Dashed gray line shows chance level. Top: identification based on patterns averaged over time windows t 1 and t 2 (see text). Bottom: identification based on single frames within t 1 and t 2 . Left: tests and templates included all MCs. Center, right: the 10 or 100 MCs with the highest contribution to the initial pattern correlation (highest r i,t1 ) were omitted for each odor pair. Omitting the 10 MCs with the highest r i,t1 (cohorts) had almost no consequence on odor identification, confirming that information about precise odor identity is conveyed predominantly by other MCs.

Additional simulation results. a, Mean Pearson correlation between IN activity patterns (blue) and the corresponding MC activity patterns (black) evoked by different bile acid inputs in simulations (n = 6 bile acid pairs each). Correlations between IN activity patterns remain higher than correlations between MC activity patterns. b, Mean Pearson correlation between simulated MC activity patterns evoked by inputs representing different odors (blue; all bile acid pairs) and between activity patterns evoked by inputs representing the same odors in trials with input noise (purple; all bile acids). Shading shows s.d.. Noise was modeled based on conservative estimates of the number and firing rates of olfactory sensory neurons in zebrafish larvae (Methods). Three noisy trials were simulated for each odor, resulting in n = 12 correlations between same-odor trials and n = 54 correlations between different-odor trials. Patterns evoked by different inputs were decorrelated whereas noisy versions of the same inputs were not decorrelated. Extended Data Fig. 5. Algebraic transformations of sensory inputs. a, Schematic: simple algebraic approach to approximate transformations of MC activity patterns by feedback inhibition. Input activity patterns (MC activity at t 1 ) were multiplied by the feed-forward connectivity matrix W MC→IN , normalized and thresholded. Normalization and thresholding are basic operations performed by the neuronal circuits of the OB 10 and by individual neurons, respectively. The resulting IN activity patterns were multiplied with the feedback connectivity matrix W MC←IN , resulting in odor-specific patterns of feedback inhibition onto MCs. Feedback inhibition was either subtracted from the MC activation patterns (subtractive inhibition), or MC activation patterns were divided by the feedback inhibition patterns (divisive inhibition), followed by thresholding. Scaling factors and thresholds were adjusted so that effects on the mean activity were small. b, Mean activity, Pearson pattern correlation and s.d. of pattern variance at t 2 after algebraic transformations of input patterns as described in a ("Experiment": experimental results). Horizontal black lines show mean experimental values at t 1 ; activity and s.d. of pattern variance is normalized to the experimental value at t 1 . Dots show means, error bars show s.d., filled bars show difference to corresponding values at t 1 . Box plots show median, 25% percentile, and 75 th percentile. For experimental results and simulations using the reconstructed wiring diagram, variability was measured across odor pairs (correlation; bile acids only; n = 6) or individual odors (s.d. of variance; n = 8). Significance tests compare values at t 2 to experimental values at t 1 (correlation: two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; s.d. of variance: F-test with df1 = df2 = 7 degrees of freedom). For results obtained with randomized wiring diagrams (W random), variability was measured across n = 50 permutations of the wiring diagram. Significance tests compare repetitions to the mean value observed experimentally at t 1 (two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; n.s., not significant. In "targeted suppression", the activity of the 10 MCs that contributed most strongly to the pattern correlation at t 1 for each odor pair ("functional cohort") was set to the population mean. No other manipulations or algebraic operations were performed. P-values: activity: 0.57, 0.57, 0.25, 0.23 0.17; Pearson correlation: 0.03, 0.04, 0.98, 0.04, 0.008; s.d. of variance: 0.003, 10 -23 , 10 -26 , 10 -21 , 10 -16 . Extended Data Fig. 6. Occurrence of connectivity motifs as a function of tuning correlation. Z-scores quantify the over-representation of motifs among MC pairs with signal correlations greater than a threshold between -0.8 and 0.8. For each motif, color-coded bars show zscores for different signal correlation thresholds. Z-scores were determined by comparison against 10,000 shufflings of the tuning correlation matrix as in Fig. 4d. Functional connectivity between interneurons. a, IN-MC-IN triplets included in the analysis. Connections between INs were analyzed separately (see below and main text) to facilitate the comparison to MC-IN-MC triplets (Fig. 4). b, Left: number of IN-MC-IN motifs found in the wiring diagram (considering only INs with activity measurements and at least one MC→IN and MC←IN connection; n = 66). Right: z-score quantifying over-or under-representation of motifs as compared to 10,000 independent randomizations. c, Top: disynaptic connections between responsive INs as a function of tuning similarity (Pearson correlation), normalized to the mean (n = 992 neuron pairs; neurons were included only when their activity exceeded a threshold; see Methods; number of neuron pairs per bin: 192, 218, 178, 228, 176). Dots and error bars show mean ± s.e.m. when tuning curves were determined using all eight odor stimuli. Box plots show median, 25 th percentile and 75 th percentile across results when tuning curves were determined by all possible combinations of four odors. Bottom: result of the same analysis including only reciprocal connections (motif 4; n = 992 neuron pairs). d, Left: Pearson correlations between the mean tuning curves of MC inputs to INs (n = 57 INs). INs were ordered by optimal leaf ordering for hierarchical clustering. Right: Pearson correlations between the mean tuning curves of the MC targets of INs (same ordering of INs). INs were included in the analysis when their activity was measured, when they received input from at least 1 MC and 1 IN for which activity measurements were available, and when they targeted at least 1 MC and 1 IN for which activity measurements were available. e, X-axis: Pearson correlation between the tuning curves of each IN and the mean tuning curves of MC inputs to the same IN (r IN-inputs ). Y-axis: Pearson correlation between the tuning curves of each IN and the mean tuning curves of its MC targets (r IN-targets ). r, correlation coefficient; ***, p = 10 -8 (two-tailed t-test, n = 63 INs). INs were included in the analysis when their activity was measured, when they received input from at least 1 MC for which activity measurements were available, and when they targeted at least 1 MC for which activity measurements were available. f, Black: number of maximal IN cliques in the wiring diagram as a function of clique size. Gray curve shows expectation based on randomized wiring diagrams (10,000 permutations). A maximal clique is a complete set of INs that are all reciprocally connected to each other. Top and bottom plots show distributions for cliques without a MC and cliques with one reciprocally connected MC, respectively. Maximal cliques with more than one MC do not exist because the wiring diagram contained no connections between MCs. g, Left: Mean Pearson correlation of tuning curves between neurons in maximal cliques as a function of clique size (n = 414; number per bin: 3, 19, 22, 44, 96, 99, 75, 29, 24, 3). Dots and error bars show mean ± s.e.m.; box plots show median, 25 th percentile and 75 th percentile. Gray curve shows mean after shuffling of tuning correlation matrix (right). Right: same analysis after shuffling of tuning correlation matrix Extended Data Fig. 8 . 8 Effects of different transformations on pattern correlation. a, Schematic: effect of contrast enhancement on the correlation between displaced Gaussian patterns. The X-axis represents neurons while the Y-axis represents their activity. Blue and orange bars represent overlapping activity patterns evoked by two different stimuli. The similarity of activity patterns is quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficient, r. Note that many neurons respond to both stimuli but neurons showing maximal responses differ between stimuli. Hence, strongly active neurons convey stimulus-specific information. Contrast enhancement therefore decorrelates patterns because it emphasizes strongly active neurons and suppresses weakly active neurons. b, Effect of contrast enhancement on the Pearson correlation between activity pattern that overlap in strongly active neurons. Activity patterns have the same Pearson correlation as in a but their shape is slightly different: maximal responses to the two stimuli occur in the same neuron, and tails of moderately or weakly active neurons extend in opposite directions. Hence, stimulus-specific information is conveyed primarily by moderately or weakly active neurons while strong responses are nonspecific. As a consequence, contrast enhancement fails to decorrelate these patterns. c, Patterns that overlap in strongly active neurons (same as in b; r: Pearson correlation) are -17  ; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). b, Black: frequency of each MC-IN-MC triplet motif in MC cohorts (n = 6 cohorts for each motif). Dots show means, error bars show s.d., box plots show median, 25% percentile, and 75 th percentile. Gray: frequency of MC-IN-MC triplet motifs among randomly selected MC subsets of the same size (n = 10 MCs; n = 600 repetitions for each motif). Frequency of occurrence is normalized to the mean frequency in random subsets for each motif. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 (two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). P-values: 0.002, 10 -5 , 0.0008, 0.0001. We also observed that the 10 INs receiving the largest number of MC inputs from each cohort were 1.7 times more likely to make direct connections than random subsets of INs (p = 0.007; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). c, Blue: mean activity of the 10 MCs in the functional cohort defined by responses to TCA and GCDCA (example odors in Fig.5b). Green: mean activity of the 10 INs that were included in activity measurements and provided the highest synaptic input to the MC cohort. As expected, IN activity increased while MC activity decreased during odor application. Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1.

Bottom: decorrelated output patterns with similar variance. Center: Highly simplified illustration of the OB circuit. MCs receive excitatory input from a single glomerulus and interact via inhibitory INs.

response and regulation of blood coagulation. A significant enrichment of housekeeping, disease related and hub genes were observed in these extreme constitution types. Conclusion: Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme constitutional types allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system level differences in normal individuals which could lead to differential disease predisposition. This is a first attempt towards unraveling the clinical phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern biology. An integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise for future predictive medicine. Background Genome wide expression as well as genetic marker studies reveal that most genetic variation is due to inter-individual differences at genetic loci within populations [1] [2] [3] [4] . The enormous heterogeneity in expression and sequence variation of genes coupled with genetic network interactions and environmental factors contributes to phenotypic diversity in health and disease. In the Ayurveda system of medicine, predisposition to a disease as well as selection of a preventive and curative regime is primarily based on phenotypic assessment of a person which includes one's body constitution termed "Prakriti". Prakriti is a consequence of the relative proportion of three entities (Tri-Doshas), Vata (V), Pitta (P) and Kapha (K), which are not only genetically determined (Shukra Shonita), but also influenced by environment (Mahabhuta Vikara), maternal diet and lifestyle (Matur Ahara Vihara), and age of the transmitting parents (Kala-Garbhashaya) (see Additional File 1) . In an individual, the Tri-Doshas work in conjunction and maintain homeostasis throughout the lifetime starting from fertilization. Distinct properties and functions have been ascribed to each Dosha. For instance, Vata contributes to manifestation of shape, cell division, signaling, movement, excretion of wastes, cognition and also regulates the activities of Kapha and Pitta. Kapha is responsible for anabolism, growth and maintenance of structure, storage and stability. Pitta is primarily responsible for metabolism, thermo-regulation, energy homeostasis, pigmentation, vision, and host surveillance. Much as it would sound surprising, but the sanskrit version of the modern terms described above exists in the ancient texts (see Additional File 1). Thus phenotypic diversity, according to Ayurveda, is a consequence of a continuum of relative proportions of Doshas resulting in seven possible constitutional types namely Vata, Pitta, Kapha, Vata-Pitta, Pitta-Kapha, Vata-Kapha and Vata-Pitta-Kapha. Amongst these, the first three are considered as extremes, exhibiting readily recognizable phenotypes, and are more predisposed to specific diseases [5] [6] [7] . In an earlier study, correlation of specific HLA-DRB1 polymorphisms with Prakriti has been reported [8] . Recently an attempt has also been made to integrate Ayurveda with functional genomics to identify pathways associated with activity of crude and active components of a herb, Ashwagandha, which is used for cancer treatment [9] . In the present study, to investigate the Ayurvedic system of phenotypic classification in molecular terms, we examined the possibility of identifying genome wide expression and biochemical differences amongst the Prakriti types. We considered gene expression for correlation because it is a better measure of functional variation at the molecular level and can also be mapped more effectively to biological processes and pathways [10, 11] . It has also been recently demonstrated that genetic variations underlie variations in gene expression [12] [13] [14] . As a first step we analyzed normal healthy individuals belonging to the three most contrasting groups -Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Methods Development of questionnaire for Prakriti assessment A questionnaire for clinical phenotyping was designed on the basis of Ayurvedic literature on phenotypes and methods of Prakriti assessment (see Additional File 1). The phenotypic classification, broadly, takes into account criteria for defining anatomical features like body built, body frame, size and symmetry of body parts, physiology, physical endurance and aptitudes. Besides, the questionnaire also captures information pertaining to ethnicity, family history of diseases etc. Each of the questions has multiple options to choose from, and each of the options further refers to it being a property attributed to either V, P or K (see questionnaire as Additional File 2 and Table 1 ). Individuals who had thin and narrow body frame, weakly developed body build, with irregular appetite, food and bowel habits, difficulty in gaining weight, quick at physical activities, dry skin and hair, and less tolerance for cold temperature were considered as Vata Prakriti. Individuals with moderately developed build, high frequency of appetite and thirst, good digestive power, perspiration tendency higher than normal, tolerance for cold weather, moderately mobile with moderate physical strength were identified as Pitta Prakriti. Individuals who had broad body frames with well developed body build, tendency to gain weight, low appetite and digestion, preferred to be less mobile, less forgetful and with good healing power and cool temperament, were selected as Kapha individuals. We also developed an automated software for parsing and calculating scores of V, P, K in an individual using a 0/1 against V/P/K for each of the questions depending on a no or yes answer respectively. Cumulative scores of V, P and K is calculated in each individual through the software without the intervention of the Ayurveda expert. Clinical phenotyping and identification of volunteers The identification of individuals of predominant Prakriti types were carried out by two Ayurveda physicians (co authors of this paper). In order to avoid any confounding observations due to population stratification the study was conducted on Indo-European speaking large populations predominantly from North India. A preliminary assessment of Prakriti was carried out on a total of 850 volunteers, nearly half by each of the two clinicians using subjective assessment and a screening questionnaire. The short-listing of individuals to be recruited for detailed phenotyping was also carried out independently. The short-listed individuals were swapped between the two clinicians and were assessed in detail for their Prakriti using the questionnaire (see Additional File 2). These comprised of nearly 120 individuals of predominant Prakriti and 200 individuals of heterogeneous Prakriti. There was nearly 80% concordance observed in Prakriti assessment between two clinicians. Subsequently 96 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals with predominance of either Vata (39 individuals), Pitta (29) or Kapha (28) were identified and included equal numbers of both genders (n = 48 in each case) and belonged to an age group of 18 -40 years (mean age ~23 ± 4 years). Sample collection Peripheral blood samples of selected individuals were collected using standard procedures following ethical guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research, India and informed consent of volunteers. Sample collection was carried out following approval of the Institutional Bioethics Committee (IBC). Three hours prior to sample collection all the volunteers were provided a similar diet with no interim intake of food, beverage or smoking. It was ensured that the subject was not ill or under any medication. Blood pressure, pulse, and menstrual cycle, if on, were also recorded. Biochemical estimation and analysis 33 biochemical parameters which are used in routine diagnostics were selected. Biochemical estimations were carried out using automated analyzer and standardized kits on all selected volunteers. The tests performed and the standard accepted normal ranges for these parameters are provided in the Additional File 3. In order to determine differences between the groups, the parameters with normal distribution were analysed using one way ANOVA with the help of MATLAB. Kruskal Wallis was used for those with non normal distribution. DNA isolation, genotyping and validation of genetic homogeneity Before undertaking research using these collected samples, the samples were coded in order to maintain their anonymity. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using the salting-out procedure [15] . In order to validate genetic homogeneity, these samples were genotyped and analyzed along with 24 reference populations derived from different ethnic and linguistic lineages, Indo-European (IE), Austro-Asiatic (AA), Tibeto-Burman (TB) and Dravidian (DR) from various geographical zones using a panel of SNPs which were identified as a part of an ongoing Indian Genome Variation Consortium project [16, 17] . Genotyping of SNPs was carried out on the Bead array based Illumina platform. Estimation of DA distance [17, 18] between populations and phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the neighbor joining (NJ) method [19] which was done using DISPAN (available from http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/) RNA isolation and cDNA microarray experiments RNA was extracted within 2-3 hrs of collection using the EZ-RNA isolation kit (Biological Industries, Israel) following the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression profiling was carried out using Human 19Kv8 cDNA microarray (UHN Microarray Databases, CA Ontario). We followed a loop design method for inter group comparisons (illustrated below). In each set of experiments (Figure 1 ) comprising of 3 slides, pooled samples of each Prakriti were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 and hybridized to the other two [20] . Four sets of experiments for males and females each were carried out involving a total of 72 samples. One set of experiments failed the QC criteria and was not considered for analysis. The results of 4 biological replicates and 4 technical replicates (dye swap) of each Prakriti in females, and 3 biological and 3 technical replicates of each Prakriti in males are presented. The detailed method for labeling, hybridization and scanning are given below. The data has been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, ID GSE7883) following Minimum Information About Microarray Experiment (MIAME) norms. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from 15 μg of total RNA of pooled samples (5 μg each sample), using Microarray cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, GmbH). The cDNA was purified using Micorarray Target Purification Kit (Roche, GmbH), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each pool of Vata, Pitta and Kapha purified cDNA was divided into two halves, and labeled with Cy5 or Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences) using Microarray RNA Target Synthesis Kit T7 (Roche, GmbH) and the labeled products were purified using Microarray Target Purification Kit (Roche, GmbH). Pooled samples were precipitated, washed and air-dried. The dried pellet was dissolved in RNAase free water (Sigma). Hybridization solution was prepared by mixing hybridization buffer (DIG Easy Hyb; Roche, GmbH), 10 mg/ml salmon testis DNA (0.05 mg/ ml final concentration, Sigma) and 10 mg/ml yeast tRNA (0.05 mg/ml final concentration, Sigma) and added to the labeled product. This mixture was denatured at 65°C and applied on to 19K cDNA microarray. Hybridization was carried out at 37°C for 16 hrs. Following hybridization, slides were washed thrice (15 minutes each) in 1× SSC (Saline Sodium Citrate) and 0.2% SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate) at 50°C. This was followed by two 15 minute washes at room temperature in 1× SSC. Finally, slides were washed in 0.1× SSC for 15 minutes and excess fluid was removed from the slide by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 5 minutes. Microarray slides were scanned at 10 μm resolution in GenePix 4000A Microarray Scanner (Molecular Devices). The 16 bit TIFF images were preprocessed and quantified using Gene Pix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices). Statistical analysis of microarray Analysis was carried out using R language [21] taking two sets of experiments at a time (which include four data V P Loop design of microarray experiment K cy3 cy5 points each of V, P, K), separately for male and female data. Background subtracted mean values were considered for analysis and only spots having above background values across all arrays were considered. Values were log2 transformed and lowess normalization was applied to remove spatial dye bias. Across-array normalization was carried out using quantile normalization method. Oneway analysis of variance was adopted to identify differentially expressed genes in all three categories. F-test was carried out in order to reject the hypothesis of equality of three group means. In order to investigate further the nature of differentially expressed genes; strip charts were drawn and pair wise comparisons were made using t-test. p-values obtained from t-test have been adjusted for multiplicity using Bonferroni method for controlling family wise error rate. Genes at p ≤ 0.05 level of significance were considered to be differentially expressed among all three groups. In order to investigate whether the expression differences observed between V, P, K were specific or contributed by inter-individual variations we randomly generated three groups from the same experiment sets as used in V, P, K analysis. A similar analysis methodology was applied as described above and genes whose expression differences were significantly different at p ≤ 0.05 were considered. This was repeated twice with different random sets. In addition we also studied genes which show intra group variations within each constitution types (by estimating variance) as well as those which did not vary across all the constitution types (by estimating S.D). For both the cases quantile normalized expression values were used, treating each pool as a sample. We selected a 5% cut off of upper variance and lower S.D for identifying the genes that show intra group variations or are similar across groups, respectively. Similarly to investigate whether the biochemical differences obtained among V, P and K are specific to these groups, we randomly labeled the 96 samples into three groups and carried out ANOVA. This process was iterated 1000 times. The mean of the F values obtained from random samples were compared with that obtained with the test set and depicted as Box plot using R language. Quantitative PCR analysis In order to validate the microarray experiment results a small subset of 18 genes along with 18S rRNA (control) were selected for quantitative real time PCR on individual samples of males and females. TAQMAN PCR using custom designed TLDA assay (Applied Biosystems) was carried out on ABI 7900. Each experiment was carried out in triplicates. RNA from all samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA using High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), following the manufacturer recommended protocols. The cDNA was amplified using Taqman universal PCR mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). It was ensured that the amount of cDNA template added to each reaction was restricted to a relatively narrow Ct range as determined by the cDNA quality control measurement of 18S rRNA. Since no single reference/control was used in the study, instead of fold change values, expression differences were estimated through comparison of delta (Δ) Ct values of V, P and K subsets using ANOVA. ΔCt values were calculated for each gene using 18srRNA as internal control. Since the sample sizes were small, both males and females (n = 96) were considered together for the analysis. One way ANOVA was carried out using MATLAB for determining differences between the three and two groups. Low or High mean ΔCt values were inferred as up-regulation or down-regulation respectively. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using GO tools Box http://burgundy.cmmt.ubc.ca/GOToolBox/ for classifying the differentially expressed genes into biological processes. Annotation of 19 K array as obtained by source batch search http://smd-www.stanford.edu/cgibin/source/sourceBatchSearch (June 2007 release) was used for GO analysis. We looked at enriched GO categories both with (p ≤ 0.05), and without Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 0.01) as Bonferroni correction has been proposed to be overly conservative and counterproductive in interpreting microarray results [22] . Pathway analysis was carried out using Pathway Express of ONTO-Tools http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/ [23] . We followed the definition of hubs as those which belonged to the top 20% of the interacting proteins [24] as reported in HPRD database http://www.hprd.org. These hubs had more than ten interacting partners. Human housekeeping genes were retrieved from the Eisenberg and Levanon's study [25] . Cluster and Tree View were used for making Heat Maps. Results Genetic affinity of the study population to Indo-European populations of India Indian populations exhibit extensive linguistic and ethnic diversity. Therefore, as a first step, the genetic homogeneity of the study population was validated by phylogenetic analysis with known ethnic Indian populations included in the Indian Genome Variation Consortium. Analysis confirmed that the study population was most closely related to Indo-European Large populations [16, 17] which corroborated with the information captured in the questionnaire (see Additional File 4). Clinical phenotyping On an average 10% of the individuals were of predominant Prakriti types as assessed by the physicians. Cumulative scores of V, P and K calculated for each individual through the software without the intervention of the Ayurveda expert also corroborated with the expert's assessment. The percentage mean score of either V, P or K features in individuals of predominant Vata, Pitta or Kapha constitution types respectively calculated through the software was significantly higher than the mean score of V.P, K obtained from set of heterogeneous Prakriti groups who were not classified as predominant types. Individuals of different Prakritis exhibit differences at biochemical level Among the 33 Biochemical parameters, 15 parameters in males and 4 in females, revealed significant differences (p ≤ 0.05), albeit, within the normal range, with respect to Prakriti (Figure 2A and 2B and see Additional File 5). Notably, the components of the lipid profiles like triglyc-erides (TG), total cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, LDL/HDL ratio, the common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases was higher in Kapha when compared to Pitta and Vata males. Additionally, Kapha also had lower levels of HDL when compared to Vata. The levels of serum uric acid, recently considered to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, were also found to be elevated in Kapha. In addition, GGPT, SGPT, and serum Zinc were found to be high in Kapha. Serum prolactin and prothrombin time were high in Vata in comparison to Kapha and/or Pitta. On the other hand, hematological parameters like hemoglobin, PCV, and RBC count differed significantly amongst all the three groups where, Pitta males showed high values in comparison to Vata and/or Kapha. In females only 4 parameters among all those measured differed among the groups with Pitta showing the highest levels in all cases. Phosphorus level varied significantly among groups with Pitta > Kapha > Vata. Besides, Pitta dif-Differentiating biochemical and hematological profile between and Prakriti groups Figure 2 Differentiating biochemical and hematological profile between and Prakriti groups.

Significant differences were not obtained when random sets (1000 iterations) of individuals grouped into three sets were compared. The mean of F statistics from ANOVA of the random sets was insignificant and always lower than the test sets (see Additional File 6). Significant differences in genome wide expressions among individuals of distinct Prakriti types Analysis of genome wide expression through cDNA microarrays, using independently pooled samples of Vata, Pitta and Kapha males and females in a set of loop design experiments revealed a number of differentially expressed genes in each category of individuals. Out of the 8416 annotated genes in the 19K array (CA Ontario) 159 in males and 92 in females (excluding un-annotated ESTs) were observed to be differentially expressed (p ≤ 0.05). Only 5 genes among these were common to both the groups. Amongst the differentially expressed genes there was a significant (p < 1.8 × 10-12; n = 53) over-representation of hub and housekeeping genes (p < 10-07; n = 19) (see Additional File 7) . 93% of the differentially expressed genes amongst the Prakriti groups did not show any over-lap with the genes obtained with the random sets. Real time quantitative PCR was carried out on 96 individual samples for validation of microarray data. 18 genes were considered for analysis, eight (ADM, ATP5G2, CH25H, FAS, FTL, HLA-DQB1, KCNJ2, TALDO1) showed similar profiles as observed in microarray (see Additional File 8). Systemic differences in Prakriti types reflected in GO categories and molecular pathways Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes, revealed contrasting enrichments of core biological processes which remained significant even after Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 0.05, Table 2 and 3 ) amongst the Prakriti groups. Males of the Vata group showed a distinct up regulation of genes involved in regulation of cyclin dependent protein kinase activity and regulation of enzyme activity. In Vata females, over-expression of genes related to nucleocytoplasmic transport was observed. In Kapha males, overall down-regulation of genes of fibrinolysis involved in negative regulation of blood coagulation was observed. Pitta males exhibited significant over expression of genes related to immune response (response to biotic stimulus) (Table 2 and 3 ). However, there were some distinct differences between males and females. Besides, females also demonstrated comparatively lower inter group differences and a considerable higher intragroup variance (data not shown). When analysis was done without the overly conservative correction, some similarity in biological processes was revealed in males and females (Figure 3A and 3B). Both males and females of Vata group showed enrichment of differentially expressed genes involved in cellular processes like cell cycle, DNA repair and recombination. Additionally males of the Vata group showed a distinct down regulation of genes involved in response to biotic stimulus and inflammatory response which was not observed in the corrected GO Biological processes. In Kapha males, overall up-regulation of genes involved in cellular biosynthesis including ATP and cofactor biosynthesis and purine salvage pathway were observed. Complement activation was observed to be low in both Kapha males and females. We also compared the biological processes which differentiated the constitution types versus the ones which did not. Strikingly, none of the biological processes obtained after correction show any overlap. However, when we did not perform correction there were a few overlaps in the processes. Importantly, in males, immune response, cell homestasis, co-factor biosynthesis, purine salvage, fibrinolysis, DNA damage check point and protein export from nucleus were exclusive to the differentially expressed set. In females, lipid biosynthesis, neurotransmitter catabolism, NLS-bearing substrate import into nucleus, mitotic recombination was unique to the differentially expressed set. The processes like cell division, differentiation, motility and development as well as processes related to protein localization were observed to be enriched in the dataset of similarly expressed genes (see Additional File 9). The systemic differences observed between the Prakritis in biological processes were also evident in pathways. For instance over-expression of genes of immune related pathways was observed in Pitta and cell cycle related in Vata in males (Table 2 and 3 ). Though immunity was not reflected as enriched in GO process, both B-and T-cell receptor signaling pathways were enriched in overexpressed genes of Kapha males. It is interesting to note that functional categories of genes that significantly vary among Prakriti groups correlate with few descriptions of their functions in Ayurveda for e.g. Vata (cell division and regulation of function of Kapha and Pitta), Pitta (host surveillance) and Kapha with anabolism (see Additional File 1) Discussion We observed significant differences in biochemical and genome wide expression levels in individuals from three contrasting constitution types selected on the basis of phenotyping principles of Ayurveda (Table 2 and 3 ). A number of differences in biochemical parameters also correlate to gene expression differences. Lipid profiles, which are used as markers for cardiovascular diseases differed significantly between groups. Apart from lipid profile, serum uric acid, recently considered to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality [26] was also found to be significantly high in Kapha males, compared to other groups. Besides, Kapha males also had high levels of LDL, reduced prothrombin time and low expression of genes related to fibrinolysis (KRT1 and F2), features which are reported to increase risk for atherosclerotic conditions [27, 28] . Susceptibility of Kapha individuals to cardiovascular and atherosclerosis also exists in Ayurveda texts (Dhamani Pratichaya, see Additional File 1). Females classified by Prakriti did not exhibit differences in lipid profiles, possibly due to age and heterogeneity in hormonal cycles even within similar constitution types. Heterogeneity in females were also reflected in gene expression profiles. Hematological differences also correlated with gene expression levels. Higher expression of genes which affects hemoglobin levels HBA1, HBB, NOV [29] , in Pitta com-pared to Vata and Kapha correlate with the differences in hemoglobin levels between the Prakritis. Interestingly, 78 (31% of the entire data set) of the genes that were differentially expressed among Prakriti groups were reported to be associated with complex and monogenic diseases in OMIM and genetic association database (GAD). Noteworthy were number of hub genes like TLR4, FAS, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA1, F2, HLA-C, IFNAR1, which link complex diseases related to metabolic, immunological, infectious, cardiovascular, neuro-psychiatric disorders and cancer (see Additional File 10). Additionally genes DPYD [30, 31] , ABCC1 [32] , FTL [33] and ICAM3 [34] whose expression is shown to be associated Differentiating genome wide expression profile between Prakriti groups Figure 3 Differentiating genome wide expression profile between Prakriti groups. Data shown is based on Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) category enrichments in distinct Prakriti groups -"Vata" (V), "Pitta" (P) and "Kapha" (K). Each column defines profiles based on their unique expression in one Prakriti compared to the other two. For instance "P-" refers to downregulation in Pitta when compared to Vata and Kapha and vice versa for "P+". Heat map (made using Cluster and Tree View) represented in Figures (A) and (B) depicts significant GOBP enrichments in male and female respectively. with outcome of cancer treatment were also observed in the data set. The differential expression of these disease associated genes might have implication in health and disease. Conclusion It is well acknowledged that subtle variations in large number of genes and their interactions can give rise to system-wide changes confer differential predisposition to diseases. These variations are common and contribute to 95% of the inter-individual differences observed both at the expression and genetic level in a population. In this exploratory study, we have analysed differences between subsets of individuals from a homogeneous population which are at the phenotypic endpoints of normal health spectrum identified using method of classification described in Ayurveda. The extreme constitution types revealed differences at gene expression level as well as biochemical levels and also included genes with reported disease involvement. Interestingly, it revealed differences in a significant number of hub and housekeeping genes which if perturbed can have system-wide effects. Although, this study has been carried out on a small dataset and requires a more rigorous study of Ayurveda based phenotype to genotype correlations on larger number of individuals and diverse populations for validation, nevertheless, it gives us a lead and confidence to use this method of phenotyping to capture variability among the normal healthy individuals and classify them into more uniform population types. The study provides a molecular framework for understanding the holistic principles of the Indian Traditional System of Medicine, Ayurveda. Identification of genetic variations that underlie differential expression of genes and biochemical end-points, co-relatable to Prakriti phenotypes will further provide a strong basis for integration of this holistic science with modern genomic approaches for predictive marker discovery and system biology studies.

Introduction Although the human genome reference sequence provides a common scaffold for the annotation of genes, regulatory elements and other functional units, it does not contain information about how individuals differ in their DNA sequences. 1 3] [4] [5] Fueled by the commercial development of microarrays for efficient SNP genotyping and collaborative projects in large samples, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided a systematic approach to test genetic variants for a role in disease. To date, GWAS have reproducibly identified thousands of genomic loci, providing insight into underlying pathways of disease, in some cases with translational and clinical impact. 6, 7 [12] The characterization of rare variation poses a major challenge. Since rare alleles have emerged, on average, relatively recently, 13 they show much greater geographic clustering 14 and are more susceptible to population stratification compared to common variation. 15 It is therefore imperative to study large samples across multiple populations, even within continental groups, to build a relatively complete catalog of rare variation in the human genome. We initiated the Genome of the Netherlands ("GoNL") Project to characterize DNA sequence variation-common and rare-for SNVs, short insertions and deletions (indels) and larger deletions in 769 individuals of Dutch ancestry selected from five biobanks under the auspices of the Dutch hub of the Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-NL). 16, 17 Specifically, we sampled 231 trios, 11 quartets with monozygotic twins, and 8 quartets with dizygotic twins, from 11 of the 12 provinces of the Netherlands without ascertaining on phenotype or disease. (The twelfth province, Flevoland, was excluded from sampling as it was established by land reclamation in the 20 th century.) By whole-genome sequencing these 250 families at ~13x coverage, our aim was to build a resource of 1,000 haploid genomes as representative for a small (41,543 km 2 ) but densely populated country (> 17 million inhabitants) in northwestern Europe (Supplementary Note). Here, we provide the first detailed analysis of the GoNL data set after data processing and quality control (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note). To maximize sensitivity, we analyzed all samples jointly 18 and discovered 20.4 million biallelic SNVs, 1.2 million biallelic indels (< 20 bp) and 27,500 larger deletions (> 20 bp). Of the SNVs, 6.2 million are common (MAF > 5%), 4.0 million are low-frequency (MAF 0.5-5%), and 10.2 million are rare (MAF < 0.5%). Based on coverage and mapping metrics, we estimate that 94.1% of the genome could be called reliably (the "accessible" genome) within which 99.2% of SNVs of 1% frequency should be detectable (Supplementary Note). Indeed, we discovered 18.9M SNVs and 1.1M indels in the accessible, autosomal genome (Supplementary Table 1 ). Indels and large deletions were based on conservative consensus calls from several complementary methods that use information about mapped reads, read depth, read pair, split reads and de novo assembly (Supplementary Note). We used MVNcall for trio-aware phasing and linkage disequilibrium-based imputation, 19 starting from the genotype likelihoods of SNVs and indels, which yielded a fully phased panel of 998 unique haplotypes after QC. The nonreference genotype concordance for SNVs was 99.4% (compared to genotypes from Complete Genomics sequencing data in 20 overlapping samples) and 99.5% (compared to Illumina Immunochip genotypes collected in all GoNL samples). The average coverage of 13.3x coupled with the family-based design allowed us to construct a high-quality whole-genome data set for further analysis, including characterization of structural variation, detection of de novo events, imputation, and demographic inference. Novel variation in GoNL To determine the number of novel variants, we investigated the overlap between GoNL and existing databases. We rediscovered almost all sites (98.2%) in the European sample (CEU) of HapMap Phase 2, 4 and 71.1% of sites in the European subset of the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 (1KG-EUR), 20 consistent with the expectation that commonly segregating alleles across European populations should also be detected in GoNL (Fig. 1a ). Conversely, only 39.0% of SNVs observed in GoNL at 0.5% frequency or below (but excluding singletons) were observed in 1KG-EUR, highlighting the value of studying individual populations in greater depth. The contribution of 7.6 million novel SNVs in GoNL represents a 14.6% increase of dbSNP (build 137), although the majority (75.6%) of these novel variants are singletons. Considering that 16.5% of 2.0 million singletons in 1KG-EUR were also observed in GoNL, we expect that a substantial number of the novel GoNL singletons will be encountered again as we continue to sequence larger samples within the Netherlands and across Europe. Structural variation could be called confidently across a broad size range, from large deletions to short insertions (Fig. 1b ). The overall shape of the size spectrum shows that larger structural events are less frequent than smaller indels, presumably reflecting their relative deleterious nature. We recognized specific peaks in the size spectrum that correspond to microsatellite instability (MSI) around 4 bp, short interspersed elements (SINEs) at 300 bp, and long interspersed elements (LINEs) at 6 kb. In general, we detected a large number of novel deletions throughout the size spectrum. In comparison to 1KG Phase 1, 54.4% of the indels (< 20 bp) and 93.3% of the larger deletions (> 20 bp) are novel (Supplementary Note). Taking advantage of the medium coverage data and using especially tuned methods (PINDEL, CLEVER), our analysis fills an important gap for the discovery of mid-size deletions (30-500 bp) where essentially all (98.4%) of the observed variants are novel. The novelty rate for deletions larger than 500 bp is still substantial (66.3%). We note that most of the deletions reported here are biased to be common because stringent filtering required variants to be present in at least three families and transmitted to at least one offspring. This strategy allowed us to generate a specific call set with an overall validation rate of 96.5% (Supplementary Table 2 ). A more sensitive and complete data set including duplications, inversions, mobile element insertions, and translocations is currently being assembled and validated. Functional variation Predicting the biological consequences of functional variants within a single genome is still an unresolved challenge with important implications for using nextgeneration sequencing in a clinical setting. To characterize the burden of loss-of-function (LoF) variants in detail, we classified all such variants in GoNL according to LoF definitions described by MacArthur et al. 21 and applied various filters to remove potential annotation errors (Supplementary Note). Amongst rare variants, we observed an excess of probably or possibly damaging missense variants (according to PolyPhen-2 22 ), nonsense variants, and frameshift indels, consistent with a model in which such functional variants are subject to purifying selection (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). 23, 24 Of the larger deletions, we counted 66 LoF deletions that eliminate the first exon of a gene or more than half of its coding sequence, 21 and found evidence they were depleted relative to all deletions (p = 0.005 for 20-100 bp; p = 2.6 x 10 -9 for > 100 bp). This effect was amplified when considering only genes listed in the OMIM compendium (p = 2.4 x 10 -27 ), illustrating a strong selective force against large structural changes in key genes. The overall patterns and per-individual distributions of LoF SNVs (premature stops or variants interrupting a splice site) and missense variants are consistent with those found in 1KG (Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 3 ). On average, an individual carries 60 LoF SNVs, 69 LoF frameshift indels, and 15 LoF large deletions. The bulk of these LoF mutations per individual are common (>5% frequency in the population), suggesting that these variants are not subject to strong selective pressure and, though they are proteintruncating mutations, are likely phenotypically benign. This emphasizes the need for caution in assigning pathogenicity to variants purely on the basis of their predicted impact on protein structure. In contrast, when we considered only rare LoF variants, those more likely to be pathogenic, we found that the average individual in GoNL carries 4 nonsense variants, 2 variants interrupting a splice site, and 2 frameshift indels. By comparing these numbers to synonymous variants (which provides a baseline expectation under neutrality), we estimate that each individual carries an excess of 4-5 rare LoF SNVs (Supplementary Note), which are sufficiently deleterious that they will never reach high frequency in the population at large. We also investigated the number of compound heterozygotes of rare LoF SNVs, short indels and large deletions. Across all genes in the genome, we observed three compound heterozygous events mapping to three genes in three separate individuals (average 0.01 compound heterozygous events per individual). The phenotypic impact of compound heterozygotes of rare LoF mutations demands further characterization and should be considered explicitly in rare variant studies. Whereas compound heterozygotes of rare LoF variants are sparse, we expected compound heterozygotes of common LoF variants to be more prevalent assuming these variants are less likely to be deleterious. Indeed, we found that the average number of common-LoF compound heterozygotes per individual increased to 2.89 (range: 0-7). Interestingly, while overall there are 1,917 common-LoF compound heterozygous events across all GoNL samples, these are confined to only 11 genes (Supplementary Table 3a ). All but one of these genes appear to have extreme Residual Variation Intolerance Scores (all >84 th percentile across 16,956 genes), which is unlikely to occur by chance (p = 1.41 x 10 -5 , Supplementary Fig. 4a ). 25 This suggests that these genes are more tolerant of disruptive mutations. Because disease mutation databases are often employed to identify potential variants of interest, we annotated variants in GoNL listed as disease-causing ("DM") in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). 26 We observed that an individual in GoNL carries on average 20 such "DM" variants (range: 9-33) (Table 1 ). Since all GoNL samples were derived from population-based cohorts, the impact of these alleles is unclear. One possibility is that the presence of modifier alleles gives rise to incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity of "DM" variants depending on the particular background of the carrier. 27 An alternative explanation is that, in fact, HGMD contains a considerable number of false-positive disease-causing mutations that need further scrutiny. 28 Of the 1,093 "DM" mutations occurring in GoNL, 32% have a frequency >1%, which is much higher than the prevalence of many of the rare diseases described in HGMD. Following the inheritance patterns of the diseases conferred by these variants, many individuals in GoNL should have been affected by diseases with profound physical or even lethal manifestations (Table 2, Supplementary Table 4 ). In fact, one of these variants (chr14:94847262, an alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency variant) was recently implicated as a pathogenic incidental finding in a set of 1,000 exomes after undergoing stringent filtering including in-depth literature reviews of the original findings. 29 The prevalence of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (OMIM: 613490), an autosomal recessive disease, is estimated to be 0.02-0.06%, yet two unrelated GoNL individuals are homozygous carriers of this variant (prevalence = 0.4%, ~10x higher than the disease prevalence). Further, the typical age of onset of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is between 20 and 50 years old, whereas the two homozygous carriers in GoNL were ages 60 and 63 at ascertainment. These results highlight the potential pitfalls of employing such databases in disease studies and the difficulty of interpreting personal genomes. De novo mutations A distinct advantage of the family-based study design was the ability to call de novo events in genomic regions with sufficient coverage in a trio. To this end, we developed the PhaseByTransmission (PBT) module in the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). 30 From an initial 4.5 million Mendelian violations in the original Unified Genotyper calls made in the 258 independent offspring, we prioritized 58,569 putative de novo mutation (DNM) candidates with PBT (Supplementary Note). After removing polymorphic sites, we counted a total of 29,162 autosomal DNM candidates, still many more than the expected average of 16,306, assuming 63.2 mutations per offspring. 31 To reduce false positives, we evaluated to what extent sequencing features could help increase the DNM prediction accuracy. We selected 1,060 candidate sites across a broad confidence range and validated 569 sites of these as true DNMs using various technologies. We also classified another 1,139 candidates as false positives on the basis of Complete Genomics genotype data in 19 parents and 1 unrelated child. We trained a random forest classifier using 70% of the combined validation results on various features (Supplementary Note), and obtained a model with an estimated classification accuracy of 92.2% based on the remaining 30% of the data (Fig. 2a ). This illustrates that the joint assessment of raw trio data and sequencing context can greatly boost prediction accuracy. After applying this classifier to our initial candidates, we obtained 11,258 high-confidence DNMs (with a range of 18-74 DNMs per individual) that we used for downstream analyses. Due to coverage fluctuating regionally, we expect a substantial fraction of genuine DNMs to be missed. We note that early embryonic somatic mutations would be indistinguishable from germline mutations. We observed a significant positive correlation (r 2 = 0.47, p < 2.2 x 10 -16 ) between the father's age at conception and the number of DNMs in the offspring (Fig. 2b ), providing a third, independent estimate based on a larger sample size. 31, 32 Accounting for a Poisson distributed background mutation rate and correcting for coverage, we estimate that each additional year of father's age is associated with a 2.5% increase of the mean number of DNMs. While parents' ages are highly correlated (r 2 = 0.66), comparing regression models based on the father's and mother's age at conception suggests that the observed age-related increase in DNMs is a predominantly paternal effect (Supplementary Note). Interpolating from the paternal model, we expect on average 75.4% of the DNMs in the GoNL offspring to derive from the father (assuming a linear increase in DNMs from puberty). Using read-pair information we were able to assign parental origin to 1,321 DNMs, and found that indeed 74.5% were paternal in origin. When considering only mutations for which parental origin could be determined, the correlation with father's age remained significant (r 2 = 0.56, p = 0.012) but not with mother's age (p = 0.94) (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The striking consistency of these results highlights the relative impact of paternal and maternal mutations. Within a single family, we also tested if we could discover de novo indels and large deletions. Using strict filtering criteria for Mendelian violations followed by PCR-based Sanger sequencing, we confirmed 6 intergenic indels (4 insertions of 1 bp, 1 deletion of 1 bp and 1 deletion of 2 bp), as well as a large 113 kb deletion located in an intron of the SUMF1 gene at chr3p26 (which seems unlikely to have a significant impact on gene function). These results illustrate that our predictions of indels and structural changes are a valuable source not only for commonly segregating alleles, but also for de novo events. Further work is needed to assess the frequency of such de novo deletions or other types of genomic rearrangements in the general population. Imputation One of the goals of the GoNL Project was to provide a community resource for downstream imputation into GWAS samples. To evaluate the performance of the GoNL panel we used Complete Genomics sequence data collected in 81 individuals of Dutch ancestry, independent from the GoNL samples, which we will refer to as the NTL data set. In these NTL samples, we masked all genotypes at SNVs not present on the Illumina Human-1M array, imputed these "non-genotyped" SNVs from the 1M-genotyped SNVs, and then compared the imputed to the known sequenced genotypes (Supplementary Note). The aggregate mean r 2 was 0.99 for common SNVs, 0.86 for low-frequency SNVs and 0.63 for rare SNVs, indicating that the overall quality was good (Fig. 3 ). We repeated this evaluation based on the SNV content of other microarrays and obtained similar imputation performance for common SNVs, although there were significant differences for lower frequency alleles (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). To directly measure the impact of triobased phasing we constructed a panel based on the unrelated parents alone, and reevaluated the imputation quality in the NTL samples. The imputation accuracy dropped to a mean r 2 of 0.47 for rare variants (0.85 for low-frequency SNVs and 0.98 for common SNVs), indicating that the trio-based phasing contributed significantly to the imputation quality, especially for rare variants. In comparison to 1KG as a reference panel, we observed better imputation accuracy with the GoNL panel for SNVs up to 10% frequency despite the larger sample size of 1KG (Fig. 3 ). To investigate the basis for the improved imputation accuracy with the GoNL panel, we constructed three reference panels based on 1KG-CEU (Northern Europeans from Utah), 1KG-TSI (Tuscans from Italy), and GoNL, all with a fixed sample size of 85 individuals. With each of these reference panels, we imputed in independent CEU, TSI and NTL samples with Complete Genomics data, and then evaluated their performance (Supplementary Note). Of the three panels, GoNL gave the highest imputation accuracy (especially for rare variants) not only for the Dutch NTL samples but also for the CEU samples, ruling out that the improved performance of the GoNL panel was simply due to shared Dutch ancestry of GoNL and NTL samples (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Differentiation between northern and southern European populations may explain why the 1KG-CEU and GoNL panels gave roughly equivalent performance for TSI (but certainly worse than 1KG-TSI). Overall, these results suggest that the GoNL trios have enabled accurate reconstruction of long-range haplotypes with an advantageous effect on the imputation of rare alleles. To assess the potential value of much larger reference panels, we combined the 1KG and GoNL panels with IMPUTE2, 33 and evaluated again the imputation accuracy in the NTL samples. Here we obtained an additional gain in imputation accuracy over the GoNL panel alone, reaching a mean r 2 of 0.70 for rare SNVs and 0.88 for low-frequency SNVs (Fig. 3 ). Thus, increasing the sample size of the reference panel will likely continue to improve imputation performance (especially for lower frequency alleles), which motivates a community-wide effort to create a unified reference panel across multiple ethnicities and populations. Population structure and demographic inference Although it is well understood that extensive migration and gene flow occurred amongst European populations, [34] [35] [36] we focused on creating a unified picture of Dutch demography in recent millennia. Because of unbiased ascertainment and inclusion of rare variation, whole-genome sequence data can potentially offer greater resolution for demographic inference than SNP array data. First, we explored global relationships, analyzing both common and rare variants to elucidate ancient and recent population differentiation. We calculated Hudson's F ST between the Dutch and the 14 populations represented in 1KG Phase I and found that F ST patterns were consistent with continental clustering in principal component analysis (PCA) and with previous estimates (Supplementary Table 5 , Supplementary Fig. 7 ). 37 Among the European populations, the Dutch samples clustered best with 1KG samples from Great Britain and Northern Europe (F ST = 0.0008 and 0.0006, respectively) and least with the Finnish (F ST = 0.0068). To investigate more recent population connections, we focused on so-called f 2 variants that appear exactly twice (in two heterozygote carriers) in the joint data of GoNL and 1KG (Supplementary Note). As was observed in 1KG, within-population f 2 sharing accounts for the majority (50.8%) of all f 2 alleles (Supplementary Fig. 8 ), but f 2 sharing revealed cross-population connections as well. For example, a Dutch sample sharing an f 2 variant with a non-Dutch individual was far more likely to share that variant with another individual of European descent (71.6%) or from the Americas (21.0%, due to substantial European admixture) than with an individual coming from Africa (6.2%) or East Asia (1.3%). These results underscore the high degree of geographic clustering of recent mutations within neighboring populations. Analysis of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (using 492 GoNL parent individuals) (Supplementary Information) revealed that the major haplogroups are H (39.4%), U (25.2%), J (10.4%) and T (10.8%), and the minor haplogroups are HV0 (4.9%), N1 (3.5%), W (3.3%), X (2.4%) and HV1 (0.2%), a composition that is in good agreement with previous observations in other European populations. 38 thin the Netherlands (Fig. 4a ), PCA revealed subtle substructure along a North-South gradient on the first two principal components (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Note), consistent with previous findings. 39, 40 Because PCA has limitations in terms of demographic inference (in particular for migration patterns), 41 we also performed an independent analysis of identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing that revealed subtle signals of migration (Supplementary Note). 42 From the length distributions of the IBD segments, 43 we inferred demographic models and estimated effective population sizes of the Dutch provinces at different time scales, reflecting demographic changes throughout history (Supplementary Note). Analysis of IBD segments of 1-2 cM (Supplementary Fig. 9a ), corresponding to an estimated time-to-most-recent-common-ancestor ≈ 4,000 years, revealed rather homogeneous effective population sizes across the 11 provinces, consistent with common genetic origins. Additionally, we observed a smooth south-to-north gradient of decreasing ancestral population size, accompanied by increased homozygosity in the northern provinces (correlation between average IBD sharing within provinces and latitude: r = 0.952, p = 6 10 ; Supplementary Fig. 10 , Supplementary Note). Traditionally, this observation has been explained by a serial founder effect characterized by migration from the south to the north. 39 terestingly, GoNL samples, regardless of place of birth, tend to share more IBD segments with other individuals from the north of the country than with individuals from the same geographic region. In fact, although within-province IBD sharing is strong (diagonal values of the heat map), the excess sharing with the northern provinces (off-diagonal values for FR, GR, DR, OV, and NH) is evident (correlation between average provinceprovince IBD sharing and average province latitude: r = 0.943, p = 5 10 ; Fig. 4c , Supplementary Table 6a ). This pattern indicates that a simple south-to-north serial founder model is not sufficient to explain the observed IBD sharing. Grouping the provinces into three clusters (North, Center and South), we reconstructed possible coalescent time distributions within and across the clusters. Based on the reconstructed coalescent rates, the average individual from the Center or the South of the country is expected to co-inherit more IBD segments with the average northern individual in the past 4,000 years than with other individuals from the same geographic region (Supplementary Fig. S11 ). While different founder effect patterns emerge from these simulations, they all show support for a substantial amount of regional migration within the Netherlands. Assuming ancient serial migrations towards the North are causing the observed gradient of increasing homozygosity, a possible explanation for these results is that additional migratory events out of the North took place after initial settlements. These subsequent migratory events are consistent with the dynamic nature of the Netherlands, particularly in the northern coastal regions, between 5000 B.C.E. and 50 C.E. (Supplementary Fig. 12 ). More than half of the current Dutch territory is below sea level and a series of abandonments and resettlements of different regions were likely prompted by ocean level shifts and flooding that changed once-habitable land into dunes and marshes or buried regions under water entirely. We emphasize that other more complex demographic models may yield similar patterns of IBD sharing; additional analyses are required to assess alternative scenarios. In recent centuries, the advent of water defense technologies (beginning in the 13 th century) increased land stability, which resulted in other forces influencing demography. An analysis of f 2 variants revealed non-random sharing within and across provinces. Though the proportion of within-province f 2 sharing comprises only 12% of all f 2 alleles, consistent with a homogeneous population, the proportion of within-province f 2 alleles is significantly larger than expected under the null hypothesis of uniform allele sharing across all provinces (Fig. 4d ). This geographic localization of rare variants is suggestive of limited migration in recent centuries, which is consistent with about half of Dutch citizens still living in the same province in which their great-grandparents were born. Notably, Noord-Brabant and Overijssel show significantly stronger within-province f 2 sharing in comparison to the other provinces (p = 1.2 x 10 -151 , p < 10 -200 , respectively), which is in agreement with small effective population sizes in these two provinces inferred from long (7-15 cM) IBD segment sharing (Fig 4c, Supplementary Table 6b , Supplementary Fig. 9b ). Further, we found that within-region sharing in the northern and southern regions was substantially stronger when compared to the central regions (p < 10 - 200 , both comparisons). Altogether, these results suggest increased migration in the central region (as compared to the northern and southern regions), consistent with recent urbanization in the wealthier central provinces. Discussion The results presented here reflect the enormous wealth of knowledge that can be gleaned from whole-genome sequencing data, and illustrate how intermediate-coverage sequencing within a single country complements the cosmopolitan, low-coverage effort by 1KG. The observed proportion of novel variation (in particular for structural variation) underlines the added value of in-depth population studies such as GoNL. Combining sequencing data sets within and across populations will not only maximize sensitivity and resolution for discovery of all types of DNA variation, but also enable population genetic analyses that can shed more light on the shared ancestry of the human species. In spite of the intermediate coverage, we were able to reliably call de novo point mutations and confirm the relationship between paternal age and mutation load. Although we could also identify larger de novo events, these calls will have to be validated empirically and their properties studied across the entire cohort. The methods we developed for DNM discovery should be broadly applicable for disease studies where DNMs are suspected to play a role. 12 DNM represents an important class of DNA sequence variation that can further elucidate fundamental processes of mutagenesis, even if its absolute contribution may be limited in terms of explaining heritability (depending on the disease). 44 In cancer, for example, accounting for the genome-wide heterogeneity of mutation rates may be necessary to accurately pinpoint driver mutations against a background of random mutation. 45 Our results suggest that trio-based sequencing of large samples at intermediate coverage may be a cost-effective way to ascertain genome-wide variation in mutation rates and establish a "null expectation" for the general population against which mutations in cases can be compared. As long as the cost of genotyping continues to be competitive with whole-genome sequencing, imputation on the basis of linkage disequilibrium will remain important. The consolidation of available whole-genome data sets into a single cosmopolitan panel including low-frequency, structural and other complex types of variation 46, 47 should therefore be considered a top priority. Through more complete interrogation of genetic variation, studies of large, well-phenotyped samples will continue to increase opportunities for development of diagnostic tools, prevention measures and therapeutics for human disease.

INTRODUCTION The spatial organization of synapses throughout the dendritic tree is a critical determinant of their integration properties and dictates the somatic firing patterns of individual neuronal subtypes (1) (2) (3) (4) . Within dendritic branches, clustered potentiation of excitatory and inhibitory (E and I) synaptic inputs underlie both circuit development and experience-dependent plasticity (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Recently there has been substantial progress toward mapping neuronal connectivity at multiple scales (10) (11) (12) (13) . However, significant roadblocks remain in identifying basic principles of synaptic organization for individual neuronal subtypes (14) (15) (16) (17) , leaving important questions unanswered: Are there multiple spatial scales of E and I organization within neurons? Are there hotspots of enhanced synaptic connectivity? Is there a structural correlate of E/I balance within specific dendritic domains or individual dendritic segments? Finally, how does E and I synaptic organization characterizing a given neuronal subtype influence the dendritic and somatic firing properties of these neurons? Comparing the distributions of excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the same neuron is particularly important to determine the cellular logic of synaptic organization. At the circuit level, a precise balance of excitation and inhibition is critical for calibrating both global and fine-scale levels of activity throughout development and during adult function (18) (19) (20) . In both auditory and somatosensory cortex, the co-tuning of E and I conductances is set by experience-dependent refinement of intracortical inhibition (21, 22) . An anatomical basis for E/I balance within individual neurons has also been observed in visual cortex and CA1, where excitatory inputs onto pyramidal neurons are continuously offset by somatic inhibition (23, 24) . A conserved ratio of the numbers of E/I synapses was observed throughout the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that the spatial distribution of synapses might also contribute to E/I balance (2) . However, this finding has not been extended to neurons in vivo. Activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors leads to input-specific long term potentiation of dendritic inhibition mediated by somatostatin-expressing interneurons, linking excitation and inhibition within individual dendritic segments (25) . Here we have developed an adaptable, open-source platform for imaging and mapping E and I synapses across the entire dendritic arbor of individual neurons. We created whole-cell reconstructions of individual, optically-isolated pyramidal neurons (PNs) containing information about the size, shape, and continuous position of all E and I synapses across their entire dendritic arbors: the first dataset of its kind for any neuronal subtype. We focused our study on layer 2/3 (L2/3) PNs of the adult mouse primary somatosensory cortex, where substantial prior knowledge of the synaptic microstructure and connectivity allowed validation of our platform and some of our findings (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) as well as identification of new principles of E and I synaptic organization. RESULTS Synapse Detector: a Platform to Create Whole-Neuron Structural Inputs Maps To obtain optically isolated, single L2/3 PNs for these synaptic reconstructions, we co-electroporated Cre-dependent Flex-tdTomato with low levels of Cre recombinase for extremely sparse in utero electroporation ( (32, 33) ; Fig. 1A and Movie S1). We also labeled inhibitory synapses received by individual PNs by co-electroporating the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffolding protein Gephyrin tagged with EGFP, a strategy previously shown to reliably label all GABAergic and glycinergic inputs without affecting their development (9, 34) . We achieved single-synapse resolution using confocal microscopy by imaging neurons across 2-3 serial 150 μm vibratome sections with a 100x 1.49 NA objective lens (Fig. 1B and 1D and Movie S2). This new Synapse Detector toolkit within Vaa3D generates synaptic maps by taking image data and a trace of the dendritic tree as input to automatically isolate E and I synapses within a user-defined radius of each dendrite. Within this toolkit, excitatory synapses (dendritic spines) are classified with a Spine Detector module that identifies regions of fluorescence surrounding the dendritic trace (Fig. 1D top and middle panels and Movies S3-S5). Inhibitory synapses are identified using an IS Detector program that identifies EGFP-Gephyrin puncta that co-localize with the cytosolic Flex-tdTomato (Fig. 1D bottom panel and Movies S6 and S7). Together these software platforms measure E and I synapse position in 3D along the dendritic tree, as well as morphological features of E and I synapses such as their volume, spine neck length, position of I synapses along dendritic shaft or on spine heads (so called dually innervated spines, (9, 27, 35) ). During reconstruction, Synapse Detector's editing features allow the user to edit the volume of each identified synapse and eliminate false positives (Fig. S1 ). Synapse Detector has a minimal false negative rate compared to manual reconstructions and generates consistent annotation results among multiple users (Fig. S3 ). Following reconstruction and manual annotation, synaptic features are associated with nodes providing their geometric position in 3D along the dendritic tree. In the final step, neuron trace fragments containing information about individual synapse position and size from serial tissue sections are stitched together into a final input map with the Vaa3D Neuron Stitcher program that can be used to analyze the morphology of all synapses as a function of their continuous distance from the soma along the dendritic arborization (36) . We used this new Vaa3D reconstruction pipeline to map all E and I synapses across 10 PNs from L2/3 primary somatosensory cortex (as well as excitatory synapses from 2 additional PNs; Fig. 2 ). These neurons contained on average 6773±212 dendritic spines (range: 5558-8115) and 939±101 inhibitory synapses (range: 595-1556; Fig. 2C ). On average, the total length of these dendritic trees was 4579±103 µm and these neurons displayed overall E and I synaptic densities consistent with previous reports (1.48±0.04 spines/µm and 0.20±0.02 inhibitory synapses/µm respectively) ( (9, 35, 37) ; Fig. 2C ). We also found that 26%±2% of inhibitory synapses targeted dendritic spines in L2/3 PNs (Fig. 2C ). This fraction of spines dually innervated by an E and I synapse is comparable with previously observed values in these neurons (9, 27, 35) . Features of E and I synaptic organization across the entire dendritic tree of layer 2/3 PNs To analyze synaptic distribution across the entire dendrites of the reconstructed L2/3 PNs, we subdivided dendritic arbors into three distinct domains: apical tuft, apical oblique, and basal dendrites (38) . Within these domains, we distinguished among segment types by their relative branch order: primary, intermediate, and terminal ((38); Fig. 3A ). This categorization is functionally relevant as different branch orders have distinct passive conductance properties resulting from their relative size and distance to the soma (38, 39) . Primary dendrites have relatively low input impedance due to their large size, while terminal dendrites have higher input impedance due to their smaller diameter and sealed end. In addition to the domain classification used here, we developed a Subtree Labeling program as part of the Spine Detector toolkit that enables user-directed annotation of regions of interest throughout the neuron trace to assess experiment-specific questions about domain-level synaptic organization (Fig. S2E and see Material and Methods). This division of the dendritic tree into specific domains and branch types allowed us to characterize the profile of synaptic distribution across L2/3 PNs. Similar to previous observations in CA1 PNs, E and I synaptic distribution appear to be inversely correlated at the domain level with relatively low spine density proximal to the soma, suggesting that this may be a general feature of synaptic organization across PN subtypes ((40, 41) ; Fig. 3B ). In contrast to previous studies however, our complete reconstructions enable whole-cell mapping of relative E and I synaptic distribution (Fig. 2C , S4 and S5). Maps of E and I synaptic distribution in the same neuron demonstrate an almost complete absence of spines along primary dendrites accompanied by the highest density of inhibitory synapses (Fig. 3C ). L2/3 PNs receive direct thalamic input from both the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) and the posterior medial nucleus (POm) terminating mainly onto their apical tufts (L1) and basal dendrites (L3) respectively (28, 42) . The vast majority of neocortical spines that are dually innervated by an inhibitory synapse receive excitatory inputs from corticothalamic axons, suggesting that distal tuft and basal dendrites should have a relatively high proportion of dually innervated spines (27) . Our unbiased mapping of the location of IS located on spine heads demonstrates that apical tuft and basal terminal dendrites of L2/3 PNs display a significantly higher proportion of dually innervated spines than primary and intermediate dendrites (Fig. 3D-E ), validating the spatial resolution of our labeling, imaging, and reconstruction approaches. Because spine head volume is linearly proportional to excitatory synaptic strength (e.g. size of the post-synaptic density and density of glutamatergic AMPA receptors), it is also possible to use Synapse Detector to map the distribution of relative synaptic strengths (3, 43, 44) . We classified "large" synapses as greater than the highest 20 th percentile of synaptic volume for each neuron, closely corresponding to the persistent 160% increase in volume reported for synapses following structural forms of long-term potentiation (5, 45, 46) . Interestingly, while there is no specific trend for the distribution of large spines across dendritic domains, large inhibitory synapses appear to be clustered around the apical intermediate dendritic segments (Figures 3F and 3G ), a feature never detected before. E and I synaptic distribution is structured and locally balanced in dendritic segments Active dendritic conductances evoked by clustered synaptic inputs can produce nonlinear depolarization and change the probability of somatic firing (47) . Local increases in excitatory synaptic density in a subset of segments within the same dendritic domain could reflect clustered spine stabilization following branch-specific synaptic potentiation (5, 47) . Therefore, we tested if L2/3 PNs exhibit local changes in the relative distribution of E and I synapses across segments within each dendritic domain (Fig. 4 ). To assess the extent of this potential weighted synaptic distribution, we compared the experimentally observed variation in synaptic density between segments within each dendritic domain to randomly shuffled densities for each neuron reconstructed. This was done by randomly redistributing synaptic density values across segments of the same domain (see Supplementary Material). Neurons in which synaptic distribution is significantly weighted toward a subset of dendritic segments would therefore display greater domain-specific variation in synaptic density than correspondingly randomized versions. Excitatory synaptic (spine) distribution is significantly weighted toward a subpopulation of dendritic segments across almost the entire dendritic tree (Fig. 4A and 4D ). Interestingly, inhibitory synaptic distribution is significantly non-random and clustered only in apical and basal terminal domains, raising the intriguing possibility that E and I synapses are weighted toward the same dendritic segments (Fig. 4B and 4D ). Co-regulation of E and I synaptic inputs, generally referred to as E/I balance, is a critical mechanism for calibrating both global and fine-scale levels of neuronal activity (23, 48, 49) . While several studies have demonstrated mechanistic links between E and I synaptic potentiation, whether it results in local, fine-scale balance between E and I synaptic distribution within dendritic segments remains an open question (25, 46, 50) . Remarkably, we find that E and I synaptic density strongly co-varied in terminal segments throughout the dendritic tree of layer 2/3 PNs (Figure 5 ). This structural E/I balance appears to increase as a function of distance from the soma, with segments distal to the soma showing remarkable correlation between E and I synaptic density (Figure 5 ). Taken together, these results demonstrate that in L2/3 PNs: (1) both E and I synaptic density varies more than by chance between dendritic segments among a given dendritic domain and (2) that despite this variability in E and I synapse density between segments of a given dendritic domain, the ratio between E and I synaptic density is tightly controlled locally within these segments. Functional implications of global and domain-specific E/I balance To better understand the functional implications of the local E/I balance we found experimentally (Figure 5 ), we performed computational modeling of the 10 individual L2/3 PNs reconstructed (shown in Fig. S4 and S5 ), including their 3D reconstructed morphology and the dendritic location of their E and I synapses. Passive and active membrane properties of these cells were based on previously published biological values (see Material and Methods). All excitatory synapses were activated randomly at an average rate of 1.75 HZ while inhibitory synapses were activated at 10 Hz so that the firing rate of the modeled cells matched ranges found in vivo (31) . These models also replicated several active and passive dendritic properties observed in L2/3 PNs, including back-propagating action potentials, the somatic input resistance, and membrane time constants (Figure 6 and see Material and Methods). To test the significance of the synaptic distribution we observed in these 10 L2/3 PNs, we manipulated the variance (here measured as standard deviation, SD) of the domain-specific E/I ratio while keeping the total number of synapses within each domain constant (thus keeping the global E/I ratio fixed for the modeled cell). This created a range of E/I ratio SD values, ranging from very tight E/I ratio variance, where each segment within a given domain has a similar ratio of E and I synapses (Fig. 7A , the balanced case, left), to the extreme case, in which each branch in a given domain had either only excitatory or only inhibitory synapses (Fig. 7B , the unbalanced case, left). Manipulation of the variance of segment-specific E/I ratio had a strong effects on predicted dendritic voltage dynamics (Fig. 7A-B , right): variation in dendritic voltage (including active dendritic spiking and back propagating action potentials (Material and Methods in Fig. 7A-7B ) in balanced segments is dampened and overall more hyperpolarized (Figure 7A , right) compared to the unbalanced E and I cases (Fig. 7B, right ). In the case of minimal variance of local E/I ratio per segment, the voltage distribution was narrower and very similar to that predicted from the biologically-observed E/I ratio (compare blue to green lines in Fig. 7C ). We found that terminal domains which, experimentally, had a near-balanced E/I ratio (Fig. 5 ) were highly sensitive to increasing the E/I ratio variance: gradually increasing the variance of E/I ratio among segments resulted in a gradual increase of the mean dendritic voltage time-integral (Fig. 7D ). This was not the case for intermediate domains with biologically unbalanced E/I ratio, where the change in variance of E/I ratio between segments had minimal effect on the dendritic voltage time-integral (Fig. 7G and see Material and Methods). This is likely due to the small contribution of intermediate synapses to the voltage perturbations in those domains, possibly as a result of their small relative number: indeed, if we perform our simulations after removing the synapses in intermediate domains, of the voltage integral was reduced by less than 1%, compared to 10-30% in the terminal domains (Fig. S7A ). The somatic firing rate in the 10 modeled cells was also strongly affected by the domain-specific E/I SD value (keeping the global E/I balance fixed per cell). Indeed, when testing the combined effect of differences in the global E/I ratio for different modeled cells together with the effect of the domainspecific E/I SD, we found a high correlation ( " = 0.7, dashed line) between somatic firing rate and global E/I ratio (Figure 7F ). Not surprisingly, cells with larger relative number of excitatory synapses fire at higher rates. Strikingly, in all modeled cells, the output firing rate increases as much as twofold per cell when the domain specific E/I ratio SD was increased, suggesting that the local E/I ratio (in addition to the global E/I ratio) must be considered for understanding how synaptic activity shapes the neuron's output. Our experimentally-based modeling demonstrates that in L2/3 PNs, E/I ratio is optimally-balanced in key dendritic domains; this domain-specific, local E/I balance at the level of dendritic segments constrains dendritic voltage fluctuations, and controls to a significant extent the firing rate of these neurons (Figures 7F and S6 ). DISCUSSION Mapping the spatial organization of synapses across the entire dendritic arbor of individual neurons is crucial for bridging the gap between our understanding of the molecular determinants of synaptic development and the principles of neural circuit connectivity. Here, we developed an adaptable, opensource toolkit for mapping the morphology and spatial distribution of all E and I synapses across complete neurons. This method has several key benefits for mapping subcellular synaptic morphology and distribution. As part of the Vaa3D image annotation platform, Synapse Detector is fully integrated into Vaa3D automatic pipeline for image segmentation, 3D image stitching, and surface reconstruction (36, 51, 52) . Synapse Detector is compatible with any fluorescent imaging method including high resolution confocal microscopy. Most importantly, Synapse Detector provides a generalizable toolkit for quantifying and mapping features of subcellular fluorescent marker distribution. The synaptic mapping pipeline developed here enabled the reconstruction of 12 L2/3 PNs, including the location and morphology of over 90,000 E and I synapses. Previous anatomical studies of the synaptic morphology and connectivity of this cell type allowed validation of our platform and observed results (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) . Our 3D reconstruction method for dendritic spines closely matched estimates from manual reconstructions of L2/3 PN spine density and morphology generated by tracing synapses from serial focal planes (26) . We also observed inhibitory synaptic distributions consistent with previous observations, as well as a common proportion of inhibitory synapses targeted to spines (9, 34, 35) . Strikingly, the distribution of specific synaptic features characterizing mouse L2/3 PNs recapitulates known motifs of circuit connectivity: in L2/3 PNs, dually innervated spines almost exclusively correspond to dendritic spines receiving thalamic inputs, and these synapses were significantly enriched in the L1 apical tufts and deep L3 basal dendrites, the two layers targeted by thalamic afferents from POm and VPL that innervate S1 (27, 28) . Analyzing the distribution of E and I synapses across complete dendritic arbors has revealed several scales of structured organization within L2/3 PNs. E and I synaptic distribution also varies significantly across dendritic domains, with fewer spines located in proximal than along distal dendritic segments, similar to what has been observed in CA1 PNs, potentially suggesting a shared principle for synaptic organization between these PN subtypes (40, 41) . Crucially, within-neuron comparisons of observed and randomized synaptic locations enabled the identification of structured distribution of E and I synapses to a restricted subset of dendritic segments within each domain. The formation of hotspots of synaptic density is consistent with known cellular mechanisms promoting spatially clustered synaptic stabilization and potentiation at the scale of single dendritic segments (47, 53) . Active properties of dendrites critical for initiating clustered potentiation are engaged in somatosensory and visual cortical PNs during sensory processing, raising the tantalizing possibility that these hotspots of synaptic density might represent a structural signature of salient feature storage within neuronal dendrites (8, (54) (55) (56) . A novel feature of structured synaptic distribution that emerged from our study is the strong, branchspecific, and local balance between E and I synaptic density across terminal dendritic segments. This suggests a far stronger association between E and I synaptic distribution than previous observations in vitro that the total number of E and I synapses are correlated across dendrites (2) . Indeed, while a conserved ratio of the number of E and I inputs across dendrites can be largely explained by longer dendrites receiving more inputs, our data strongly suggest that molecular mechanisms co-regulating the balance between E and I synaptic density must be acting at the scale of short dendritic segments. This spatial pattern closely matches the dendritic targeting of somatostatin-expressing interneurons, whose synapses onto L2/3 PNs were recently demonstrated to undergo NMDAR-dependent long term potentiation (25, 57, 58) . While the study of E/I balance at the level of single neurons has largely been restricted to feedforward inhibition mediated by perisomatic-targeting basket interneurons, our wholeneuron synaptic input maps suggest that a precise balance between excitation and inhibition is critical for dendritic integration as well (23, 59) . This novel principle of local E/I balance within dendritic segments has significant implications for dendritic integration. Indeed, our simulations show that disrupting the biologically-observed dendritic E/I balance in terminal dendrites dramatically enhances local dendritic voltage fluctuations and the initiation of local dendritic non-linearities, resulting in increased firing at the soma. Our first-ever complete mapping of E and I synapses over the whole dendritic tree of a subtype of PNs, combined with detailed simulations, suggest that the fine-tuned spatial balance of E and I synapses we observed strongly impacts local dendritic computation as well as the global input/output dynamics of cortical neurons within a network. Finally, we provide here the open-source synaptic reconstruction tools we have developed as well as our complete data set of 12 pyramidal neuron input maps containing information about the size, shape, and placement of over 90,000 E and I synapses publicly available upon acceptance. (Right) Voltage traces in the various distal apical branches for the balanced case in response to activation of all excitatory synapses (6,274 in total) and inhibitory synapses (1,111 in total) as measured experimentally for this cell. Back propagating action potentials are marked by an asterisk. (B) Same as in A for maximal E/I SD (the unbalanced case). In both A and B, the total number of E and I synapses in the distal apical domain is fixed as found experimentally (same global balance for the two cases). Note that back-propagating action potentials (large depolarizing transient) exhibit higher frequencies in the unbalanced case. (C) The probability of voltage integral for all branches in the basal terminal domain at the modeled cell. The distribution of the dendritic voltage time-integral expected for the experimentally-measured case (green line) closely fits that expected in the balanced case (blue line); both are narrower and less depolarized as compared to that obtained in the unbalanced case (red line). (F) Correlation between the somatic firing rate and the global E/I ratio for the 10 modeled cells. In each case (numbered vertical lines), the domain-specific E/I SD varied from the fully balanced case (blue) to the maximally unbalanced case (red). Numbers at each vertical line correspond to the modeled cell identity. In all cases, the numbers for activated E and I synapses were taken from the experimental counts; excitatory synapses were all activated randomly with an average rate of 1.75 Hz and inhibitory synapses were activated at 10 Hz. See details in Material and Methods. forms of long-term potentiation (5, 45, 46) . We calculate the path distances between these nodes and the soma, which is the 3D distance on the dendritic arbor from the soma to the node of interest. We calculate the distances between consecutive nodes that are in "ancestor-descendent" relationships on the neuronal arbor by obtaining the absolute value of the difference between their path distances. FIGURE LEGENDS FIGURES Figure 1 To calculate the density of the synapses of interest at any given point on the dendritic arbor (the heat map), we count the synapses of interest that are within W µm of that point in terms of the path distance on the dendritic arbor, and convert these counts into color codes. Smaller W values increase the resolution of the heat map. On the other hand, when W is too small, the heat map will display high frequency noise. Therefore, we set the W values adaptively for each dendritic arbor as W = min(8/λ, 100) λ = |S|/L where |S| denotes the number of synapses of interest, and L denotes the total dendritic length of the arbor so that the unit of λ is μm -1 . When mapping local counts to colors in the heat maps, we typically saturate the range of counts between the 2 nd and 98 th percentiles of the values to utilize the dynamic range of the colors more effectively. E/I balance heat map generation The excitatory and inhibitory heat map values for individual neurons are scaled and shifted to lie in the [0, 1] interval. The absolute value of the difference, which again lies in the [0, 1] interval, is displayed. Within-domain randomization for structural organization analysis For each neuron, we first find all the nodes of the arbor trace in the domain of interest. The nodes that carry synapses on them have extra annotations reflecting the size and type of the synapses. Then, we reassign the size-and-type annotations to those nodes uniformly at random, thus leaving the structure of the arbor unchanged. Branch-level synaptic rate correlation analysis For each relevant branch (i.e., primary, intermediate, terminal) in each neuron, we count the synapses of interest and divide by the path length of that branch to obtain the density estimate. We calculate the correlation coefficient and the p-value pair for each plot using the corrcoef command in MATLAB. Analysis software The software used to generate the heat maps, the rate plots, and the within-domain randomization results is available at https://github.com/uygarsumbul/spines. Quantification and statistical analysis of synaptic distribution data Data is shown as the mean ± SEM, unless otherwise stated. T-tests was used to compare the mean of two groups with corrections for multiple comparisons: discovery determined using the Two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli, with Q = 1%. A one-way ANOVA was used when more than two groups existed. Significance for all experiments was placed at p < 0.05. Statistical tests were carried out with GraphPad Prism. Modeling Reconstructed morphological data, synaptic attributes and spatial distribution of E and I synapses were taken from Vaa3D reconstructions. Modeling and simulation was performed using NEURON simulator, accessed using a python script (62) . Specific membrane resistance and capacitance, and axial resistance were 12,000 Ωcm " , 1 µF/cm " , 150 Ωcm, respectively. These values were chosen such that the somatic input resistance and time constant will be within known biological ranges for these neurons (92 ± 15Ω and 12 , respectively (63)). Active membrane ion channels were taken from the Blue Brain Project models of L2/3 PNs (64) and tuned to produce similar results to that found in vivo for L2/3 PNs (60). The activation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses was randomly sampled from a Poisson distribution with an average of 1.75 Hz and 10 Hz for the E and I synapses, respectively. This generated a mean somatic firing rate for the 10 modeled cells of 4.6 ± 3.6 Hz, similar to that found experimentally (31) . The synaptic peak conductance for the Esynapses was 0.4 nS (for α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) component as well as for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) components) and 1 nS for the γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABAA) synapses. The rise time constants for the conductances of these synapses was 0.2 ms, 2.04 ms and 0.18 ms, respectively and the respective decay time was 1.7 ms, 75.2 ms and 1.7 ms. The reversal potential values are 0 mV, 0 mV, and -80 mV, respectively. Dendritic voltage traces were recorded from the center of the respective dendritic branch. Fitting model to in vitro experiment results To ensure that our model captures important aspects of dendritic nonlinearities and voltage attenuation, we tuned the Na + and Ih membrane conductances to replicate two experiments as in Waters et al, 2003. In order to replicate the attenuation of the back-propagating action potential along the apical trunk in L2/3 PN as in Figure 6C , a step depolarization current of 200 pA for 200 ms was injected to the modelled soma, invoking a somatic action potential, and recorded the amplitude at 10 µm intervals along the apical trunk (Figure 6D ). To replicate the contribution of Na + channels to the backpropagation of action potentials (Figure 6E ), we have injected 200 pA for 200 ms to the soma, invoking an action potential, and recorded the voltage both at the soma and 80 µm from the soma on the apical trunk. Then, we simulated the application of TTX by removing the Na + channels from the model, voltage clamping the soma to the voltage trace created by the action potential, and recording the amplitude of the passively propagated action potential 80 µm from the soma on the apical trunk (Figure 6F ). The model (Figures 6D and 6F ) was able to replicate the experimental results (Figures 6C and 6E ) of both the attenuation and the dependency on Na+ channels of the back-propagating action potential. As found experimentally (31) , our L23 PN models produced a range of firing rates; some cells fire at high rate (10 Hz, red circle in Figures 6G-6I recorded) and some fire at low rate (3 Hz, blue circle in Figures 6G-6I ). This variance in somatic firing rate persisted despite that fact that all models have the same passive and active properties and E and I input frequencies. We found that the global E/I balance per cell (Figure 6G ) was a strong indicator of the output firing rate (Figure 7F ). Additionally, we found that the somatic firing rate is correlated with the size of the cell, the larger the surface area of the cell, the lower is its firing rate (Figure 6H ). This is due to the interesting experimental finding that larger cells have lower global E/I ratio and, consequently, that their firing rate is lower (Figure 6I ). Changing E/I ratio variance across dendritic domains To study the influence of the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a given dendritic branch, we iteratively increased or decreased the variance of E/I ratios over all branches belonging to a given domain. To change the E/I ratio variance, we randomly distributed the location of synapses between branches, while keeping the total number of synapses in the domain fixed (as found experimentally for the respective modeled cell). This process was repeated ten times, each time with a different initial distribution of the synapses. In Figures 7D and 7E and Figure S6 the voltage time integral (in a time window of 3000 sec) was computed at the center of each branch in a particular domain, for different E/I SD, averaged over all branches in that domain. The same was performed for the somatic firing rates (Figure 7F ) for different E/I SD in the basal terminal domain. Contribution of synapses in a domain to voltage in that domain To measure the contribution of synapses located in a specific domain to the depolarization in that domain, we simulated each of the modeled cell with excitatory and inhibitory synapses as described above, and calculated the mean voltage time-integral in each domain. We then calculated the respective mean voltage time-integral when all synapses in that domain were not active and compared the two cases (Figure S7A ). SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT Computational pipeline overview Information for dendritic spine placement and morphology was acquired from large-volume high-resolution image stacks of thick brain tissue. There are two possible strategies for quantifying the spatial distribution of excitatory and inhibitory (E and I) synapses of an entire neuron: 1. Stitch image volumes together prior to analysis. 2. Analyze each image volume independently and align the spatial information recorded from each image to create a complete neuron representation. The first strategy, which involves all the image stacks into a terabyte volume and then perform neuron tracing, synapse segmentation and spatial analysis globally on the combined volume. The downside of the approach is a big data problem of manipulating, storing and analyzing the giant volume. Additionally, this approach is computationally wasteful because only a fraction of the stitched volume contains relevant structure. To avoid this big data problem, we pursued the alternative strategy of performing dendrite tracing and synapse segmentation on each image stack individually and associating morphological information of each synapse to a specific node of the trace (thereby encoding the location of every synapse within the spatial context of the neuron). To create representations of complete neurons across serial vibratome sections, dendrite traces containing synaptic information were aligned and stitched together. In comparison with the terabyte combined volume generated by the first reconstruction strategy, the resulting reconstructions are 4-6 megabytes in size. Our pipeline for whole-neuron synaptic reconstruction consists of two parts. In the first part, we extract E and I synaptic information for an individual image across a tissue section (Figure S1A ). For each image stack, we trace the dendritic arbor of the neuron fragment using automatic tracing methods followed by manual corrections. Then both Spine Detector and IS Detector take the neuron skeleton and the image stack as input to automatically isolate spines and inhibitory synapses within a user-defined radius of each dendrite. Spine Detector generates a table that records the local information of dendritic spines including the distance between each synapse and the dendrite, volume, and the nearest tree node. IS Detector generates a table that records the local information of inhibitory synapses including volume, whether the inhibitory synapse is located on a spine or the dendrite, and the nearest tree node. These morphological characteristics of synapses impact their neurotransmitter content and integration properties (43, (65) (66) (67) . In the second part of our reconstruction pipeline, we map E and I synaptic morphology across multiple images for whole-neuron spatial distribution analysis (Figure S1B ). First, the dendritic spine information and inhibitory synaptic information from each image are mapped to the closest tree node of their corresponding dendrite trace. Next, the traces containing local synaptic information from each image stack are aligned and stitched together to generate a whole-neuron synaptic reconstruction. Notably, the association between synapses and their respective tree nodes remains unchanged during the assembly. After obtaining the single reconstruction trace of the whole neuron, we subtype the dendritic arbor in terms of identity and morphology so that we can analyze the synaptic features within domain and segment levels. Neuron reconstruction Digital reconstructions, or traces, are an effective representation of neuronal topology and geometry. The traces are usually described using a tree graph and consist of 3-D point coordinates, diameters, and connectivity between points. This succinct representation enables an extensive quantitative analyses of the geometrical organization of the neurons they represent including total length, branching angles, distribution statistics and cumulative distance from the soma (68) . Numerous automated tracing methods have been developed (69) (70) (71) . In this paper, the initial reconstructions are obtained using the automatic tracing methods built in the open source 3D visualization and analysis tool Vaa3D (52) . Then, experts manually proofread the traces and make adjustments with the built-in proof-editing tools. Notably our synapse analysis pipeline works for traces generated by all tracing methods. Accurate reconstructions are important to improve the performance of automatic synapse detection. Automatic spine detection To automatically identify potential spines, Spine Detector segments candidate spine-associated voxels whose fluorescence is greater than a linearly interpolated local threshold between nodes along the closest dendritic segment (72) . Spine detection is performed within a user-defined region around the dendrite and intensity threshold such that all voxels within the user-defined region and above the threshold are identified possible spine voxels. Spine Detector takes both the image and the dendritic trace as input and clusters adjacent voxels in the cell-fill channel based on their distance from the dendrite surface. Touching spines are separated based on voxel intensities. Because the dendrite traces represent the dendrites with a series of overlapping nodes (73) , information about the volume and distance from the dendrite of each spine can be associated with its nearest node to assign a location within the spatial context of the dendritic arbor. Voxel clustering for enhanced detection In contrast to previous approaches that estimate spine volume from the spine tip backward toward the dendrite ( 72 ), Spine Detector identifies potential spine voxels at the dendrite shaft and estimates their volume by iteratively adding layers of connected voxels toward the spine tips. To quickly estimate the minimum distance between each voxel and the nearest dendrite surface, Spine Detector uses the radius of each node across the neuron trace as a representation of the dendrite surface and performs a distance transform on the image (Figures S2C and S2D ). The initial seeds of potential spines are the voxels the shortest distance from the dendrite surface. In each iteration, potential spines are identified and grown by adding new layers of connected neighbor-voxels until a spine edge is detected. This is achieved by establishing a floor value to the distance between the initial seeds and the dendrite surface and repeatedly adding layers of connected neighbor-voxels equal to the floor value of the previous layer. At the end of each iteration, Spine Detector determines whether the number of voxels have exceeded the user-defined spine size and whether the maximum layer width has exceeded the user-defined layer width. If the most recently added layer did not meet these criteria, all previous layers are discarded and the voxels in that layer serve as the seed for the next layer. The iteration stops when all qualified voxels are assessed. Spine candidates are rejected based on user-supplied parameters for minimum voxel count and minimum spine length, allowing users to reconstruct images acquired at different magnifications. Notably, spines can be detected with this methodology regardless of the resolution of the spine neck. Intensity-based segmentation of adjacent spines Limited image resolution, inaccurate thresholding, and physical proximity can all give rise to adjacent spines incorrectly categorized as a single synapse. Based on the observation that spine voxel intensities are naturally brighter at the center than the edges, we adopted an adapted watershed algorithm to separate spines within close spatial proximity (74) . First an initial threshold is set at a relatively high fluorescence intensity so that only the center-voxels of spines are identified (Figure S2E ). With the successively decreasing fluorescence toward the spine border, the spine boundary grows in size. When two potential spine boundaries meet they each become defined to separate adjacent spines. The merger of two spine volumes is only considered when both spines are relatively small (lower than 1% of the average volume). Inhibitory synapse detection We labeled inhibitory synapses using the scaffolding protein Gephyrin tagged with a fluorescent protein as a marker (9) . Because these synapses can only occur on the dendrites or the spines of neurons of interest, we use the image from the cell-fill channel containing the dendrites and the spines as a mask image to extract the relevant region for the inhibitory synaptic marker. Then, signal beyond user-input parameters for minimum/maximum voxel count and distance from the trace is excluded and potential inhibitory synapses from the resulting image are identified based on a user-input intensity threshold. Users have the ability to accept or reject potential inhibitory synapses, adjust their volume, and assign them as dendrite-targeting or spine-targeting. Stitching neuron traces across serial 3D image sections To assemble the neuron reconstructions traced across multiple image stacks we used Neuron Stitcher (36), a software suite for stitching non-overlapping neuron fragments in serial 3D image sections. The software identifies severed neurite traces at the section planes, known as 'border tips', and then uses a triangle matching algorithm to align traces created from neurons spanning serial tissue sections. Once the initial border tip matches are identified, the alignment is estimated in the form of an affine transformation and the border tips are connected to form a complete neuron trace. Neurite subtyping To better understand the synaptic distribution within domain and segment levels, we developed the Subtree Labeling program as a plug-in of Vaa3D to subtype neurites for further analysis. Using this program it is possible to assign a neurite segment into multiple categories: axon, soma, apical trunk, apical tufts, apical oblique dendrites, and basal dendrites. The user interface allows the user to select the starting vertex for each branch and to assign neurite type. The program first finds the tree node for soma and sorts the tree with the soma node as the tree root. Then, all the child vertices of the starting vertex are assigned the same branch type as each manually annotated starting vertex. USER'S GUIDE Synapse Detector Interactive User Interface To broaden the utility of SynapseDetector to work with a variety of different data acquisition processes, we designed an interactive interface to (1) allow visual evaluation of detection results and accept or reject putative synapses; and (2) enable manual correction of synaptic volume through addition or subtraction of associated pixels. The software was implemented in C/C++ as a plugin of Vaa3D, which is a publicly available open source platform with a user-friendly interface for 3D+ image analysis and visualization. In the following sections, we will introduce how to use the tools. For detailed directions how to create neuron traces using Vaa3D, see the recently published protocol (52) .

This plugin connects nodes that were not linked during manual trace editing, which is critical for proper segment classification. This plugin allows the user to designate the soma as the "root node," the first node in the tree from which the distance to all daughter nodes can be determined to analyze synaptic distribution. 1. In Vaa3D, drag a neuron trace into the 3D viewer. 2. Use 'Cmd/Ctrl+L' to toggle between the line (skeleton) display mode and the surface mesh display mode of the neuron. In line display mode it is possible to visualize root nodes contained within the trace. 3. If the trace contains a soma, hover cursor over soma to identify the node number that will be designated as the root node. 4. In Vaa3D, go to the 'Plug-in' main window menu and click 'neuron_utilities', then click on 'sort_neuron_swc', and finally click on 'sort_swc'. 5. Select the trace in the 'Open from 3D Viewer' tab. 6. If the trace contains a soma, specify the root node number as the soma node number. If the trace does not contain a soma, click 'cancel'. 7. Specify a voxel threshold for adjacent segments to be connected. To connect all segments click 'cancel'. Save the sorted neuron trace. Resampling dendrite traces for reconstruction To maximize the spatial resolution of synaptic distribution analysis, it is recommended to resample the associated neuron trace to contain the highest possible number of tree nodes. 1. In Vaa3D, go to the 'Plug-in' main window menu and click 'neuron_utilities', then click on 'resample_swc', and finally click on 'resample'. 2. Select the trace and specify a step length of 1. Click 'ok' and save the resampled neuron trace. Using Crop Image Trace to analyze large image volumes This new tool allows the user to analyze image volumes with Synapse Detector that would normally be too large by cropping a region of interest based on XYZ pixel coordinates and aligning an associated neuron trace to the resulting image volume. In practice, image volumes greater than 2000 x 2000 pixels in X and Y and 500 pixels in Z are difficult to reconstruct without cropping. 1. In Vaa3D, use 'Cmd/Ctrl+O' to open the appropriate image file. 2. In the tri-view window, click 'see in 3D' and then click 'entire image' to visualize the image file. 3. Drag and drop the neuron trace corresponding to the image file into the 3D view window. 5. Click 'Save current result' to save intermediate results during proofreading. Spine Detector will generate 2 files in the output folder: a text file (includes all info needed to reload the last saved reconstruction project) and a csv file (table of accepted spine information). 6. Click 'Finish proofreading' to save final results after proofreading. After proofreading is completed, Spine Detector generates 2 image files (unedited and edited inhibitory synapses), a marker file of synaptic positions, and a csv file containing synaptic morphology data (all data measured in pixels). Embedding synaptic data within the neuron trace After spines and inhibitory synapses have been annotated throughout the image volume, synaptic information stored in tables can be associated with their corresponding nodes throughout the neuron trace using the Synapse Detector Combiner. 1. In Vaa3D, go to the 'Plug-in' main window menu click 'synapse_detector', and click on 'Combiner'. 2. Load the spine and inhibitory synapse tables that correspond to the neuron trace. If the image volume was cropped before reconstruction the trace will be associated with tables from each cropped region. Click 'Run', and save the neuron reconstruction. Assembling reconstruction fragments with Neuron Stitcher For detailed directions how to stitch neuron traces using Neuron Stitcher, see the recently published protocol (36) . To preserve synaptic information within the reconstruction, assemble reconstruction fragments to produce an eswc trace. Annotating reconstruction traces with Subtree Labeling This new tool creates an enhanced neuron skeleton that contains information about dendrite identity, branch order, and cumulative dendritic distance from the soma. The user interface allows the user to select the starting vertex for each branch and to assign neurite type. Child vertices of each starting vertex are assigned the same branch type as each manually annotated starting vertex. To label neuron reconstructions stitched from multiple fragments throughout the entire dendritic arbor, these traces must first be sorted with the Neuron Connector plugin to preserve the eswc file type.

DATA ACQUISITION Mice All animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University, New York. Postnatal day 42 CD-1 IGS mice (strain code: 022; Charles River) were used for all experiments. Timed-pregnant female mice were maintained in a 12 hour light/dark cycle and obtained by overnight breeding with males of the same strain. For timed-pregnant mating, noon after mating is considered E0.5. Constructs The tdTomato reporter insert was subcloned into the pAAV-Ef1a-DIO eNpHR 3.0-EYFP plasmid (Addgene plasmid # 26966) between the AscI and NheI cloning sites. EGFP-GPHN (clone P1) was obtained from H. Cline (TSRI, La Jolla, USA) and subcloned into pCAG downstream of a CMV-enhancer/chicken-β-actin (CAG) promoter, by replacing EGFP between the XmaI and NotI cloning sites. In utero electroporation In utero cortical electroporation was performed at E15.5 on timed pregnant CD1 females. The previously described protocol for in utero cortical electroporation (61) was modified as follows. Endotoxin-free DNA was injected using a glass pipette into one ventricle of the mouse embryos. The volume of injected DNA was adjusted depending on the experiments. Electroporation was performed at E15.5 using a square wave electroporator (ECM 830, BTX) and gold paddles. The electroporation settings were: 5 pulses of 45 V for 50 ms with 500 ms intervals. Plasmids were used at the following concentrations: Flex-tdTomato reporter plasmid: 1 µg/µl; EGFP-GPHN 0.5 µg/µl; NLS-Cre recombinase: 0.0002 µg/µl. Tissue preparation Animals at the indicated age were anaesthetized with isofluorane before intracardiac perfusion with PBS and 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences). 130 μm coronal brain sections were obtained using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1200S). Sections were mounted on slides and briefly dehydrated at room temperature to reduce section thickness before being coverslipped in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). Confocal imaging Confocal images of electroporated neurons in slices were acquired in 1024x1024 mode using an A1R laser scanning 11 confocal microscope controlled by the Nikon software NIS-Elements (Nikon Corporation, Melville, NY). We used a 100X H-TIRF, NA 1.49 (Nikon) objective lens to acquire image volumes of neuron fragments. Z-stacks of images were acquired with spacing of 100 nm. To counteract possible interference from light diffraction through the tissue, laser power was linearly increased as a function of depth within each tissue section to normalize the mean fluorescent intensity of pixels from image planes throughout the stack (Figure S2A ). Dendritic spines and inhibitory synapses were quantified based on tdTomato fluorescence and EGFP-GPHN puncta fluorescence respectively. All quantifications were performed in L2/3 somatosensory cortex in sections of comparable rostro-caudal position. Heat map generation We query the synaptic annotations for individual neurons to return a subset of the synapses satisfying the query. Some examples are "all inhibitory synapses," "large spines," and "all inhibitory synapses on spines." We classified "large" synapses as greater than the 20 th percentile of synaptic volume for each neuron, closely corresponding to the persistent 160% increase in volume reported for synapses following structural Synapse annotation with Synapse Detector This new tool semi-automatedly identifies dendritic spines (Spine Detector) or inhibitory synapses (IS Detector) and quantifies their morphology and spatial distribution. Synapses can be manually accepted or rejected, as well as edited by dilating or eroding pixels. IS Detector also allows the user to designate inhibitory synapse location on either a spine or the dendritic shaft. Spine Detector user interface 1. In Vaa3D, go to the 'Plug-in' main window menu, click 'synapse_detector', and click on 'SpineDetector_NewProject'. Users can also continue an existing project by clicking 'SpineDetector_ExisitingProject'. 2. Load the image volume (v3dpbd or v3draw), associated trace file (swc), and designate an output destination for the sorted reconstruction. Select the color channel of the cell-fill. 3. Specify the threshold for background signal in the image and volume parameters for potential spines. Pixel to micron conversion can be calculated from the imaging magnification and is usually stored within the image properties. Click 'Run'. 4. Click 'Proofread by segment' to edit spines along a dendrite segment (recommended) or 'Proofread by spine' to edit each spine individually. 5. Accept/reject potential spines and proofread spine morphology by dilating/eroding volume. The highlighted regions indicate the potential spines (Figure S1C ). It is recommended to look at the segment at different angles and toggle between views with the spine annotation channel on and off in the 3D viewer. 6. Click 'Save current result' to save intermediate results during proofreading. Spine Detector will generate 4 files in the output folder: a text file 'project.txt' (includes all info needed to reload the last saved reconstruction project), a marker file indicating the positions of accepted/rejected spines, a csv file (table of accepted spine information), and an image file of accepted spines. 7. Click 'Finish proofreading' to save final results after proofreading. After proofreading is completed, Spine Detector generates 2 image files (edited spine reconstruction and isolated spine annotations), a marker file of spine positions, and a csv file containing spine morphology data (all data measured in pixels). IS Detector user interface 1. In Vaa3D, go to the 'Plug-in' main window menu, click 'synapse_detector', and click on 'IS_Detector_NewProject'. Users can also click on 'IS_Detector_ExisitingProject' to reload a previously saved project. 2. Load the image volume (v3dpbd or v3draw), associated trace file (swc), and designate an output destination for the sorted reconstruction. Select the color channel of the cell-fill and the color channel of the inhibitory synaptic marker (or other punctate intracellular marker). 3. Specify the threshold for background signal in both image channels and volume parameters for potential inhibitory synapses. Pixel to micron conversion can be calculated from the imaging magnification and is usually stored within the image properties. Click 'Run', and then click 'Proofread by segment'. 4. Accept/reject potential inhibitory synapses and proofread morphology by dilating/eroding volume and specifying synapse location on spine/dendrite. The highlighted regions indicate the potential inhibitory synapses (Figure S1D ). It is recommended to adjust the lookup table thresholds for synaptic visualization by clicking the 'Vol Colormap' button on the right-side control pane of the 3D viewer.

Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor RNAs is responsible for greatly expanding the regulatory and functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes. Of the different classes of AS, intron retention (IR) is the least well understood. In plants and unicellular eukaryotes, IR is the most common form of AS, whereas in animals, it is thought to represent the least prevalent form. Using high-coverage poly(A) + RNA-seq data, we observe that IR is surprisingly frequent in mammals, affecting transcripts from as many as three-quarters of multiexonic genes. A highly correlated set of cis features comprising an ''IR code'' reliably discriminates retained from constitutively spliced introns. We show that IR acts widely to reduce the levels of transcripts that are less or not required for the physiology of the cell or tissue type in which they are detected. This ''transcriptome tuning'' function of IR acts through both nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and nuclear sequestration and turnover of IR transcripts. We further show that IR is linked to a cross-talk mechanism involving localized stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and reduced availability of spliceosomal components. Collectively, the results implicate a global checkpoint-type mechanism whereby reduced recruitment of splicing components coupled to Pol II pausing underlies widespread IR-mediated suppression of inappropriately expressed transcripts. [Supplemental material is available for this article.] Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread process by which splice sites in primary transcripts are differentially utilized to produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms (Pan et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Nilsen and Graveley 2010) . It is regulated by the complex interplay of cis-and trans-acting factors that serve to promote or repress the assembly of productive splicing complexes, referred to as spliceosomes. Alternative ''cassette'' exon splicing is thought to represent the most frequent type of AS in animals and has been implicated in the control of diverse aspects of normal and disease biology (Kalsotra and Cooper 2011; Irimia and Blencowe 2012) . In contrast, intron retention (IR), the process by which specific introns remain unspliced in polyadenylated transcripts, is thought to represent the least prevalent form of AS in animals (Galante et al. 2004; Sakabe and de Souza 2007; Wang et al. 2008) , whereas it is the most frequent form in plants, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes (Ner-Gaon et al. 2004; Marquez et al. 2012; Seb e-Pedr os et al. 2013) . Previous studies have shown that IR functions in the homeostatic control of the expression of some RNA processing and export factors (Kalyna et al. 2006; Li et al. 2006; Lareau et al. 2007; Ge and Porse 2013) . More recently, it has emerged that IR also controls the expression of developmentally regulated genes in plants and animals (Kalyna et al. 2012; Yap et al. 2012; Wong et al. 2013) . For example, a set of retained introns in a murine neuroblastoma cell line was shown to negatively regulate genes with neural-associated functions. Several of these introns were linked to nuclear retention and exosome-mediated RNA turnover of the host transcripts (Yap et al. 2012) . In contrast, another set of IR events was found to control the levels of transcripts important for granulocyte maturation (Wong et al. 2013) , largely through the process of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). These recent studies suggest that different IR events control gene expression through distinct mechanisms. However, the extent to which IR operates across different primary cells and tissues to regulate gene expression via these and possibly additional mechanisms is not known. By applying a new pipeline for IR detection to high coverage poly(A) + RNA-seq data from more than 40 diverse human and mouse cell and tissue types, we have performed the most comprehensive analysis of IR to date in mammals. We find that IR is far more frequent in mammals than previously appreciated, affecting transcripts from most genes. A set of distinct cis features reliably discriminates this greatly expanded set of retained introns from introns that undergo constitutive splicing. These retained introns comprise three main classes with distinct evolutionary origins. We further provide evidence that retained introns act widely to functionally ''tune'' transcriptomes by further reducing the expression of relatively low abundance transcripts that often lack physiological relevance to the cells and tissues they are detected in. Finally, we show that IR is tightly linked to the increased occupancy of RNA Pol II over the corresponding intronic sequence at the genomic level and to reduced levels of core splicing factors. Our results thus suggest that bidirectional cross-talk between Pol II and IR as a consequence of reduced splicing factor recruitment is an important and widespread mechanism that contributes to the functional tuning of mammalian cell and tissue transcriptomes. Results High prevalence of intron retention in mammalian transcriptomes To systematically detect IR in mammals, we discriminated retained from constitutively spliced introns using alignments of reads from poly(A) + RNA-seq data from ;40 cell and tissue types from human and mouse (Supplemental Table S1 ). Reads were aligned to a comprehensive set of reference sequences comprising exon-intron junctions, intron midpoint sequences, and exon-exon junctions formed by intron removal. The degree of IR was represented using the metric percent intron retention (PIR), the percentage of transcripts in which a given intron is retained. In brief, PIR was calculated as the percentage of the average number of reads mapping to the 59 and 39 exon-intron junctions, over the sum of the average of the exon-intron junction reads plus the exon-exon junction reads. Additionally, we required a balanced accumulation of reads mapping to 59 and 39 exon-intron junctions and to intron midpoint sequences (Fig. 1A ). These and additional steps were also used to distinguish IR from alternative transcription initiation/ termination, alternative 59/39 splice-site selection, and/or overlap with transcripts from other genes including antisense loci (see Methods). IR was detected to variable extents between different cell and tissue types. In general, a higher proportion of introns were found to be retained in neural and immune cell types, whereas IR was detected less often in ES and muscle cells (Supplemental Fig. S1A, B ; see below). These differences in IR frequency are unlikely due to differences in read coverage, since the majority of analyzed RNA-seq data sets had a comparable degree of read depth (Supplemental Table S1 ). RT-PCR validation experiments on 25 representative examples of IR detected by our analysis pipeline, using cell and tissue RNA samples from independent sources from those used to generate the RNA-seq data, confirmed the presence of IR in all cases (Methods; Supplemental Fig. S2 ). Moreover, measurements of cell/tissue-differential PIR by RNA-seq correlated well with corresponding measurements of PIR by RT-PCR (r = 0.63, P < 2.2 3 10 À16 , Pearson correlation) (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). To estimate the total proportions of human and mouse introns that may be subjected to retention, we determined the frequency of IR detection after randomly sampling increasing numbers of cell and tissue RNA-seq data sets. Remarkably, ;53% and 51% of all human and mouse introns, respectively, have the potential to be retained in poly(A) + transcripts at a PIR $ 10 in at least one of the cell or tissue types, and ;9% and 8% have the potential to be retained at a PIR $ 50 (Fig. 1B ; Supplemental Fig. S1C ). Moreover, ;77% of human and mouse multiexonic genes contain one or more retained introns with a PIR $ 10, and 35% contain one or more retained introns with a PIR $ 50% (Fig. 1C ; Supplemental Fig. S1D ). These results reveal that the frequency of IR compares with the frequency of cassette exon AS (Pan et al. 2008) and is far more prevalent in mammalian cells and tissues than previously detected using lower coverage RNA-seq data (Wang et al. 2008) . Distinguishing features and classes of retained introns Consistent with previous reports (Galante et al. 2004; Sakabe and de Souza 2007) , retained introns are on average shorter, more C/G rich, and associated with weaker splice sites than are constitutive introns (all tests P < 0.001, one-sided Mann-Whitney U test) (Supplemental Fig. S3 ). We used logistic regression to determine whether these and additional cis features, or an ''IR code,'' can be used to reliably discriminate retained from constitutively spliced Figure 1 . Detection and prevalence of intron retention. (A) Intron retention was detected by aligning RNA-seq reads to comprehensive sets of exon-intron and exon-exon junctions. Reads mapping to midintron sequences and balanced counts of reads aligning to upstream and downstream exon-intron sequences were used to discriminate IR from other forms of transcript variation. IR levels were measured using percent intron retention (PIR): 1003 mean retention reads over the sum of retention and spliced intron reads (see Methods for details).

The main graph quantifies, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, how well individual features or a logistic regression model comprising 136 features (''Complete IR code'') (Supplemental Table S2 ) distinguish retained (PIR $ 10) from constitutive (PIR < 2) introns in neural tissues. See Methods for details. The graph on the upper right shows the receiver operating characteristic of the complete IR code with area under the curve (AUC) indicated. (TPR) True positive rate; (FPR) false positive rate. E1/E2 are 59/39 exons, respectively. introns, as detected by our analysis pipeline. The logistic model confirmed that retained introns are significantly associated with elevated C/G content, reduced length, and relatively weak 59 and 39 splice sites. However, additional features are also predicted to be important, including elevated C/G content in flanking exonic sequences, the ratios of the lengths of the intron and upstream exon to the length of the downstream exon, and the location of the intron within the gene body. Remarkably, although many of these features are highly correlated with each other, when combined, they more reliably discriminate retained from constitutively spliced introns (ROC AUC = 0.79, P < 1 3 10 À300 ) (Fig. 1D ; Supplemental Table S2 ). These results indicate that introns detected as retained in poly(A) + RNA by our pipeline are associated with a set of hallmark features that distinguishes them from general introns. To further investigate cis features that define IR events, we considered that retained introns comprise three distinct types with different evolutionary origins, designated below as Types A-C (Fig. 2A ; see Methods). Type A are ancestral introns flanked by constitutive exons, Type B arose by ''intronization'' of ancestral exonic sequence (Irimia et al. 2008) , and Type C are located adjacent to one or more alternative exons that may or may not be conserved between species. Separating retained introns according to this classification reveals markedly different features. Type A introns are the most frequent and, relative to Type B and C, have an intermediate C/G content and length, and are the most weakly retained (Figs. 2B-D ; Supplemental Fig. S4A-C ). Type B represent the smallest fraction of retained introns and, consistent with their intra-exonic location, have the highest C/G content, the shortest length, the weakest splice sites, and the highest PIR values (Figs. 2B-D ; Supplemental Fig. S4A-D ). Type C are intermediate in number, have the lowest C/G content, and are longer than Type A and B introns, which suggest a relatively recent evolution that may be tied to the flanking alternative exons (Figs. 2B-D ; Supplemental Fig. S4A-C ). Retained introns thus comprise a heterogeneous group harboring distinct features and PIR levels that likely reflect different evolutionary origins and functional properties. Evolutionary conservation of IR across vertebrate species To gain insight into which cell and tissue differential IR events may have conserved functions, we next examined the extent to which IR events are conserved between the equivalent organs (whole brain, cerebellum, heart, muscle, liver, kidney, and testis) from up to 11 vertebrate species spanning ;440 million years of evolution (see Fig. 3A ). Similar to cassette exon AS (Barbosa-Morais et al. 2012; Merkin et al. 2012) , IR has diverged rapidly in all tissues during vertebrate evolution, although to a considerably lesser extent in the brain than in organs such as testis, which shows the most divergent IR profiles (Fig. 3A ; Supplemental Fig. S5A ). Hierarchically clustering tissue samples by their transcriptomewide PIR profiles results in the segregation of most brain tissues from primate species, whereas other samples generally cluster according to species; testis is an exception due to its high heterogeneity of PIR patterns (Fig. 3B , see legend). Similar results were obtained using principal component analysis (Supplemental Fig. S5B ). These results thus suggest that IR, although having diverged rapidly in all analyzed vertebrate organs, more often provides conserved functions in the nervous system than in other tissues. Global regulation of mRNA levels through IR Retained introns, relative to constitutive introns, are enriched in untranslated regions (UTRs) and noncoding RNAs compared to protein-coding regions of genes (Figs. 1D, 2E ). Moreover, retained Figure 2 . Distinct types of retained introns and associated properties. (A) Classification of retained introns and associated properties. (B) Fractions of total human retained introns belonging to each evolutionary type at different PIR thresholds.

(Asterisks) P < 0.001 in two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. (E) Fraction of all human introns in each genic region that is retained with PIR $ 10 in $10% of the samples where PIR could be determined. (UTR) Untranslated region; (CDS) coding region of gene; (PTC) premature termination codon that can elicit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The total number of retained introns in each region is indicated. introns that are predicted not to introduce an NMD-eliciting premature termination codon (PTC) are detected at a significantly higher frequency in coding-overlapping regions than are retained introns that introduce a PTC (P < 4.2 3 10 À16 , Fisher's exact test). IR is also detected with increasing frequency toward the 39 ends of transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S6A ). Using ENCODE RNA-seq data generated from nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) + RNA (Tilgner et al. 2012) , we observe that this distribution pattern is detected in transcripts isolated from both cellular fractions (Supplemental Fig. S6B ), indicating that it is not simply a consequence of reduced kinetics of splicing of retained introns in nascent transcripts. Moreover, PIR levels are lower, overall, in cytoplasmic compared to nuclear transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S6C ). Taken together with the detection of prevalent IR (Fig. 1 ), these results suggest that cytoplasmic levels of transcripts containing retained introns may be reduced in diverse cells and tissues through nuclear restriction and NMD. Supporting this possibility, we observed a significant negative relationship between IR detection and steady-state transcript levels (Fig. 4A ; Supplemental Fig. S7A ). To confirm whether intron retention leading to NMD has a significant global impact on transcripts, we analyzed transcript levels using RNA-seq data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild-type mice and mice homozygous for a gene-trap (gt) insertion that disrupts Smg1 (McIlwain et al. 2010) , a kinase that is critical for NMD activity (Fig. 4B ). Transcripts with retained introns that introduce PTCs are expressed at significantly higher steady-state levels in the Smg1 gt/gt than wild-type MEFs, compared to transcripts with PTC-containing introns that are not retained (P = 1.5 3 10 À5 , one-sided Mann-Whitney U test) (Fig. 4B , upper panel). Moreover, ;10% of retained introns predicted to introduce PTCs display a pronounced (i.e., $15%) increase in PIR in Smg1 gt/gt compared to wild-type MEFs, whereas only 2% displayed a comparable decrease. In contrast, a significant difference in overall steady-state transcript level changes between wild-type and Smg1 gt/gt MEFs was not observed when comparing transcripts harboring either retained or constitutively spliced introns that are not predicted to introduce PTCs (Fig. 4B , lower panel). These results show that retained introns harboring PTCs contribute significantly to the global down-regulation of transcript levels via NMD. We next asked to what extent IR-mediated nuclear restriction versus NMD impacts steady-state transcript levels in the cytoplasm. Accordingly, we compared ratios of cytoplasmic to nuclear poly(A) + mRNA for transcripts that harbor retained introns that are, or are not, predicted to introduce PTCs (Fig. 4C ). These ratios were measured across a range of increasing nuclear PIR thresholds to determine how increased IR contributes to reduced levels of cytoplasmic transcripts. Importantly, as the PIR threshold increases in the nucleus, the levels of transcripts in the cytoplasm relative to the nucleus progressively decrease. This relationship is observed when the retained introns do not introduce a PTC (indicative of nuclear retention and turnover), but it is significantly enhanced when the retained introns introduce a PTC (Fig. 4C ; Supplemental Fig. S7B ). Intron retention thus results in globalscale reductions in cytoplasmic transcript levels through additive contributions from both nuclear restriction and NMD. IR down-regulates nonphysiologically relevant transcripts To investigate the potential physiological roles of IR during cell differentiation, we analyzed alternative retained introns using RNA-seq data generated across a time series of differentiation of cortical glutamatergic neurons from murine embryonic stem (ES) cells (Hubbard et al. 2013) . Strikingly, the vast majority (88.7%) of detected differentially retained introns between ES and mature neurons display a progressive increase in retention during differentiation (Fig. 5A ). Consistent with this observation and a global regulatory role for IR in the suppression of gene expression, transcripts with increased IR in mature neurons are, on average, expressed at significantly lower steady-state levels than are transcripts with increased IR in ES cells (Fig. 5B ). Moreover, among the total set of genes that display progressively decreased steady-state levels as neuronal differentiation proceeds, overall PIR levels progressively increase (Fig. 5C ). As a group, genes that contain introns with higher retention in differentiated neurons compared to ES cells are significantly enriched in multiple GO terms, including terms related to the cell cycle (Fig. 5D ). Examination of individual genes that follow the same profile of IR regulation revealed examples that possess effector functions relevant to non-neural tissues, pluripotency, and DNA replication and repair (see below). Conversely, genes with introns whose retention is lower in differentiated neurons compared to ES cells are significantly enriched in GO terms that are relevant to neuronal biology, specifically, ''Neurotransmitter transport'' and ''Synapse'' (Fig. 5E ). Taken together, these observations suggest that increased IR during neuronal differentiation primarily functions to down-regulate transcripts from genes, the expression of which is either not required or less required for the biology of mature neurons compared to ES or neural progenitor cells. It is also possible that IR down-regulates specific genes that, if otherwise expressed, could interfere with the specification of glutamatergic neuronal cell identity. To further investigate and confirm these possibilities, we used RT-PCR assays to validate individual events detected by RNA-seq that display concomitant increases in PIR and decreases in expression during neuronal differentiation. Of 11 tested IR events, all were confirmed to have increased levels of retention and decreased levels of processed mRNA expression (Fig. 5E ; Supplemental Fig. S8 ). Among the validated examples are genes that function in meiosis in germ cells (Sycp3), DNA replication and repair (Mutyh, Pole), synthesis of organic acids concentrated in bile (Hsd3b7, Csad), smooth muscle and spleen biology (Fhod1), glomerulus integrity (Wtip), serotonergic synapses (Cc2d1b), astrocyte differentiation (Arhgap17), and the cytoskeleton organization and proliferation of neural progenitor cells (Flna). An additional example is an IR event in Ssrp1, a component of the ''Facilitates Chromatin Transcription'' (FACT) chromatin remodeling complex, that functions in transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Consistent with our observation that increased IR reduces Ssrp1 mRNA expression during neuronal differentiation, it has been previously reported that FACT is specifically up-regulated in proliferating cells relative to differentiated cells (Garcia et al. 2011) . Our results thus reveal a mechanism by which FACT is down-regulated during differentiation. To investigate whether IR is also involved in the down-regulation of transcripts that may be less physiologically relevant in other biological contexts, we next examined global relationships between IR and the expression levels of genes with varying degrees of functional specificity relevant to neural, muscle and ES cells. Genes were binned according to whether they are (1) down-regulated, (2) equally expressed, or (3) up-regulated in a specified group of tissue samples relative to the rest of the samples, and the degree of enrichment of IR and specific GO terms was analyzed within each bin. As expected (Miki et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2004) , GO terms reflecting cell/tissuespecific functions are increasingly enriched among the subsets of genes with increased cell/tissue-specific expression (Supplemental Table S3 ). Moreover, PIR levels are significantly lower in transcripts from these up-regulated, GO-enriched genes, and they are significantly higher in transcripts from genes with lower levels of cell/tissue-specific expression and GO enrichment (P < 0.001, one-sided Mann-Whitney U tests) (Fig. 5F ). Extending the results shown in Figure 5A-E , these observations indicate that IR acts widely to reduce levels of transcripts from genes with functions that are not relevant or less relevant to the cell or tissue type in which IR is detected. Finally, to assess whether this ''transcriptome tuning'' property of IR is linked to its ability to trigger NMD, we asked whether genes with increased transcript levels in Smg1 gt/gt versus wild-type MEFs (see Fig. 4 ) are more often linked to annotations associated with neural or stem cell functions (i.e., less relevant or potentially detrimental to MEF biology) compared to fibroblast-associated functions. Remarkably, reduced NMD activity in the Smg1 gt/gt MEFs indeed results in significant increases in transcript levels for genes associated with neural and ESC biology compared to fibroblast biology (P < 0.05, one-sided Mann-Whitney U tests after Bonferroni correction) (Fig. 5G ). Collectively, these results indicate that IR-mediated down-regulation of transcripts acts widely to functionally tune cell type-specific gene expression profiles. Mechanism of intron retention To investigate mechanisms underlying IR-mediated gene regulation, we considered contributions both from cis-and trans-acting factors. Most RNA processing occurs cotranscriptionally, and there is increasing evidence for extensive cross-talk between splicing, transcription, and chromatin regulation (Braunschweig et al. 2013; Kornblihtt et al. 2013) . Accordingly, because retained introns are B ) Distributions of expression difference between Smg1 gt/gt and wild-type MEFs for transcripts harboring introns predicted to introduce a PTC that can trigger NMD upon retention (top), and for transcripts harboring introns that are predicted not to introduce a PTC (bottom).

For example, it has been demonstrated that disruption of splicing in nascent RNA leads to proximal, intragenic pausing of RNA Pol II (Fong and Zhou 2001; Alexander et al. 2010; Chathoth et al. 2014) (see below). To investigate these possibilities, we analyzed ENCODE ChIP-seq data for POLR2A, the largest subunit of RNA Pol II, 128 additional transcription and chromatin components from the human K562 hematopoietic cell line, and 40 additional components from the mouse CH12 B lymphoma cell line (The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012), for which we measured IR levels using matching RNA-seq data. This analysis revealed that RNA Pol II, specific chromatin modifications (e.g., H3K27ac), and chromatin regulators (e.g., CHD2) are significantly enriched over retained compared to constitutive introns (Fig. 6A ; Supplemental Fig. S9A ). Moreover, enrichment of these and other specific transcription and chromatin components over retained introns is largely distinct from patterns of enrichment detected over exons. For example, H3K36me3 is significantly enriched over exons (Schwartz et al. 2009; Spies et al. 2009; Tilgner et al. 2009 ), but it is not enriched over retained introns when steady-state expression levels of the corresponding transcripts are controlled for (Fig. 6A ; Supplemental Fig. S9A ). These results thus reveal that, at the genomic level, retained introns are associated with specific chromatin and transcription components. Of all the factors analyzed, Pol II hyperphosphorylated on its C-terminal domain (CTD) at Ser2 (Pol II-Ser2p), the form of Pol II associated with transcription elongation, displays the strongest enrichment over retained introns compared to constitutive introns (Fig. 6B ). This enrichment pattern is observed irrespective of the location of retained introns in transcripts, although occupancy of Pol II is highest near transcription start and termination sites (Supplemental Fig. S9A ). Importantly, we further observe a strong positive correlation between the level of Pol II-Ser2p enrichment over retained introns and the level of IR (Fig. 6B ; Supplemental Fig. S9B ). These results thus indicate that retained introns are sites of significant accumulation of the elongating form of RNA Pol II, and the levels of this accumulation appear to be tightly coupled with IR levels. To further explore the relationship between IR and Pol II elongation, we asked whether drug-induced inhibition of elongation results in increased IR. Previously, which codes for SmB/B9, relative to cells transfected with a control, nontargeting siRNA (Saltzman et al. 2011) . (Dashed lines) Medians of retained (PIR $ 10) and constitutive (PIR < 2) introns in control treated cells; (asterisks) P < 0.001 between these groups (one-sided Mann-Whitney U test). (E) RNA Pol II occupancy over introns (in untreated HeLa cells) that become more retained (PIR difference > 15, red) or that do not change (PIR difference between À2 and +2, gray) after SNRPB knockdown. Because RNA Pol II occupancy is dependent on absolute PIR, groups of introns with matching PIR distributions in control treated cells and >2 kb away from the transcription start site are shown. (Asterisks) P < 0.001 for difference in median Pol II-Ser2p occupancy (see Methods for test details). (F) Expression change between SNRPB and control knockdown for genes containing introns that become more retained (PIR difference > 15, red) or that do not change (PIR difference between À2 and +2, gray). (Asterisks) P < 0.001 between these groups (one-sided Mann-Whitney U test). we showed that treatment of cells with the elongation inhibitor 5,6dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), which inhibits the kinase activity of the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb), leads to cassette exon splicing changes and increased occupancy of Pol II at specific sites adjacent to the affected exons (Ip et al. 2011) , in addition to its known role in causing increased accumulation of Pol II at transcription start sites (Marshall et al. 1996) . Following mock-or DRB-treatment of CGR8 ES cells, we used RT-PCR assays to analyze PIR of introns that are highly retained in differentiated mouse cells relative to mouse ES cells. We observed that 13 of 18 analyzed introns showed detectable increases in retention, with four increasing by PIR $ 10, whereas only two showed decreases and the remaining three either no detectable change, or else a band corresponding to the size of the intron-retained isoform could not be detected (P » 0.01, one-sided Mann-Whitney U test for PIR difference) (Fig. 6C ; Supplemental Fig. S10 ). Collectively, these results provide evidence that localized Pol II pausing over retained introns in genes is coupled to increased IR levels. Finally, we hypothesized that if Pol II accumulation at genomic locations coinciding with retained introns is due, at least in part, to the inefficient recruitment of splicing factors (see Discussion), further reducing the levels of core spliceosome components would preferentially increase PIR levels of introns that are already associated with increased Pol II occupancy. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed poly(A) + RNA-seq data (Saltzman et al. 2011 ) generated from HeLa cells following knockdown of spliceosomal snRNP components. As expected, we observed a general increase in PIR for retained versus constitutive introns (Fig. 6D ). Importantly, introns that display the largest increases in PIR upon snRNP depletion are associated with significantly higher levels of Pol II occupancy than are introns that have comparable PIR levels in untreated cells but show no increase in retention upon snRNP depletion (Fig. 6E ). Furthermore, the levels of transcripts containing introns that show increased retention upon snRNP depletion are significantly reduced compared to the levels of transcripts with introns that do not show an increased PIR (Fig. 6F ). Collectively, although we cannot exclude possible indirect effects of snRNP depletion contributing to increases in IR, these observations further support the conclusion that IR controls mammalian gene expression via a global, bidirectional cross-talk mechanism, in which low levels of transcription lead to impaired recruitment of core splicing factors, which in turn results in localized pausing of RNA Pol II, further intron retention, and ultimately transcript turnover (Fig. 7 ). Discussion In this study, we show that IR is a widespread regulatory mechanism that contributes to the functional tuning of mammalian transcriptomes. Consistent with emerging evidence for IR controlling cell type-specific and developmentally regulated gene expression (Yap et al. 2012; Wong et al. 2013) , we observe that IR globally impacts gene expression in mammalian cells and tissues by negatively regulating cytoplasmic transcript levels. Although IR-mediated nuclear restriction is important, the majority of IRdependent regulation appears to operate through NMD (Fig. 4B, C ). Strikingly, IR is detected at higher levels in transcripts expressed at relatively low levels and annotated with gene functions that are not relevant or less relevant to the cell type or developmental stage in which the transcripts are detected. As we have shown from analyzing IR during neuronal differentiation, this tuning function acts to reduce the expression of genes that are more required for the biology of ES and progenitor cells than the biology of mature neurons. Similarly, this function of IR may act widely to suppress the expression of spurious transcripts that arise as a consequence of the inability of the cell to fully shut off inappropriate transcription. Our results provide a model in which the functional tuning of gene expression is achieved through a global ''checkpoint'' mechanism by which IR regulates transcript levels via cross-talk with RNA Pol II. We show that IR is closely linked to the stalling of RNA Pol II, since increased occupancy of Pol II over retained introns in genomic DNA correlates strongly with increased IR levels (Fig. 6B ; Supplemental Fig. S9B ). IR is also highly correlated with specific sequence features including reduced intron length, elevated C/G content, intron position within the transcript, and splice site strength. The increased pausing of Pol II over retained introns may in part be due to the increased C/G content of these sequences, as increased C/G content of genes has recently been shown to negatively correlate with Pol II elongation rate (Veloso et al. 2014) . Moreover, it is also possible that intron retention is related to differences in the relative G/C content of intron versus flanking intron sequences, which has been shown to impact whether splicing proceeds via an intron or exon definition-type mechanism (Amit et al. 2012) . Given previous extensive evidence of splicing factor recruitment to sites of active transcription through coupling mechanisms that involve chromatin and transcription factors (Braunschweig et al. 2013; Kornblihtt et al. 2013) , including splicing activators and the Pol II carboxyl-terminal domain (David and Manley 2011) , it is possible that reduced transcriptional levels, for example arising from low frequency spurious promoter activation, result in insufficient recruitment of splicing factors to promote efficient intron removal in nascent RNA. Since retained introns generally have weaker splice sites compared to constitutive introns (this study; Sakabe and de Souza 2007) , they are particularly sensitive to reduced splicing factor concentrations (Fig. 6 ; Wong et al. 2013) . Moreover, because Pol II elongation in turn depends on productive splicing (Fong and Zhou 2001; Alexander et al. 2010; Chathoth et al. 2014) , retained introns likely become sites of increased pausing of Pol II because of their inefficient splicing. As also supported by the results of DRB treatment, which led to increased retention of most analyzed introns (Fig. 6C ), reduced elongation of Pol II over retained introns appears to be mechanistically linked to increased intron retention levels. The kinetic delay in Pol II elongation could lead to increased binding of repressive splicing factors, such as the hnRNP splicing regulator PTBP1 (Yap et al. 2012) , and as a consequence further contribute to establishing IR in otherwise processed and polyadenylated RNA. These nuclear events ultimately culminate in the turnover of retained intron-containing poly(A) + RNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm and contribute to the down-regulation of gene expression. Methods Data sets This study used poly(A) + RNA-seq data generated as part of the Illumina Human BodyMap 2.0 Project and as described in Brawand et al. (2011) and Barbosa-Morais et al. (2012) , as well as multiple other data sets described in the literature (Supplemental Table S1 ). ENCODE ChIP-seq data were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra; The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012). GEO accessions of all analyzed ChIPseq data sets are provided in Supplemental Table S4 . Sequence annotation Full genomic sequences for the 11 species analyzed in this study were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser database (Dreszer et al. 2012 ) (assemblies listed in Supplemental Table S5 ). Full transcriptomic sequences for all species were downloaded from Ensembl (Flicek et al. 2013 ) (transcriptome versions listed in Supplemental Table S5 ). For each gene, the representative transcript was selected for gene expression (GE) analysis as in Barbosa-Morais et al. (2012) . Intron annotations (including genomic coordinates) for intron retention (IR) analysis were derived from tables downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser database. The selected tables for each species are listed in Supplemental Table S5 . Orthology definition The comparison of GE levels between species relied on orthology relationships provided by Ensembl. The analysis was restricted to 1:1 orthology relationships between any given pair of species. The orthology relationships between introns for cross-species comparative IR analyses were obtained by converting the genomic coordinates between genomes using the liftOver tool from Galaxy (Giardine et al. 2005; Blankenberg et al. 2010; Goecks et al. 2010) and selecting 1:1 overlaps. Gene expression estimation Gene expression levels were determined using the cRPKM metric, i.e., reads per thousand unique-mappable positions of target transcript sequence per million of mapped reads, as described in Labbe et al. (2012) . Percent intron retention (PIR) estimation We considered every intron a potential retained intron. Each putative IR event was delineated by the adjacent 59 and 39 exons (E1 and E2, respectively) and the intron itself (I). For each event, we define two retention junctions, E1I (connecting exon E1 and the intron) and IE2 (connecting the intron and exon E2), and one constitutive (i.e., no retention) junction, E1E2 (connecting exons E1 and E2). For each species and each read length, k, we assembled all unique retention and constitutive junction sequences for subsequent poly(A) + RNA-seq alignments. These junction sequences were constructed such that there is a minimum overlap of 8 nt between the reads and each of the exons or introns involved (i.e., not exceeding 2k À 16 in length) and such that only sequences from those two exons/intron are aligned (i.e., the length of the alignment is reduced if any of the exons or the intron are less than k À 8). For each junction, we then determined the effective number of uniquely mappable positions. We extracted the L À k + 1 (L being the junction length) k-mers from each junction sequence and then aligned the full set of k-mers against the respective genome plus all exon-exon junctions, using Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009 ) and allowing for a maximum of two mismatches. k-mers with a single alignment (thus potential junction reads) were then aligned back to the full, nonredundant set of junction sequences. The number of such k-mers with one unique alignment mapping to a junction was counted. This corresponds to the junction's effective number of uniquely mappable positions for k-mer poly(A) + RNA-seq reads. For each sample, the corresponding poly(A) + RNA-seq data were aligned against the respective genome plus all exon-exon junctions, using Bowtie and allowing for a maximum of two mismatches. Reads with a single mapping were then aligned to the full nonredundant set of junction sequences and, for each junction, the number of reads with one unique alignment mapping to it were counted. For each junction, the read count was normalized for mappability by multiplying it by the ratio between the maximum number of mappable positions (i.e., k À 15) and its effective number of uniquely mappable positions (as defined above). To control for the possibility of reads mapping to exon-intron junctions reflecting alternative 59 and/or 39 splice sites and not bona fide IR events, we also aligned the poly(A) + RNA-seq data against intron body sequences. To optimize processing time and disk space usage, for each intron we selected its middle 200 nt (or the full intron, if shorter) as the sample window. Selecting midpoint intronic sequences for quantification purposes further has the advantage of avoiding situations where unannotated alternative 59 and 39 splice sites may affect the accuracy of intron level measurements. For each intronic window, we determined the effective number of uniquely mappable positions. We extracted the L À k + 1 (L being the intronic window length) k-mers from each intronic window and then aligned the full set of k-mers against the respective genome, using Bowtie and allowing for a maximum of two mismatches. k-mers with a single alignment (thus potential intronic reads) were then aligned back to the full, nonredundant set of intron sample sequences. The number of such k-mers with one unique alignment mapping to an intron was counted. This corresponds to the intron sample sequence's effective number of uniquely mappable positions for k-mer poly(A) + RNA-seq reads. For each sample, the corresponding poly(A) + RNA-seq data were aligned against the respective genome, using Bowtie and allowing for a maximum of two mismatches. Reads with a single mapping were then aligned to the full nonredundant set of intron sample sequences and, for each sequence, the number of reads with one unique alignment mapping to it were counted. For each intronic sequence, the read count was normalized for mappability and made directly comparable with the corresponding junction read counts (see coverage and balance motivations below) by multiplying it by the ratio between the junctions' maximum number of mappable positions (i.e., kÀ15) and the intronic sequence's effective number of uniquely mappable positions (as defined above). The PIR value for each intron was defined as follows: PIR = 100 3 average(#E1I, #IE2)/(#E1E2 + average(#E1I, #IE2)), where #E1I, #IE2 and #E1E2 are the normalized read counts for the associated junctions. PIR values were then filtered according to the following empirical criteria: • PIRmin* # 95; • median(#EI1, #IE2, #I) + #E1E2 > 10; • P-value(binomial{M = min(#E1I, #IE2, #I), N = min(#E1I, #IE2, #I) + max(#E1I, #IE2, #I), P = 1/3.5, alternative = lower }) $ 0.05; • The first and last bp of the intron have no overlap with annotated exons either in the same or a different gene annotated in UCSC knownGene. #I is the normalized read count for the associated intron sample sequence. PIRmin* is the minimum PIR value across all the samples in which the intron fulfills the second and third criteria. Binomial is an exact binomial test. In this case, M is the number of successes, N is the number of trials, P is the hypothesized probability of success, and alternative indicates the alternative hypothesis. In our case, the alternative is a proportion of successes lower than the null probability. We actually keep the events for which there is not enough evidence that the ratio between M and N is lower than P. The goal of the first criterion was to exclude the possibility of measuring constitutive retention of a false intron due to misannotation issues. The goal of the second criterion (coverage) was to ensure sufficient read evidence for IR detection and enough coverage for sufficient precision and resolution in the estimation of PIR levels. The goal of the third criterion (balance) was to exclude events in which there is a high imbalance in read counts among the two exon-intron junctions and the intron body sequence. Such imbalances can arise from neighboring alternative 59 and/or 39 splice sites or overlapping genes, confound PIR estimates, and lead to the false detection of IR. The goal of the last criterion was to avoid falsely interpreting exonic reads from an alternative transcript isoform or another gene as junction reads supporting IR. The resulting PIR calls were robust with respect to sequencing depth, which was tested by randomly sampling between 1.25% and 80% of the reads in the original sample and recalculating PIR as described above (data not shown). Mouse and human introns considered analyzed in this study are provided in Supplemental Tables S6, S7 . PIR values for each intron in each tissue/cell type/treatment are provided in Supplemental Tables S8-S13 . The thresholds assigned for PIR differed between analyses, as indicated in the main text. Logistic model of IR in pooled human neural samples (''IR code'') Aligned reads from six human neural samples (see Supplemental Table S14 ) were pooled, and PIR was calculated for the pool as described above. Then, of the 123.042 introns with PIR values that passed the quality control criteria (see above), we labeled all introns with PIRs # 2 ''constitutive'' (71,188 introns) and all introns with PIRs $ 10 ''retained'' (17,185 introns) . We learned a logistic regression model using a total of 136 features that describe length, sequence composition and dinucleotide frequency of introns and flanking exons, gene architecture, and splice site strength (Supplemental Table S2 ). Learning was done using fivefold cross-validation. The area under the ROC curve of the predictions of unseen data was AUC = 0.79 (P < 1 3 10 À300 , n = 88,373), and the KS statistic was 0.433 (P < 1 3 10 À300 ). Moreover, when only predicting the most reliable introns (sorted based on PIR; top half of retained and bottom half of constitutive introns), the AUC increased to 0.85 and the KS statistic to 0.483. For Figure 1D , we elected to display only features that are significant in a reduced model with 19 lowly correlated features but which retains an AUC of 0.76 (Supplemental Table S2 ). Estimation of the total number of retained introns To estimate the total number of retained introns at a given PIR threshold, t, the order of all n samples was randomized, and the total number of introns with PIR $ t in any of the first 1, 2,..., n samples was determined. This procedure was iterated 1000 times, and the mean of each number of samples was calculated. A function with two exponential terms, f(x) = p 1 (1 À e Àp2 x ) + p 3 (1 À e Àp4 x ), was fitted to these means. Fitting using two terms afforded a substantial improvement over fitting using a single exponential term. The limit of the fitted function, given by p 1 + p 3 , was used as the estimation of the total fraction of introns that are potentially retained at a given PIR threshold in one or more cell and tissue type. Estimation of the total fraction of genes with retained introns was performed in a similar manner, in this case by determining the total fraction of genes in which any intron is retained at a given PIR threshold. Location of IR and intron PTC status The location of introns within the 59-UTR, CDS, 39-UTR, or within a noncoding transcript, was inferred from the CDS coordinate information in annotation tables downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser. Introns located precisely between two regions were disregarded. We used custom Perl scripts to annotate whether or not CDS introns introduce a PTC upon retention, essentially as described for cassette alternative exons in Saltzman et al. (2008) . For the analysis of 59-39 bias, we converted the relative intron ranks (intron rank within the transcript divided by number of introns in the transcript) to 10 equal-sized bins. Conservation of IR in vertebrates The fraction of retained introns in species S (PIR $ 10) that are also retained in another species P, was determined considering all introns where a PIR could be calculated in both species. For each of the major organs, IR was compared in all pairwise combinations of species (S, P). Note that the fraction in S also retained in P need not be the same as the fraction in P also retained in S. In Figure 3A , these fractions were plotted against the evolutionary distance. Significance of PIR differences between each organ and the average of all other organs was determined as follows: For each organ, a table was created in which the rows corresponded to all pairwise species comparisons, and columns contained the fraction of retained introns in the given organ and the average in all other organs; paired two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed on these tables, and derived P-values were Bonferroni-corrected. Clustering of organ samples from different species based on PIR values was performed using Euclidean distance (complete linkage). Introns that have a minimum differential PIR of 10 in at least three species were clustered (n = 4835). For plotting purposes only, missing values were imputed using an R implementation of the DINEOF procedure (Beckers and Rixen 2003) (http://menugget. blogspot.ca/2012/10/dineof-data-interpolating-empirical.html). Rows (introns) were then clustered by column Euclidean distance using Ward's linkage, and both rows and columns were reordered according to mean PIR within the constraints of the dendrograms. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out with the ''princomp'' function in R (R Core Team 2014), following standardization without scaling (''stdize'' function, CRAN package ''pls''), using the same introns as for clustering, replacing missing values with imputed ones. Assignment of retained intron types Three types of introns were defined based on their evolutionary origin. Type A are ancestral introns flanked by constitutive exons; Type B arose by ''intronization'' of ancestral exonic sequence (Irimia et al. 2008) ; and Type C are located adjacent to one or more alternative exons that may or may not be conserved between species. Retained introns were classified as Type A if the intron in question was conserved between the human and mouse genomes (but not necessarily retained in both species), with 9-bp precision after coordinate conversion using the UCSC liftOver tool (parameter -inMatch=0.10). Classification as Type A also required that there were no overlapping RefSeq-annotated exons from the same gene overlapping the intron and that no introns overlapped the exons. To identify Type B retained introns in human and mouse, we mapped the genomic coordinates for each human and mouse intron (''probed introns'') to the following species' genome assemblies using the liftOver tool (parameters: -minMatch=0.10 -multiple -minChainT=200 -minChainQ=200): Anolis carolinensis (anoCar2), Bos taurus (bosTau6), Canis familiaris (canFam3, for human, and canFam2, for mouse), Gallus gallus (galGal3), Loxodonta africana (loxAfr3), Monodelphis domestica (monDom5), Ornithorhynchus anatinus (ornAna1), Rattus norvegicus (rn5), Sus scrofa (susScr2), plus human (hg19, for mouse), and mouse (mm9, for human). Next, we downloaded Gene Transfer Format annotations for these species from Ensembl (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org), and intersected the lifted-over coordinates of each probed intron with the corresponding annotated exonic and intronic coordinates using BEDTools ''intersect'' (Quinlan and Hall 2010) . We then asked which probed introns fully overlapped with annotated exons but not with introns in at least two other species. For this, we required that (1) the length of the intron-exon intersect was equal to the length of the lifted-over intron, and (2) that the length of the lifted-over intron was at least half of the probed intron. Finally, in the case of probed introns with partial intersections with both annotated exons and introns in other species, we discarded those for which there were more species with longer overlap to introns compared to exons than vice versa. Using this approach, we defined 327 and 141 Type B introns in human and mouse, respectively. Type C introns in human and mouse were defined as follows: At least one of the flanking exons was required to overlap entirely with both a RefSeq-annotated intron in the same orientation in the same species and similarly to an intron lifted-over from the other species (mouse/human) with 9-bp precision. Type annotations for each intron are provided in Supplemental Tables S6 and S7 . Analysis of splice-site strength MaxEntScan (Yeo and Burge 2004) was used to calculate maximum entropy scores for 9-bp 59 splice sites and 20-bp 39 splice sites. Correlation between IR and gene expression Spearman rank correlations of PIR and expression (cRPKM) of the corresponding gene (see above) were calculated for all introns in which there were at least two samples in which both PIR and expression could be calculated, and where no more than one sample had a PIR = 0. The latter was required in order to exclude introns in which most of the observed variance in expression was due to other mechanisms of gene regulation. We also investigated the association between PIR and gene expression using groups of genes with increasing expression levels. For each sample in human (52 in total) and in mouse (65 in total), we divided genes into deciles according to their cRPKM value in that specific sample and calculated the fraction of retained introns (defined as PIR $ 10, PIR $ 20, or PIR $ 50) in each decile. Lower deciles (1-4) were merged to increase the number of data points due to their inherently lower read coverage. Genes with cRPKM < 2 across all samples were discarded. Analysis of IR during in vitro neuronal differentiation PIR and gene expression cRPKM were calculated as described above. For the introns with enough read coverage and balance for the six analyzed time points, we asked which had an absolute PIR difference of more than 15 between ES cells (À8 d) and fully mature neurons (28 d). We identified 825 introns with a dPIR > 15 and 105 with a dPIR < À15. A heatmap of Z-scores of PIRs for these introns was plotted using the heatmap.2 function in R. GO (Ashburner et al. 2000) and KEGG Pathway (Kanehisa et al. 2004 ) enrichment analysis for the genes containing the two groups of introns was performed in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (Huang da et al. 2009) (using raw P-value < 0.005 for at least one term within the cluster as cutoff). Analysis of functional annotations associated with IR in ES, muscular, neural, and fibroblast cells Median PIR in neural, muscle, and ES cells, and in complementary sets of ''other'' cell/tissue types, was calculated for selections of samples in which assignment to ''biological type'' was unambiguous (i.e., samples such as precursor cells and cell lines were excluded) (see Supplemental Table S14 ). Only events in which PIR values had been determined in at least two samples of the respective tissue group and in at least five ''other'' samples were considered. Analysis of differential gene expression relied on the B-statistic, i.e., the empirical Bayes log-odds of differential expression (Smyth 2004) . Genes were considered to be differentially expressed between the sample group of interest (neural/muscle/ES cells) and the ''other'' cell/tissue types if B > log 2 (19), corresponding to 95% odds of differential expression. Broad functional categories of genes were constructed as follows: The full table of GO categories, downloaded on September 15, 2013, was searched with the following search terms: • Neural categories: ''brain'' OR ''retina'' OR ''synapse'' AND NOT ''immuno'' • Muscle categories: ''muscle'' OR ''myo'' OR ''sarco'' OR ''contractile'' • Stem cell categories: ''stem cell'' • Fibroblast-related categories: ''fibroblast'' Genes were then labeled with the broad categories if they were annotated with any of the found GO categories. Lists of all considered categories and categories found associated with genes in human and mouse are provided in Supplemental Table S3 . Selection of candidate IR events for RT-PCR validation Mouse IR events that, by RNA-seq analysis, displayed differential retention in mouse and human neural, muscle, or ES cells/tissues, or had a flat retention profile in both species, were selected for validation by RT-PCR. Events selected for analysis also had a PIR of 0 or 100 in less than half of the samples assayed. Finally, the selected events were also those predicted to be expressed in at least 10 analyzed RNA samples, had intron and flanking exon lengths amenable to RT-PCR, and that did not overlap other genes. Analysis of ChIP-seq data Reads were converted to FASTQ format, mapped to the human (hg19) or mouse (mm9) genomes using Bowtie with settings-best -n 2 -k 1, and duplicate reads were removed. Reads falling into an arbitrary genomic region of 2 Mb were used to estimate ChIP fragment length by determining the distance at which the cross-corre-lation of the numbers of reads mapping to each bp on the + and À strands was maximal. All reads were then extended to that fragment length or 120 bp, whichever was higher. Pileups-the number of fragments overlapping each genomic bp-were calculated, and were normalized by million mappable reads in the ChIP-seq library. Normalized pileups from replicate experiments were then averaged, and matched input samples were subtracted, creating input-subtracted FPM (fragments per million reads). Input subtraction was deemed necessary because without it, ChIP-seq profiles routinely displayed enrichment or depletion on average across introns, exons, or transcription start sites. For alignment plots, sets of introns with their flanking exons were defined as outlined in the figures, and input-subtracted (unless indicated otherwise), normalized FPM were averaged per bp such that the grouped introns were superimposed by their splice donor or acceptor sites (left and right half of plots, respectively). Values for each aligned intronic (white plot area) or exonic (gray plot area) bp were averaged at any one position. These within-group averages were plotted directly without smoothing. Statistical tests All statistical analyses were performed in R (R Core Team 2014), a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, making use of packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/, tools for the analysis of high-throughput genomic data). Where applicable and not indicated otherwise, P-values were corrected for multiple testing with the Bonferroni method. To test the significance of Pol II-Ser2p ChIP-seq signal differences between introns with unchanged or increased PIR after knockdown of SNRPB in HeLa cells, groups of introns were first matched for comparable PIR in control-treated cells, giving rise to 1442 pairs of introns. Median ChIP signals were then calculated from normalized, control-subtracted ChIP signals (see above) in both introns of each pair. To avoid confounding possible factors due to different ChIP signals near the ends versus in the interior of introns, the whole intron was considered for the shorter intron, but for the longer intron only equal-sized regions from the 59 and 39 end that together were of the same length as the shorter intron were considered. The resulting median value pairs were subjected to a paired, one-sided Mann-Whitney U test. Cell culture For in vitro differentiation of ES cells into neurons, CGR8 mouse ES cells were maintained at subconfluent conditions on gelatincoated plates and were differentiated into neurons as previously described (Hubbard et al. 2013) . RNA was extracted at different time points during the differentiation protocol using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For treatment with DRB, CGR8 mouse ES cells were seeded at 50% confluence and treated for 24 h with 10 or 25 mg/mL DRB or DMSO as a control. RT-PCR validation RT-PCR assays were performed essentially as previously described (Calarco et al. 2007) . In each reaction, 3-10 ng total RNA (40 ng for validation of events during neuronal differentiation) or 0.3-1 ng poly(A) + RNA was used as input, and cDNA synthesis and amplification were performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. For assays in DRB-treated CGR8 cells, total RNA was purified and DNase treated using Qiagen's RNeasy kit, and 40 ng were used for cDNA synthesis and amplified by PCR. For short introns (<400 bp), the assay used two primers, one in each flanking exon. For long introns (>2 kb), the assay was designed with one reverse primer in the flanking downstream exon and two mutually exclusive forward primers: one in the flanking upstream exon, which could only amplify a spliced product in the given amplification time, and one in the intron itself, which could only amplify a retained product. The number of amplification cycles varied from 29 to 37, depending on the transcript and the sample analyzed; 24 cycles were used for Gapdh. Reaction products were resolved using 1.5%-3% TAE-agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and imaged using the Gel Doc XR System (Bio-Rad). ImageJ software was used to measure the intensity of bands representing the retained and spliced isoforms, and these values were normalized by product size. PIR levels of retained introns were then calculated as the amount of retained isoform divided by the sum of spliced and retained isoforms. Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3.

Inaccurate cell/tissue-specific transcription leads to low levels of expression and reduced recruitment of splicing factors to nascent transcripts. Weak splice sites and/or other cis features associated with retained introns leads to their retention. Binding of basal splicing components such as U1 snRNP (green circle) to the 59 splice site of constitutive introns promotes Pol II elongation (Fong and Zhou 2001; Alexander et al. 2010), whereas the absence of recruitment of such factors promotes IR and reduces RNA Pol II elongation. Reduced Pol II elongation may further promote and commit introns to retention by favoring binding of splicing repressive factors (red ovals). www.genome.org Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on April 21, 2025 .

Introduction A key question is how sensory systems achieve parallel processing within a neuronal network transmitting different units of information (Christensen et al., 1998; Kayser et al., 2012; Gire et al., 2013b; Panzeri et al., 2014) . Early in the olfactory system, spikes of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells appear to convey sharply different units of information (Christensen et al., 1998; Cury and Uchida, 2010; Blumhagen et al., 2011; Doucette et al., 2011; Shusterman et al., 2011; Gschwend et al., 2012; Gire et al., 2013a) ; spikes precisely locked to the rhythmic sniff cycle are postulated to convey information on odor identity ("what is the odor?"; Davison and Katz, 2007; Cury and Uchida, 2010; Shusterman et al., 2011; Gschwend et al., 2012; Gire et al., 2013a) , and changes in spike rate convey information on the differential treatment of the rewarded odor ("is the odor rewarded?"; Doucette et al., 2011; Gire et al., 2013a) . However, it is unclear whether these and other features of the odor stimulus are conveyed in parallel by the network of M/T neurons within the olfactory bulb (OB), the first central signal processing area in the olfactory system. Based on the understanding that the aggregate neural activity that underlies the local field potential (LFP) can be used for segmentation of neuronal activity to extract specific items of information (Ito et al., 2011; Buzsa ´ki and Watson, 2012) , we formulate the hypothesis that the LFP provides the temporal reference frame needed to extract information from the spike train of M/T neurons that can be used to differentiate between odors regardless of the associated outcome. To test this hypothesis, we record LFP and M/T cell spiking in go-no go experiments where the mouse learned to respond to one odor (rewarded) and not to an unrewarded odor. In this go-no go experiment, the odors do not elicit a divergent spike rate response at the beginning of the session, but the spike responses become divergent as the mouse learns to differentiate the odors (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Doucette et al., 2011) . Thus spike rate conveys information on odor reward. We postulate that spike-field coherence provides information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome. Importantly in the insect olfactory system, when an odor is presented, it induces transient ϒ frequency oscillation in the neural population of the antennal lobe (equivalent to the mammalian OB), and silencing ϒ oscillation interferes with discrimination of closely related odorants (Stopfer et al., 1997; Laurent, 2002; Perez-Orive et al., 2002; Christensen et al., 2003) . In mammals, ϒ LFP responses in the OB are thought to carry information on odor identity (Nusser et al., 2001; Beshel et al., 2007; Lepousez and Lledo, 2013; Kay, 2014) . In addition, in the frequency, the LFP partially follows sniffing (Grosmaitre et al., 2007; Rosero and Aylwin, 2011; Gschwend et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2012) , and sniffing has been postulated to provide a temporal basis to extract odor identity (Cury and Uchida, 2010; Shusterman et al., 2011; Wa-chowiak, 2011; Blauvelt et al., 2013) . Finally, neuronal oscillation related to the LFP has been implicated to underlie extraction of information on odor identity (Laurent, 2002; Brody and Hopfield, 2003) . Together, these studies raise the question of whether the field potential can be used to read out information on properties such as odor identity when M/T cell spike firing is largely involved in conveying information on whether the odor is rewarded (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Doucette et al., 2011) . We find that ϒ LFP coherence with M/T cell spiking provides information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome. Materials and Methods Animals and tetrode implantation. We followed methods used previously for OB microarray implantation (Doucette et al., 2011) with modifications for use of tetrodes (Felsen and Mainen, 2008) . Briefly male 8-to 13-week-old C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Mice were implanted with one ground screw inserted 1 mm posterior from the bregma and 1 mm away from the midline, and four tetrodes were inserted in the OB 4 mm anterior to bregma and 0.5 mm lateral from the midline. Tetrodes were lowered to an average depth between 1.8 and 2.0 mm targeting the ventral M/T cell layer (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008) . Each tetrode consisted of four polyimide-coated nichrome wires (Sandvik; single-wire diameter, 12 m) connected to a 16 channel electrode interface board Neuralynx) . Recording was performed during implantation to ensure optimal placement within the ventral M/T cell layer. For the optogenetic experiments we used OMP-hChR2V mice where the coding sequence for olfactory marking protein (OMP) was replaced with a human codon optimized version of channelrhodopsin-2 (H134R), fused to Venus YFP (Li et al., 2014) . The optotetrodes included one glass tube for the optic fiber and four tetrodes that consisted of four polymide-coated nichrome wires (diameter, 12.5 m; Sandvik) gold plated to an impedance of 0.2-0.4 M⍀. Tetrodes were connected and glass tube was glued through an EIB-16 interface board (Neuralynx). The optotetrodes were implanted targeting the mitral cell layer in the OB determined by M/T cell firing (depth, 1800 -2200 m; Doucette et al., 2011) and sealed to the bone by dental acrylic. Optotetrodes were implanted in nine mice. All animal procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In vivo electrophysiological recordings for light stimulation. We followed the procedures in our previous study (Li et al., 2014) . Briefly, during recording, the mouse was freely moving in a chamber (11.6 ϫ 9.7 ϫ 9.4 cm deep). The signals recorded from the tetrodes were sent to a headstage (LP16CH; Tucker-Davis Technologies) and a 16 channel amplifier (Model 3500, A-M Systems; bandpass, 1-5000 Hz, 2000ϫ gain), and were sampled at 24 kHz by a DT3010 analog-to-digital (A/D) card (Data Translation). Light was delivered via a diode-pumped, solid-state laser (473 nm; Shanghai Laser and Optics Century). The power was measured to be 19.5-21.5 mW for pulses of 5-200 ms. Light stimulation was triggered by the recording program, which sent a signal to a stimulator (Master 8, A.M.P.I.). Temporal parameters were as follows: five light pulses per trial; 10 -200 ms pulse duration. Light pulses were presented for 12 trials with an intertrial interval of 20 s, 60 pulses for each duration. Light activation was not synchronized with sniff. Go-no go and go-go behavioral tasks. We used instrumental conditioning in freely moving mice in the Slotnick olfactometer (Bodyak and Slotnick, 1999; Abraham et al., 2004; Doucette et al., 2011) . Briefly, for go-no go tasks, the water-deprived mice were required to enter the odor port and start licking on the water delivery tube, and obtained water reinforcement after licking this tube for 2 s in trials involving the reinforced odor. When exposed to the unreinforced odor, they quit licking because of the substantial effort required for licking the tube. Presence in the odor port was detected by breaking the light path of a photodiode, and licking was detected by closing a circuit between the water tube and the grounded floor of the cage (Slotnick and Restrepo, 2005) . Figure 1A shows an example of monitoring licking, sniffing, and the tetrode signal during the odor exposure trial. As shown in Figure 1B of Doucette et al. 2011 , there is a minimal difference in sniffing frequency in the first 2 s after the addition of the reinforced versus the unreinforced odor. All mice were first trained to distinguish 10% isoamyl acetate (v/v; reinforced odor, Sϩ) versus mineral oil (unreinforced odor, SϪ). The animal's performance was evaluated in blocks of 20 trials (10 reinforced and 10 unreinforced presented at random), and each session included 6 -10 blocks. Each block's percent correct value represents the percentage of trials in which the odors were correctly discriminated and associated with the appropriate behavioral action. Once the animal learned to discriminate between isoamyl acetate and air in one to three sessions, they were ready for the go-no go novel odor discrimination task. For novel odor discrimination in go-no go experiments, we used odors that we found stimulated ventral M/T cells in previous work (Doucette et al., 2011) . One to three days after the animals performed the "forward" go-no go session, the Sϩ (rewarded) and SϪ (unrewarded) odors were reversed in a "reversed" go-no go session. Finally, in go-go experiments, the animal was required to enter the odor port and start licking, and obtained water reward in 70% of trials if they licked for 2 s during exposure to either of the two odors. The following compounds were used as Sϩ/SϪ odors in the go-no go experiments (or SϪ/Sϩ odors in the reversal) and as one of the two odors in the go-go experiments: phenyl acetate/2-butanone, acetophenone/octaldehyde, heptanoic acid/ethyl propionate and 1-nonanol/2-undecanone. Odor delivery. We performed measurements of odor delivery using a photoionization detector (mini-PID; Aurora Scientific; Doucette et al., 2011) . Odor delivery occurred 0.3 s after turning the odor delivery valve on, and the timing was corrected to zero at the time for odor delivery. Monitoring sniffing. Sniffs and unit activity were simultaneously recorded in 10 mice in go-no go and go-go experiments. As described in previous publications (Doucette et al., 2011; Gire et al., 2013a) , surgical procedures for cannula implantation were based upon the work of Wesson et al. (2008) . Briefly, animals were anesthetized as described above, and lidocaine was injected into the epidermis above the frontal nasal bone as a local anesthetic. An incision was made down the midline, and the skull was cleaned with 3% H 2 O 2 . Next, a hole was drilled 1 mm anterior to the frontal/nasal fissure and 1 mm lateral from the midline using a dental drill. A hollow cannula made from a cut 21 g needle was then lowered into the hole and fixed in place with nail acrylic. Sniffing was detected by recording intranasal pressure through the implanted nasal cannula connected to a pressure sensor (Model 24PCEFA6G(EA), 0 -0.5 psi; Honeywell) via polyethylene tubing. Voltage reporting on pressure transients was amplified 100-fold using a 3000 amplifier from A-M systems, digitized using a DT3010 A/D card from Data Translation in a computer and sampled at 24 kHz. Each sniff was detected as occurring at the point for the transition from exhalation to inhalation. Recording setup. The recording setup is as described previously (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Doucette et al., 2011; Gire et al., 2013a) , with the exception that in this study a screw was used to provide ground at the brain surface to record both LFP and spikes. The output of the four tetrodes was directed to a Tucker-Davis Technologies 1ϫ gain headstage that was in turn connected to an A-M Systems 3600 amplifier. The signal from the four tetrodes was amplified 2000 times before outputting to a Data Translation DT3010 A/D card in a computer. Data were acquired at 24 kHz with custom software written in MATLAB (MathWorks). Sniffing and digitized behavioral events from the Slotnick olfactometer (licks, presence of the mouse in the odor port, and odor on) were also acquired in real time (Fig. 1A ). Offline LFP processing and spike clustering. Data were filtered digitally with a Butterworth filter from 4 to 100 Hz for LFP and 300 to 3000 Hz for spike detection using the MATLAB filtfilt function with zero phase shift (Fig. 1A ). For the LFP, was filtered at 4 -12 Hz and ϒ at 65-95 Hz, and the LFP signals were averaged per block. Custom software written in MATLAB was used to threshold spikes in each channel at three times the standard deviation. Every thresholded spike (24 points at 24 kHz) was imported into a second program where we clustered the waveforms of similar shape by performing wavelet decomposition and superparamagnetic clustering using the method and MATLAB software developed by Quiroga et al. (2004) as described previously (Doucette et al., 2011; Gire et al., 2013a) , modified to process tetrode data. We defined a single unit using the criterion of finding Ͻ3% of the spikes in the refractory period of 2 ms in the interspike interval histogram (usually Ͻ1% of spikes violated the 2 ms refractory period; Fig. 1B-E ). On average, we obtained four multiunits and two single units per experiment (Fig. 1F ). Data from single units and multiunits were used for data analysis. Power spectral density of LFP was estimated in MATLAB using methods of Kay and Lazzara (2010) . The LFPs recorded from the different electrodes in an implant were averaged per session. Spike-field coherence. We estimated coherence to test the relationship between spike firing and LFP (or sniff and LFP). Coherency is a method to estimate at each frequency (f ) the extent of amplitude covariation and matching phase relationship between two signals (Jarvis and Mitra, 2001; Womelsdorf et al., 2006) . In coherency, the Fourier transforms of the two signals (x and y, e.g., spikes and LFP) are used to calculate multitaper estimates for the spectrum [S x (f ) and S y (f )] and the cross-spectrum [S xy (f ); calculated as by Womelsdorf et al. (2006)) ]. Spectra and cross-spectra are averaged over trials before calculating the coherency [C xy (f)]: C xy (f) ϭ S xy (f)/[S x (f) S y (f)] 1/2 . Coherency is a complex number, and the absolute value is termed coherence and has a value of one if the two signals have substantial phase and amplitude covariation relationship, while the coherence is zero if phase relationship and amplitude covariation do not match at a specific frequency (Jarvis and Mitra, 2001; Womelsdorf et al., 2006) . For the assessment of coherence, we used windows of Ϯ500 ms for and Ϯ 250 ms for gamma frequency. These windows were moved over the data in steps of 100 or 50 ms, respectively. For each window, we applied mutitaper analysis of coherence involving the multiplication of data segments with multiple tapers before Fourier transformation to achieve optimal spectral concentration. Tapering effectively concentrates spectral estimates across a specified frequency band and allows estimation of the statistical error of coherence. We used a time-bandwidth product of three and five tapers (and using five and nine yielded a similar result; data not shown). Spike-field coherence was calculated using spectra and cross spectra of the spikes and LFP in and ␥ frequencies, and sniff-field coherency was calculated using the LFP and sniff in the frequency. The spikes were convolved with a normal distribution ( ϭ 4 ms). The estimation of coherence with MATLAB was tested using simulated data. The magnitude of the odor-elicited changes of the coherence was in a similar magnitude to changes in the visual system (Womelsdorf et al., 2006) . Finally, the measure we used of spike-field coherence is biased by relatively large changes in spike rate (Vinck et al., 2012) . However, this is not a Figure 1 . Data acquisition during awake behavior recording. A, Example of data recorded during each trial. Raw data were recorded at 24 kHz. LFP data were obtained by filtering in different frequency ranges. Spike data were obtained by digitally filtering the raw data from 300 to 5000 Hz. Sniff pressure measurement is filtered by Ͼ2 Hz. Recording of lick status was performed digitally, ranging from licking at a value of one and no licking at a value of zero.

Analysis of odor-elicited changes in firing rate, LFP power, and coherence. Analysis for odor-induced changes in the rate of firing of neurons, the power of LFP, and coherence was performed using custom-written MATLAB programs tested previously using simulated data (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Doucette et al., 2011) . Briefly, for each behavioral session, a t test was used to classify a unit as ''divergent'' within a block when the responses to the rewarded odor and the unrewarded odor were statistically different (see Figs. 2 D, E, 4D, 6C, D, 7 B, C ). The calculated t test p values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR; Curran-Everett, 2000) . FDR is a statistical method used previously by our group (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008) that is suitable for testing significant differences in large data sets and does not require independent data (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001, 2005) . Using this method, we calculated a p value for statistical significance (pFDR). This is particularly relevant to awake behaving recording, where a subset of the units fire in a related manner. Differences between behavioral sessions (e.g., forward go-no go vs go-go) in each block in the number of units diverging in odor responses for the data in Figures 2, D and E, 4D , and 7, B and C, were tested using 2 corrected for multiple comparisons with FDR. To obtain more thorough information and show all the data for the differential responses, the ⌬z-score was computed for the change in firing rate (see Figs. 2, 4 ), LFP (Fig. 6 ), and coherence (Fig. 8 ). ⌬z-score was calculated by measuring in each block of 20 trails the change in any of these parameters elicited by odor stimulation for 2 s divided by the SD of the parameter 2 s before odor addition. As in the past (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008) , there were no differences in the ⌬z-scores under the different conditions before the addition of the odor. Figures 2F-H (top), 3A, 4E, 6F, and 8, A, C, and E, report, for blocks that were differentially responsive to Sϩ and SϪ, pseudocolor histograms of the ⌬z-scores for Sϩ versus ⌬z-scores for SϪ. Figures 2F-H (bottom), 3B, 4F, 6G, and 8, B, D, and F, report the cumulative histograms for the ⌬z-score for either Sϩ or SϪ. The difference in the cumulative histograms for Sϩ and SϪ was tested with paired-sample t tests. In these figures, the ⌬z-score was included for blocks where there were different ⌬z-scores for each block for each unit (block unit) or for each LFP for each unit (block LFP). Table 1 shows the number of block units or block LFPs used in each of these figures. For the behavioral experiments not requiring measurement of sniff (see Figs. 2, 6, 7, 8) , the number of animals and sessions are as follows: go-no go forward, 20 animals, 33 sessions; reversed go-no go, 20 animals, 25 sessions; go-go sessions, 5 animals, 18 sessions. For the experiments requiring measurement of sniff (see Fig. 4 ), the number of animals and sessions are 12 animals and 36 sessions for go-no go sessions, and 3 animals and 12 sessions for go-go sessions. In addition, for the go-no go forward session, the overall population responsiveness including data from all units in all sessions was studied by using principal component analysis (PCA; see Fig. 9 ) as performed previously (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008) . Briefly, we calculated the PCA in 0.15 s intervals throughout the trial using either the number of spikes or the ϒ spike-field coherence. These measures were calculated for the 20 trials in the block (10 Sϩ and 10 SϪ) for all the units recorded from in all the experiments, and were normalized by dividing by the mean of the measure in the 2 s before odor addition. Then the normalized measures were centered to have mean zero and scaled to have an SD of one. The principal components in each time interval were then calculated using the same algorithm as in the princomp function in MATLAB. The input to princomp for each time interval was these normalized measures entered into a two-dimensional matrix with 20 rows corresponding to the 10 Sϩ and 10 SϪ trials and 151 columns corresponding to the units recorded from in all experiments. The output of the PCA in each time interval was a matrix of 20 rows corresponding to Sϩ and SϪ trials and 151 columns corresponding to principal component scores. Finally, for spike-field coherence in the go-no go sessions, we apply a linear classifier to decode sensory stimulus from the ϒ spike-field coher-ence activity of all recorded units (Quiroga et al., 2007; Quiroga and Panzeri, 2009) . This was performed in the first and middle 20 trial blocks to decode which odor (rewarded, Sϩ, or unrewarded, SϪ) was the mouse exposed to on a trial-by-trial basis. For decoding and generating a confusion matrix, the crossval function in MATLAB was used with stratified 10-fold cross-validation using linear discriminant analysis. The input to crossval was the normalized ϒ spike-field coherence for 151 units in nine 0.15 s time intervals starting 0.15 s after odor addition for each of the 20 trials in the block (20 trials by nine time intervals equals 180 entries per unit). In addition, the identity of the odor (Sϩ or SϪ) was provided as input. As described by Quiroga et al. (2007) , decoding results were plotted in the form of "confusion matrices." The values in a given row and column of this 2 ϫ 2 confusion matrix represent the (normalized) number of times a presentation of the Sϩ or SϪ odors are predicted to be Sϩ or SϪ. If the decoding is perfect, Sϩ and SϪ for all trials and the confusion matrix should have entries equal to one along the negative slope diagonal and zero everywhere else. Performance at chance levels should be reflected in a matrix in which each entry has equal probability. Decoding performance was quantified as the percentage of correct predictions, which is the mean of the diagonal of the confusion matrix. For statistical analysis of getting k or more hits by chance, we quantified the number of hits (that is, the average of the diagonal in the confusion matrix) and used a Bernoulli test based on the binomial distribution to obtain a p value (Quiroga et al., 2007) . Finally, we determined the dependence of decoding performance on the number of units by repeating the analysis 10 times with different numbers of units. A random permutation of the order of the units was performed before the subset of units was drawn out for each of these runs. Calculation of responsive and divergent percentages and ⌬z-scores for sniff-locked responses. The method of Cury and Uchida (2010) was used to estimate sniff-locked firing. Briefly, using sniff data, the start of each sniff was detected. The spike firing was determined in 12 intervals from Ϫ25 to 100 ms after the air entered the nose. Sniff-locked spiking patterns were then calculated as performed by Cury and Uchida (2010) for both the average sniff-locked firing rate and for sniff-locked changes in temporal responses (Cury and Uchida, 2010 , their Fig. 1 E ). In our experiment, we found odor-induced changes in the sniff-locked average rate, and very few sniff-locked changes in temporal responses. Because of this, the data were calculated using sniff-locked average rate. The sniff-locked average rate was calculated within each sniff, and the sniff-locked rate was averaged from trial to trial over the entire time course. This was done on a trial-by-trial basis, generating the sniff-locked firing rate that was used to calculate responsive and divergent percentages and ⌬z-scores. A template-matching algorithm (Shusterman et al., 2011) was used to evaluate discrimination success. Results Overall spiking from M/T cells develops differential responsiveness as the animal learns to lick for the rewarded odor To simultaneously obtain information on M/T cell responses, LFP, and sniffing, we implanted tetrodes in the OB and recorded sniffing (Figs. 1, 2A ). In a go-no go behavioral task, mice were provided water if they licked for 2 s for the rewarded odor (Bodyak and Slotnick, 1999; Abraham et al., 2004; Doucette et al., 2011) . Figure 2B shows an example of odor-induced changes in the firing rate that increased as the animal learned to differentiate between odors in a go-no go session. In this figure, data are shown for firing rate in an experiment where the animal responded correctly to 45% of the trials during the first block and 100% of the trials in the sixth block. Importantly, as expected from previous studies (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Doucette et al., 2011) , when all blocks are surveyed for all sessions as the animal developed differential licking to the odors (Fig. 2C ), a fraction of M/T cells developed, in the latter blocks, a differential odor response in the forward go-no go experiments (Fig. 2D , red bars) and also in "reversed" sessions, where the odor that was rewarded in the "forward" session was made unrewarded (and vice versa; Fig. 2E , red bars). We then tested the response of the units in go-go experiments, where the animals were given water reward for licking in 70% of the trials regardless of which of the two odors was presented. In contrast with the results in the go-no go sessions, where licking for one of the odors but not the other is rewarded, in the go-go experiment M/T cells did not develop a larger differential response to the odors in the latter blocks (Fig. 2 D, E , light red bars); a 2 test indicates that in the latter blocks there are statistical differences in the number of divergent responses for go-no go and go-go sessions ( p Ͻ pFDR; pFDR was Ͼ0.02 in Fig. 2 D, E ; for details of data analysis, see Materials and Methods, Table 1 ). Thus, differential spiking rate response to the odors increased throughout the session only when odors were differentially rewarded. In go-no go sessions, units tend to respond to the rewarded odor with increases in firing rate To further extract information on how the animal was responding in go-no go and go-go sessions, we calculated the ⌬z-score in each block, defined as the change in firing rate induced by odor stimulation divided by the SD of firing rate before odor addition. We then generated plots to obtain information on how the units respond in blocks where there is a statistically identified differential response to rewarded and unrewarded odors using this ⌬zscore (for details on statistics, see Materials and Methods, Table 1 ). The complementary plots were a pseudocolor histogram for the number of blocks where a unit responded differentially with different ⌬z-scores for rewarded and unrewarded odors (Figs. 2G, H , top) and a cumulative histogram that shows the relationship of the ⌬z-scores for rewarded versus unrewarded odors for all these differential blocks (Figs. 2G, H, bottom ). These complementary plots showed that odors did not elicit randomly in some M/T units an increase in the firing rate and in others a decrease as expected for odor identification (Yokoi et al., 1995; Mori et al., 1999; Nagayama et al., 2004; Rinberg et al., 2006; Davison and Katz, 2007; Bathellier et al., 2008; Fantana et al., 2008; Khan et al., 2008; Gschwend et al., 2012; Kato et al., 2012) . In contrast, for these go-no go experiments, the firing rate tended to increase when the mouse was exposed to the rewarded odor, as shown by a tendency for a positive ⌬z-score for Sϩ and a decrease in spiking for the unrewarded odor (a tendency for a negative ⌬z-score for SϪ; Fig. 2G, H ). Indeed, the cumulative probability of the ⌬z-score (Fig. 2G ,H, bottom) was different for the Sϩ and SϪ odors (paired-sample t tests, Fig. 2G , p Ͻ 0.001, t ϭ 8.3, df ϭ 107; H, p Ͻ 0.05, t ϭ 2.5, df ϭ 71). In contrast, there was a random distribution of ⌬z-scores for responses to the two odors in blocks where there was no differential response in the go-no go experiments (Fig. 3 A, B ) and in differentially responsive blocks in the go-go experiments (Fig. 2F ). Indeed, pairedsample t test revealed no difference between Sϩ and SϪ for blocks where there was no differential response in the go-no go experiments (Fig. 3B ; p Ͼ 0.05, t ϭ Ϫ0.4, df ϭ 154) and in go-go experiments (Fig. 2F , bottom; p Ͼ 0.05, t ϭ Ϫ1.1, df ϭ 100). Thus, spike rates of M/T cells convey information on odor reward. However, the M/T cells are expected to convey information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome such as odor identity and odor intensity. Because of this, we sought to determine whether the information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome could be extracted from M/T cell spiking either by the sniff-locked spikes (David et al., 2009; Cury and Uchida, 2010; Shusterman et al., 2011; Blauvelt et al., 2013) or by extracting spikes that are coherent (Womelsdorf et al., 2006) with neuronal activity reflected by the LFP in the olfactory bulb. Sniff-locked M/T cell firing becomes differentially responsive to odor in the go-no go task, but not in the go-go task Importantly a fraction of M/T cells have been proposed to carry information on odor identity through sniff-locked transient changes in firing (Cury and Uchida, 2010; Shusterman et al., 2011; Gschwend et al., 2012; Blauvelt et al., 2013) . However, it is not known whether sniff-locked M/T cell firing responsive to odor identity (as opposed to odor reward) occurs during learning when there are strong odor reward-induced changes in the overall firing rate (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Doucette et al., 2011) . Figure 4 shows that during go-no go learning, sniff-locked firing does take place in a subset of M/T cells. Figure 4B is an example showing that there are differential sniff-locked odor responses to the two odors. In addition, Figure 4C (left) shows that for this specific neuron, there is a significant change in odor discrimination success calculated from the changes of spike firing from Ϫ25 to 100 ms after the sniff delivers odor (discrimination success is calculated as indicated in the experimental procedures). Indeed, ϳ10% of 271 units responded differentially with sniff-locked responses to the two odors in the go-no go sessions (Fig. 4D , red bar). Importantly, as in overall firing (Figs. 2 D, E ), for sniff-locked odor-induced changes in firing rate represented by the ⌬z-score, the rewarded odors tended to elicit responses with more increases in firing than the unrewarded odors (Figs. 4 E, F ). Indeed, the cumulative probability of the ⌬z-score (Fig. 4F ) was different for the Sϩ and SϪ odors (paired-sample t test, p Ͻ 0001, t ϭ 8.6, df ϭ 79). In addition, odors did not elicit differential increases in sniff-locked spikes in go-go sessions (Fig. 4D, pink bars). Statistical comparison of the percentages of differential responses to Sϩ and SϪ in go-no go divergent sessions and go-go sessions revealed a difference in odor divergence for the last block (Fig. 4D , compare red bars, pink bars), indicated by p Ͻ 0.001 (pFDR ϭ 0.008) in the 2 test for the last block. Thus, in the go-no go behavior, the sniff-locked responses follow odor reward. LFP conveys information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome We next determined whether the information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome could be extracted from M/T cell spiking by extracting spikes coherent (Womelsdorf et al., 2006) with OB aggregate neuronal activity reflected by the LFP (Ito et al., 2011; Buzsa ´ki and Moser, 2013) . The possibility that the field potential can be used to extract the information carried by M/T cell snifflocked spike firing is particularly relevant because studies have previously suggested that ϒ LFP (65-95 Hz) responds differentially to odors (Kay, 2014; Martin and Ravel, 2014) . Indeed, stimulation with light of the glomerular input in mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in the axons of the olfactory sensory neurons elicited a robust ϒ LFP response (Fig. 5 A, B ). In addition, we also studied LFP (4 -12 Hz) because it is somewhat, but not always, related to sniffs (Kay, 2005; Grosmaitre et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2012; Manabe and Mori, 2013) . Indeed Figure 5C shows examples of the relationship of sniffs and LFP, and Figure 5D shows that there was a strong coherence of the sniff and the LFP. As a result we decided to determine, using coherence of LFP and M/T cell spikes, whether the neural activity underlying the LFP can provide a temporal reference to pull out particular information from spikes. Figure 6A-C shows examples of typical LFP responses in the and ϒ frequencies to rewarded (Sϩ) and unrewarded (SϪ) odors in the forward go-no go task in the first and sixth blocks. As expected from previous studies (Martin et al., 2004; Kay, 2014) , in all blocks, including the first block, there was a significant fraction of LFP and ϒ responses divergent to the rewarded and unrewarded odors (Figs. 6 D, E ). In addition, the change in the power of the LFP elicited by unrewarded and rewarded odors in all blocks where the LFP was different for these two odors took place by both increases and decreases (Fig. 6F ). Interestingly, the cumulative probability of the ⌬z-score for the ϒ LFP when the animal responded to the rewarded (Sϩ) odor was not largely shifted along the ⌬z-score axis compared to the cumulative probability curve for the unrewarded odor (SϪ); the shift along the ⌬z-score axis was much smaller than the SD of the ϒ LFP power (Fig. 6G , gray). Indeed, the cumulative histograms for rewarded versus unrewarded odors were significantly different for , but not for ϒ LFP (paired-sample t test for , p Ͻ 0.001, t ϭ 4, df ϭ 147; ϒ, p Ͼ 0.05, t ϭ Ϫ0.95, df ϭ 110). The fact that LFP responses were both positive and negative in the ⌬z-scores in Figure 6 , F and G, raises the question of whether coherence of the LFP with spike firing (spike-field coherence; Womelsdorf et al., 2006) could convey information relevant to differentiate between odors, regardless of associated outcome. Response of ϒ spike-field coherence to odors is consistent with conveying information to differentiate between odors, regardless of associated outcome Spike-field coherence changes as a function of time during the trials. Figure 7A shows an example where addition of the rewarded odor elicited an increase in a block in coherence in the ϒ frequency. Testing for differences in spike-field coherence with a t test revealed that there were ϳ10% of the blocks where the spike-field coherence for the or ϒ LFP differed between rewarded and unrewarded odors in go-no go and go-go experiments (Fig. 7 B, C ). In contrast, the percentage of divergence between rewarded and unrewarded odors for spike-field coherence for the or ϒ LFP calculated in the 2 s before odor addition was 0%. As expected for information on features such as odor identity or intensity, which should be conveyed whenever the odor is presented, the odor-induced changes in divergence between rewarded and unrewarded trials in spike-field coherence took place for all blocks including the first block (Figs. 7 B, C ). Indeed, for the spike-field coherence with the and ϒ LFPs, the divergence in the responses between rewarded and unrewarded odors for forward go-no go, reversed go-no go, and go-go sessions (Figs. 7 B, C , dark blue, light blue, yellow, respectively) was statistically different from the divergence for the first few blocks for the Sϩ/SϪ odor-induced divergence of responses in overall spike rate (Figs. 7 B, C , red; p Ͻ pFDR, pFDR for coherence ϭ 0.05, dark blue-red, light blue-red; pFDR for coherence ϭ 0.01, yellow-red; pFDR for ϒ coherence ϭ 0.05, dark blue-red, light blue-red, pFDR for ϒ coherence ϭ 0.02, yellow-red). In addition, unlike the behavioral response that increases during the session (Fig. 2C ), the ⌬z-score for spike-field coherence did not tend to change during the session (Figs. 7 D, E ). Divergence in all blocks including the first block and a lack of a change in the ⌬z-score is consistent with conveying information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome. In anesthetized animals where responses of M/T cells to odors through changes in spike rate are clearly elicited by odor identity, the responses are increases in some cells and decreases in others (Yokoi et al., 1995; Mori et al., 1999; Nagayama et al., 2004; Rinberg et al., 2006; Davison and Katz, 2007; Bathellier et al., 2008; Fantana et al., 2008; Khan et al., 2008; Gschwend et al., 2012; Kato et al., 2012) . Figure 8, A, C, and E , shows that the coherence responses to the odors were also found to be either   increases or decreases. This is in sharp difference with the overall spike rate odor responses, where in the go-no go trials there was a tendency for an increase in ⌬z-score for the rewarded odor and a decrease for the unrewarded odor (Figs. 2G, H, top) . Because of this, on average, the cumulative histograms should overlap for Sϩ and SϪ. We studied this issue by plotting the cumulative histograms for ⌬z-scores for the rewarded (Sϩ) versus unrewarded (SϪ) odors (Figs. 8 B, D, F ). For both and ϒ spike-field coherence, the variation in cumulative histograms between Sϩ and SϪ (red and blue lines) was smaller than the SD of odorinduced changes in spike-field coherence (gray background). However, there was a minor difference between and ϒ spikefield coherence. The cumulative histograms were not statistically significantly different between Sϩ and SϪ for ϒ spike-field coherence (paired-sample t test, forward, p Ͼ 0.05, t ϭ Ϫ0.2, df ϭ 115; reversed go-no go, p Ͼ 0.05, t ϭ Ϫ0.2, df ϭ 86; go-go, p Ͼ 0.05, t ϭ 0.9, df ϭ 86). However, the cumulative histograms for Sϩ and SϪ were different for spike-field coherence for forward go-no go sessions (paired-sample t test, p Ͻ 0.001, t ϭ 4.2, df ϭ 115), but not different for reversed go-no go ( p Ͼ 0.05, t ϭ 0.5, df ϭ 182) and go-go sessions ( p Ͼ 0.05, t ϭ Ϫ1.6, df ϭ 86). Therefore, the lack of a difference in cumulative histograms between the rewarded (Sϩ) and the unrewarded (SϪ) ⌬z-scores supports the possibility that ϒ spike-field coherence conveys information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome. Finally, of the 212 units recorded from in the sixth block of the session, 18 units (8.5%) responded divergently in the overall spike rate, and 22 or 16 units (10.4 or 7.5%) responded divergently in the or ϒ spike-field coherence. Of these divergent units, two multiunits and one single unit responded divergently to both the overall firing rate and or ϒ spike-field coherence. ϒ spike-field coherence extracts information on an odor property that is not affected by learning during the go-no go session To analyze the difference between responses of the rate of spike firing and responses of ϒ spike-field coherence to the odors using all the data, we performed PCA including all sessions (Fig. 9 ). The first principal component score allows for differentiation of the odor responses when performed on the ϒ spike-field coherence (Fig. 9I-L ). Interestingly, this divergent coherence response to the odors takes place not only in blocks in the middle of the session (Figs. 9 K, L ), but also in the first block (Figs. 9 I, J ), as indicated by one-way ANOVA for principal component 1 (PC1) in ϒ spike-field coherence (J, F (1,218) ϭ 597, p Ͻ 0.001; L, F (1,218) ϭ 864, p Ͻ 0.001). This is consistent with ϒ spike-field coherence conveying information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome. In contrast, the differential response to the odors in the PCA of the overall rate of spike firing does not take place in the first block (Figs. 9C, D ), but does take place clearly in the middle of the session (Figs. 9 E, F ), consistent with learning during the session to convey information on odor reward through the overall rate of spike firing. One-way ANOVA for PC1 in overall spike firing in the first block (Fig. 9D ) is not significant (F (1,378) ϭ 3.4, p Ͼ 0.05), but it is significant in the middle block (Fig. 9F; F (1,378) ϭ 482, p Ͻ 0.001). This is consistent with learning which odor is rewarded. ϒ spike-field coherence can be used to predict stimulus in the go-no go session The clear separation of Sϩ and SϪ odors in each trial shown in Figure 9H , suggests that a trained observer could predict the odor stimulus based on the ϒ spike-field coherence of the neurons in our study. A linear discriminant decoding analysis was performed to obtain information on whether ϒ spike-field coherence can be used to predict odor stimulus (Sϩ vs SϪ) on a trialby-trial basis in the go-no go experiment with a focus on whether there was a difference between discrimination performance in the first and middle blocks. Figure 10A shows decoding performance in a confusion matrix (see Materials and Methods). The input to the decoding algorithm was the ϒ spike-field coherence values for the first nine 0.15 s time intervals after addition of the odor for all the units recorded in the forward go-no go sessions in the 20 trials in each block (10 Sϩ and 10 SϪ trials). The percentages of hits for the first block and middle block were 96.7 and 96.1%, respectively. They are significantly better than chance ( p Ͻ 10 Ϫ20 , Bernoulli test; see Materials and Methods). Figure 10, B and C , shows the relationship of the decoding performance ( B) and its p value in the Bernoulli test ( C) and the number of units provided to the decoding algorithm. The performance was similar for both the first and middle blocks, and it was better than chance ( p Ͻ 0.05) with more than five units. This decoding analysis shows that the information in ϒ spike-field coherence can be used to predict the odor stimulus as well in the first block of 20 trials, as in the middle block of the go-no go session. Discussion Our data indicate that the coherence of changes in spiking and oscillatory network activity in the ϒ LFP conveys information to differentiate between odors, regardless of associated outcome, whereas the overall firing rate for M/T cells largely conveys information on differential treatment of the rewarded odor that may encode for odor value or top-down attention to the rewarded odor (Fig. 11 ). The ϒ spike-field coherence may be carrying information on odor features such as identity or intensity that are detected from the beginning of a go-no go odor-learning session. Alternatively, ϒ spike-field coherence may not change during the behavioral session because it codes for value and reward in a mix of positive and negative coding schemes. Regardless, we find that ϒ LFP coherence with M/T cell spiking provides information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome. In anesthetized animals, M/T cells respond strongly to odor identity through increases or decreases in the firing rate (Yokoi et al., 1995; Mori et al., 1999; Nagayama et al., 2004; Rinberg et al., 2006; Davison and Katz, 2007; Bathellier et al., 2008; Fantana et al., 2008; Khan et al., 2008; Gschwend et al., 2012; Kato et al., 2012) . Importantly, the presence of distinct groups for each odor in PCA indicates that in these animals, M/T cells in the OB respond differentially to multiple odorants (Bathellier et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2012) . In addition, recording of M/T cell responses in anesthetized animals to intermediate mixtures indicates that representation of an odor can be morphed to the representation of another odor through summation of components (Khan et al., 2008) . Thus, studies in anesthetized rodents solidly show that spike firing by M/T cells can carry information on odor identity. However, in contrast with studies in zebrafish (Blumhagen et al., 2011) and invertebrates (Stopfer et al., 1997; Laurent, 2002; Christensen et al., 2003) , experiments in awake mammals indicate that overall changes in M/T cell firing do not necessarily carry information on odor identity. Indeed, the odor-induced changes in firing rate are, in some awake rodent studies, sparse or absent (Rinberg et al., 2006; Davison and Katz, 2007; Gschwend et al., 2012; Blauvelt et al., 2013; Wachowiak et al., 2013) , but in other studies there are odor-induced increases or decreases in the overall firing rate of 10 -80% of the M/T cells (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Fuentes et al., 2008; Doucette et al., 2011 ; see also Cury and Uchida, 2010; Shusterman et al., 2011) . Importantly, changing behavioral paradigms from passive odorant exposure to active odorant exposure during a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) odor discrimination task elicits changes in the firing rate responses to odors (Fuentes et al., 2008) , suggesting that the responses of changes in overall spike firing do not represent odor identity. Here we provide additional data supporting that in an awake rodent, spike firing in the majority of divergent units does not carry information on odor identity, but rather carries information on odor value or top-down attention to the rewarded odor. Thus, as shown in a previous study (Doucette and Restrepo, 2008) , when the two odors are switched from rewarded (Sϩ) to unrewarded (SϪ) in a go-no go odor discrimination task, the tendency to elicit an increase in firing as a response to the Sϩ odor switches to a decrease after the reversal (and vice versa) (compare Figs. 2G, forward, and 2H, reversal) . This radical switch is not expected for odor identity, but is consistent with the response of a subset of units to a change in odor reward upon reversal. Consistent with conveying information on odor reward when the responses of the overall population of neurons was analyzed by PCA, we found for overall spike firing that there is no divergent PCA response in the first block, but there is a clear differential response for Sϩ versus SϪ in a block in the middle of the session (Fig. 9A-F ). Finally, we show that if the animal is engaged in a go-go task where both odors are rewarded, the number of neurons responding differentially to the odors with overall changes in spike firing is relatively small (compare go-no go and go-go in Figs. 2D and 2E ). These findings indicate that for the majority of divergent units overall spike responses to odors do not carry information on odor identity, but carry information on odor value. Nevertheless, a small number of units responded differentially in all blocks in the go-go task and these units could carry information on odor identity or another odor feature that does not change while  When computed before odor addition, the p values were Ͼ0.05. Finally, when evaluated using the overall spike rate, the decoding performance was 55% ( p ϭ 0.21) for the first block and 58% ( p ϭ 0.16) for the middle block. For chance, the decoding performance was 50%. learning whether an odor is rewarded (also see Doucette and Restrepo, 2008 , their Fig. 4A ). We show that the number of divergent neurons for the overall spiking rate are low at the beginning of the three different task types and that this number greatly increases by block 6 of the go-no go tasks (Fig. 2 ). This finding could be explained by improved odor discrimination during a discrimination task. However, Doucette et al. (2008) showed in their Figure 6 that a unit that developed an inhibitory response to an unrewarded odor in a go-no go behavioral task developed an excitatory response to this odor when it was made the rewarded odor. That change in the polarity of the response is not consistent with simply improved odor discrimination and indicates that changes in firing rate from the majority of the M/T cells carry information on odor reward. However, this does not rule out that a subset of M/T cells convey information on odor identity through changes in spike rate. In fact, the small number of M/T units that respond to the odor in the go-go experiments could be a subset of neurons that respond to odor identity with a change in firing rate. Indeed, comparison of the pseudocolor histograms for the go-no go tasks (Figs. 2G, H ) with that of the go-go task (Fig. 2F ) suggests that this small number of mitral cells respond to odors in the go-no go task as well. The finding that M/T cell spike rates respond to odor value raises the question of whether information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome is conveyed by the M/T cells. Previous studies suggested that sniff-locked M/T cell firing conveys information on odor identity (Cury and Uchida, 2010; Shusterman et al., 2011; Gschwend et al., 2012; Blauvelt et al., 2013) . To provide information on whether the sniff-locked spiking conveys information on odor identity in the go-no go and go-go tasks, we measured sniffing and spike firing in these experiments. In the go-no go task, response to the rewarded (Sϩ) odor tended to be an increase in sniff-locked firing, whereas the response to unrewarded (SϪ) odors tended to be a decrease (Fig. 4F ). In addition, there were no sniff-locked differential responses to odors in the go-go task where both odors are rewarded (Fig. 4D ). Thus, in these experiments, sniff-locked responses to odors do not carry information on odor identity, but likely carry information on odor value. In contrast, past experiments studying sniff-locked spike responses to odors suggest that these carry information on odor identity (Cury and Uchida, 2010; Shusterman et al., 2011; Gschwend et al., 2012) . The behavioral condition of the mice in these previous studies is different from that in ours. In the experiments of Shusterman et al. (2011) and Gschwend et al. (2012) , the animal was exposed to an odor without a behavioral outcome depending on the identity of the odor. On the other hand, in the study by Cury and Uchida (2010) , the animals underwent either an active 2AFC behavior where the animals were given water for correct odor choices or a passive task where the animals received water for all odors. It is likely that in these studies the sniff-locked spike firing was carrying information on odor identity because PCA in the study by Cury and Uchida (2010) suggests that there is distinct separation in the principal component space for different odors. However, given that our study clearly indicates that in our behavioral conditions the sniff-locked spike firing does not transfer information on odor identity, future studies should be performed to determine whether sniff-locked spike firing conveys information under certain behavioral demands. Therefore, in our studies, neither overall spike firing nor snifflocked spike firing carries information to differentiate between odors, regardless of associated outcome. On the other hand, as in previous studies in rodents (Kay, 2014; Martin and Ravel, 2014) , we find that the ϒ LFP is stimulated by olfactory input (Figs. 5 A, B ) and responds differentially to odors (Fig. 6D ). In addition, spike phase synchronization in the ϒ band differs between odorant stimuli for a subset of recorded M/T cells (Fig. 7C ). A local or distal readout process that is sensitive to ϒ phase synchronization could use this information to discriminate between or identify odorants. Indeed, analyzing coherence between the ϒ LFP and M/C cell spike firing (ϒ spike-field coherence), we show that a subset of spikes in M/C neurons transmit information that is not affected by associated outcome (Figs. 7, 8) . Thus, although overall spike firing in the first block of a go-no go session does not respond differentially to the rewarded and unrewarded odors (Figs. 2 D, E ), ϒ spike-field coherence responds differentially to the odors in the first block (Fig. 7C ). Consistent with this finding, PCA and trial-by-trial decoding of ϒ spike-field coherence shows a clear differential response in the first block in the go-no go task (Figs. 9 I, J, 10). These experiments show that ϒ spike-field coherence does not carry information on odor value according to a positive reward-coding scheme as observed for spike rates, and suggests that the ϒ-band phase synchronization of this subset of M/T cell spikes conveys information on a feature such as odor identity or intensity. Thus, our data indicate that the activity of neuronal populations reflected by the ϒ LFP provides the temporal reference frame needed to decode odor features that do not carry information on odor reward. This odor feature could be odor identity or intensity. The mechanism of downstream readout of these spikefield coherence patterns likely involves comparison of M/T cell spikes with some of the aggregate neural activity conveyed by the LFP. Future studies should examine how this information can be pulled out downstream from the OB and whether ϒ spike-field coherence patterns convey information on odor identity. This will likely take place in downstream signal processing similar to signal processing in the dorsal telencephalon circuit in the zebrafish OB (Yaksi et al., 2009) and is likely to involve the feedback circuit from the piriform cortex because optogenetic activation of this cortical feedback elicits a sustained increase in ϒ spike firing in piriform cortex (Boyd et al., 2012) . Future work with optogenetics with the cortical feedback circuit could yield information on the causality of M/T cell ϒ spike-field coherence. Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2.

Figure 11 . 11 Figure 11.The diagram shows a model consistent with the results indicating that the firing of action potentials in the MT cells carries information for odor reward (is the odor rewarded?), and an odor feature that carries information to differentiate between odors regardless of associated outcome, which could be odor identity or intensity, is carried by coherence between spike firing and the ϒ LFP.
