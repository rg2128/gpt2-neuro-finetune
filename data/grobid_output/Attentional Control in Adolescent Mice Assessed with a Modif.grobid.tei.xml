<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Adolescent mice readily acquired the modified 5CSRTT.</s><s>In order to keep the duration of the task within the very short period of mice "adolescence" (i.e.</s><s>≈25-50 days old), the first challenge we had to face was to shorten the long training which is usually required for the classical 5CSRTT for adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>The implementation of three testing sessions randomly presented during the night phase successfully decreased the time needed to acquire the task.</s><s>Indeed, about 85% of mice were able to acquire the task in an average of about 12 days (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>There was no sex-dependent effect on the number of days needed to reach the final stage (F 1,27 = 2.1, p = 0.15; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1b</ref>).</s><s>Notably, at the end of the training phase, mice were still in the middle portion of "adolescence" (≈32 days old).</s><s>This was achieved maintaining a normal adolescent body weight-growing curve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>If ad libitum access to food was kept in the home cage during the light phase of the day, mice typically lost weight the mornings that followed the first 3 nights of testing (F 21,546 = 3.5, p &lt;

0.0005; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1e</ref>).</s><s>Nonetheless, under the two food regime conditions, mice performance did not vary in all parameters described below, a part from the omissions (66.8 ± 2.0 or 59.7 ± 2.0 for day-time food ad libitum or restriction, respectively; p = 0.01).</s><s>This demonstrates that the three test sessions per night were sufficient to keep the normal growing curve of adolescent mice, while ensuring a quick acquisition of the task and maintaining a good level of performance.</s></p><p><s>The 5-7 second inter-trial interval (ITI) shift is not effective in triggering premature responses in male C57BL/6J adolescent mice.</s><s>Upon reaching the training criteria with the basic stage of the 5CSRTT, adolescent mice were exposed to different paradigms with different trial manipulations as summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The impulsivity trait in adult rats and mice becomes appreciable in the 5CSRTT when the ITI is increased from 5 to 7 seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>To test whether a similar outcome could be obtained in adolescent mice, we tested in our modified 5CSRTT paradigm this same 5-7 ITI challenge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>: impulsivity paradigm).</s><s>A significant ITI-by-sex interaction effect was evident for accuracy (F 2,54 = 4.94, p = 0.01) and premature responses (F 2,54 = 6.78, p = 0.002).</s><s>Post-hoc analyses revealed no significant effects for accuracy (p = 0.6;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The data reported here demonstrate that this modified 5CSRTT can effectively test attentional control abilities in adolescent mice.</s><s>Moreover, different challenges in the test were able to detect in adolescent mice: (i) impulsive-like behaviors defined as the ability to refrain to make a preponderant response, (ii) the ability to maintain focused or broad attention when different pre-cue stimuli were presented (SARAT) and (iii) the attentional vulnerability to distractors.</s></p><p><s>While developing the task, preserving the chance to train mice in less than 12 days was crucial for the effectiveness of the task itself.</s><s>Training in the 5CSRTT for adult mice usually requires from thirty days up to several months <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>However, paradigms longer than twenty days would exceed the rodents' short "adolescence" period which is considered to span from about 28 to 45 days of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>Notably, we were able to achieve this also maintaining the physiological curve of adolescent-growing body size, limiting the amount of stress and potential metabolic deficits that could derive from scarce food intake during this developmental period.</s><s>Indeed, most of similar operant-based tasks in adult rodents require a food restriction protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s><s>However, adolescence is a peculiar period for the vulnerability related to nutritional factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>For example, an increasing body of literature illustrates a direct connection between an appropriate nutrition during adolescence and optimal cognitive and brain function <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, this novel paradigm can assess higher order cognitive functions such as attention, compulsivity, impulsivity, distractibility, decision making and processing speed in adolescent rodents with very few confounding factors.</s><s>There is very scarce evidence regarding complex cognitive tasks designed for adolescent rodents.</s><s>For example, intra-/extra-dimensional (ID/ED) set-shifting tasks or a two-choice visual discrimination task (2-CVDT) have been used in adolescent rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> .</s><s>However, in the ID/ED task, adolescent rats were also impaired in basic compound discrimination and in such studies food restriction was applied with no regard to the normal body weight growth of this developmental period.</s><s>More recently, an all-day and self-pace testing in a similar 5CSRTT have been tested for adolescent mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>In contrast to our setting, the latter task did not reveal any difference in performance of adolescents compared to adults, needed an additional cage attached to the 5CSRTT apparatus, required continuous single-housing, and its testing schedule differed from the one used in humans which is restricted in a consecutive and limited time period.</s><s>This latter factor is critical when assessing sustained attention as the self-pace regime greatly reduce the attentional load.</s><s>To note, we are not aware of other similar studies using distracting cues in adolescent mice.</s><s>However, we chose extra visual cues (i.e.</s><s>green flashing lights) randomly presented within the same session to more directly compare attentional performance with that of non-distractor trials, in order to avoid potential habituation processes found with noises <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> and confusion with the use of house lights <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> as reported in adults.</s><s>Finally, as also previously discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , we were able to demonstrate clear differences between the SARAT and distractor paradigms.</s><s>Briefly, the combination of tasks used in the current work show that the cue lights were not simply treated as target stimulus lights, as only non-predictive cues decreased the accuracy and that this was directly proportional to the degree of unpredictability (e.g. 3 vs 5 vs distracting cues).</s><s>The fact that accuracy and the speed of making a correct response were both directly and proportionately modulated depending on the number of valid pre-cues presented also suggested that the mice used the cues to orient attention in anticipation of a target, and that there was a difference in this process between predictive and non-predictive cues.</s><s>Moreover, our data demonstrate that faster reaction time for correct responses in cued trials were not a reflection of trials with responses initiated by the cue and executed after the target light came on.</s><s>Indeed, the speed of correct responses was proportional on the number of cues presented (Cued 1 &gt; Cued 3 &gt; Cued 0 and 5 trials), and distracting cues did not trigger faster reaction responses compared to Cued 0 trials.</s><s>Overall, all the characteristics of our modified automatic task makes it well suitable to dissect different attentional control processes in adolescent rodents also for large genetic or pharmacological screenings.</s><s>This could be relevant in the context of testing early intervention/pharmacological strategies while also understanding their mechanisms.</s><s>Indeed, early intervention on cognitive deficits could potentially be more effective in mitigating or reversing pathological trajectories and ameliorate the quality of life of individuals at risk for psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> .</s></p><p><s>With three different variations, we were able to selectively measure in adolescent mice subtypes of attentional control such as impulsivity, focused or broad attentiveness, processing speed and distractibility.</s><s>In the "impulsivity" paradigm, adolescent female mice, but not males, increased the premature responses impulsivity index when the ITIs were changed from 5 to 7 seconds.</s><s>Previous literature using delay-discounting tests found that both male and female adolescent rats exhibited greater levels of impulsive-like behaviors compared to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> .</s><s>However, other evidence accounted for a substantial impact of hormones in producing sex-dependent differences in impulsive actions in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, it has been demonstrated that in delay-discounting tasks under mild food restriction, adult female mice are more impulsive than males <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> .</s><s>Premature responses are thought to reflect a failure of inhibitory response control that occurs when preparatory response mechanisms are disrupted <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the 5-to-7 ITI shift in adolescent mice might be applied to assess sex-dependent vulnerability to this kind of impulsive control.</s><s>Notably, our protocol offers another option to study impulsive control in mice.</s><s>In particular, in contrast with the 5-7 ITI shift, the pre-cued trials of the SARAT protocol triggered a consistent increase in premature responding in both male and female mice.</s><s>This kind of motor impulsivity is qualitatively different from the one triggered by the increase in ITI.</s><s>Indeed, the pre-cue visual stimuli put forth a pre-potent response, which the mice must withhold from making in order to receive a food reward and then make a correct response.</s><s>Thus, this measure of motoric impulsivity is potentially analogous to "false alarm" errors made in corresponding human tasks.</s><s>Both these manipulations might constitute a valuable tool to assess impulsive behaviors in adolescent mice.</s></p><p><s>In the SARAT paradigm, adolescent mice showed a decreased accuracy in the trials where all the red cue lights were turned on (Cued 5), while faster speed of processing for target cues were evident in trials with more precise pre-cues (Cued 1).</s><s>This pattern of performance was very similar to that of human healthy subjects tested in the original SARAT, where faster reaction times are evident in trials with more precise pre-cues, while cognitive performance is disrupted in trials where the pre-cues provide invalid information about the target <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Thus, this SARAT paradigm might be useful to distinguish deficits in selective attention from deficits in broad monitoring in adolescent mice with good translational validity concerning human studies.</s><s>In particular, this could be relevant for schizophrenia, as patients demonstrate more selective attentional deficits when broad focus of attention is required, rather than when attention must be focused narrowly <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>To date, no study specifically assessed such kind of abilities in adolescent mice, making this an additional tool in preclinical investigations designed to specifically manipulate spatial selective attention.</s></p><p><s>In the Distractor test, we observed a selective disruption of attentional accuracy and increased time out responses in the distractor trials, where non-predictive flashing lights were turned on.</s><s>Adolescence is considered to be a time during which many aspects of behavior including planning, multitasking and the ability to resist distractions, are profoundly shaped <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66</ref> .</s><s>For instance, teenagers have more difficulties to concentrate and are easily distracted <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>The maturation in the resistance to distractors has been associated with a decreased activation in the superior frontal sulcus between childhood and adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> , possibly linked with developmental changes in grey matter architecture and long-range connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>In particular, it seems like cortical brain regions are not fully developed in humans up to the late twenties or even the early thirties, which is much later than previously thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>Thus, in adolescent mice as well as in humans, it would be important to unravel the mechanisms of cognitive vulnerability to distractors, and our modified 5CSRTT might constitute a valid tool in this respect.</s></p><p><s>A comparison between adolescents' and adults' performance in an equivalent task might highlight interesting developmental peculiarities.</s><s>Overall, the performance of adolescent mice here described was similar to that of adult mice tested in an identical 5CSRTT <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , with few important exceptions.</s><s>In particular, the sex-dependent differences in adults showing better performances in females compared to males <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> were not evident in adolescent mice.</s><s>This might reflect long-lasting effects of the sexual hormonal changes that start to appear during puberty <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> , and that are thought to play a critical role in the adult maturation of the cortex and complex cognitive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> .</s><s>In line with this and again in contrast with responses in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , we did not find any effect in C57BL6 male mice in premature responses when the ITIs were changed from 5 to 7 seconds.</s><s>Furthermore, adolescent COMT+/-males showed decreased levels of premature responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), while adult COMT+/have been reported to have increased levels of premature responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , even if a direct comparison with the same 5CSRTT version is still missing.</s><s>However, these effects parallel recent findings unraveling a divergent dopaminergic maturation of the PFC from adolescence to adulthood between males and females <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, these findings raise the intriguing possibility that the COMT-dependent impact on stress vulnerability in terms of cognitive responses (e.g.</s><s>impulsivity as in ref. 34) might develop in male subjects only after adolescence.</s><s>This adds to previous evidence reporting that COMT-by-sex interacting effects are noticeable only between puberty and menopause <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> and with data reporting a different maturation of the dopaminergic system in males compared to females <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> .</s><s>Notably, the SARAT paradigm with only one predictive cue produced attentional advantages in adolescent mice that were not evident in adults.</s><s>Indeed, the increase in correct responses and the decreased omissions seen in adolescents (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) were not apparent in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , indicating an higher attentiveness to extra-cues in adolescents.</s><s>Other developmental differences in the 5CSRTT performance were then evident in the distractor paradigm, as distractor trials triggered larger deleterious effects in adolescents than in adults.</s><s>Indeed, additional parameters (i.e.</s><s>premature, perseverative and time out responses) were altered in adolescent mice other than just accuracy and correct choices as in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , and accuracy level was diminished to ≈40% in adolescents in contrast with ≈70% in adults.</s><s>This might be related to human findings reporting higher vulnerability to distraction in adolescent subjects compared to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Finally, in line with human findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> , the better performance of COMT+/-in the distractor trials suggests that this manipulation might be a more sensible tool in order to highlight the cognitive advantages of COMT genetic reduction in males that were difficult to assess with classical 5CSRTT <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Future studies might want to address trial-by-trial analyses in order to address whether adolescents might emotionally respond differently from adults following correct or incorrect responses.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that even within the brief duration of rodent adolescence, it is possible to assess different attentional control facets by a modified 5CSRTT paradigm.</s><s>Indeed, the adopted manipulations allowed to assess different subtypes of attentional control including impulsivity, focused or broad attentiveness, processing speed and distractibility.</s><s>These features suggest that this task could be a useful tool with potential translational validity concerning
