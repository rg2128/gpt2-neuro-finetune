<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial context improves trial-by-trial detection performance.</head><p><s>To investigate the cellular and network mechanisms underlying spatial contextual modulation, we developed a visual task where mice reported detection of spatially localized stimuli (Gabor gratings, σ = 10°) by licking for water reward.</s><s>Stimuli appeared only after a mandatory period of no licking (0.5-6 s, randomized per trial), and rewards were only available upon first lick during the stimulus (1-1.5 s duration).</s><s>Stimuli appeared with unpredictable timing, but always at one of two discrete locations of visual space (either in the binocular or monocular visual fields; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Stimuli appeared at a range of contrasts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) at one of these spatial locations for the duration of a block of ~25 repeated trials; then, without warning, stimuli switched to the other spatial location for a new block of trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, stimulus location remained spatially fixed within a block of trials, yet alternated locations across blocks of trials.</s><s>This spatial context allowed us to investigate if sequential trials at a fixed location elicited behavioral effects consistent with spatial attention.</s></p><p><s>Indeed, detection was slowest and least accurate on the first trial within the block, when stimulus location was not predictable from the previous trial; thereafter, detection speed and accuracy significantly improved on consecutive trials at the same location (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>, f; time constant of improvement ~5 trials).</s><s>This increase in performance across trials was associated with a progressive increase in hit rates, and an overall decrease in false alarm rates.</s><s>Consequently, detection sensitivity (d') improved significantly within five trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>; from 1.1 ± 0.1 to 1.6 ± 0.1; mean ± s.e.m.; p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</s><s>Criterion also decreased significantly from first (0.37 ± 0.04) to fifth trials (0.22 ± 0.03; p &lt; 0.001, rank-sum test), reflecting that mice tended to respond more frequently with hits on trials later in the block as detection sensitivity improved.</s><s>Critically, behavioral performance required spatially localized activity in V1: optogenetically inactivating monocular primary visual cortex (V1) selectively abolished monocular detection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural response amplitude increases with improved detection.</head><p><s>During these behavioral improvements, neural responses in V1 strengthened.</s><s>We recorded laminar local field potentials (LFP; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) in monocular V1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), and observed a significant amplification of Layer 4 (L4) LFP responses to monocular stimuli, with the same time constant as the simultaneous behavioral improvements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> g-j; 72% increase in LFP response from Trial 1 to 5 for correct detection trials).</s><s>This occurred on the earliest portion of the sensory response across all cortical layers, but most prominently in L4 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>These V1 responses strengthened in the exact same mice and on the exact same trials in which behavior improved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Behavioral improvement is not due to arousal or motivation.</s><s>Changes in arousal, eye position, or motivation did not explain behavioral improvements.</s><s>We measured pupil area as a proxy for global changes of arousal.</s><s>Pupil area prior to stimulus onset remained remarkably constant from first to fifth correct detection trials (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, &lt;0.1% change from mean).</s><s>These changes were tenfold smaller than those preceding correct versus incorrect trials (4 ± 13%, see Speed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ).</s><s>Pupil position also remained stable, deviating &lt;2°from first to fifth trials within the block (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>); these deviations were tenfold smaller than the extent of the visual stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).</s><s>Next, we reasoned that changes in motivation across trials would manifest as measureable changes in licking.</s><s>If motivation for reward increased from first to fifth trials, this should drive impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and increase premature stray licks preceding stimulus onset; likewise, consummatory licks should increase across sequential rewards, if motivation grew.</s><s>However, neither of these scenarios were evident: there was no increase in stray "anticipatory" licking preceding stimulus onset, and no increase in consummatory lick vigor on rewards from first to fifth trials (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results suggest that increased arousal or motivation were not apparent from simultaneous measures of pupil and licking, and neither co-varied with the time course of behavioral improvements.</s><s>Instead, spatial context progressively improved stimulus detection speed and accuracy, while the simultaneously measured neural responses strengthened.</s></p><p><s>These observations in mice are consistent with well-established effects of selective visual spatial attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Neural response enhancements are spatially specific.</s><s>We hypothesized that if response enhancement was due to spatial context, then it should also selectively enhance responses to taskirrelevant stimuli at the same behaviorally relevant locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>We therefore presented task-irrelevant probe stimuli (vertical bars 10°wide, ± 5% contrast from gray screen) during the intertrial intervals separating successive presentations of the grating stimuli detected for rewards (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>Brief probes (0.1 s duration, 0.3 s interval) appeared one at a time in a randomly selected location anywhere in the binocular or monocular visual fields (see the Methods section).</s><s>Since the receptive fields (RF) of our recordings were in monocular V1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), stimulus detection occurred inside the RF on monocular blocks and, conversely, outside the RF during blocks at the binocular location.</s><s>This design allowed us to compare neural responses to the very same taskirrelevant probe stimuli appearing inside the RF in two different spatial contexts in interleaved alternating blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, left versus right).</s><s>Since probe stimuli were faint, brief, and task-irrelevant, they did not elicit any behavioral response: following probe onset inside the RF there was no increase in licking, and stimulus detection accuracy was unaffected (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Probe stimuli inside the RF were thus free from confounds of motor planning or reward association <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> , enabling isolated measurement of the impact of spatial context on sensory processing inside the RF.</s><s>Detection trials inside the RF significantly and selectively enhanced LFP responses to probe stimuli in L4 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>); responses to these same probes did not change across trials during detection outside of the RF.</s><s>Enhancement of the LFP response developed gradually over the course of each block, and with the same time constant as behavioral and neural response enhancement to detected stimuli (cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Probe responses tended to be strongest at sites where neuronal RFs were well-aligned with the detected stimulus location (85% greater modulation when RF location was &lt;10°away from center of detected grating stimulus, versus &gt;10°a way, p = 0.07, rank-sum test).</s></p><p><s>Enhanced neural responses to probes are not due to arousal.</s><s>Arousal did not explain enhanced neural responses inside the RF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>We again used pupil area to segregate trials by arousal level, and found that during detection inside the RF, probes evoked similar amplitude LFP responses in low or high arousal trials; in both cases, LFP responses sorted by arousal level were much smaller than the enhanced LFP responses on the fifth trial of detection inside the RF.</s><s>This spatially selective enhancement of responses to task-irrelevant stimuli mirrors effects of spatial attention in the primate visual system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>). c Same sessions as b, for spikes from fast spiking (FS) putative inhibitory neurons (n = 67, all layers).</s><s>Detection inside the RF increased FS probe responses by 1.1 ± 0.4 spikes per s per trial (p &lt;
