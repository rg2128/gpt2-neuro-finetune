<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Attention to visual features like a specific orientation or motion direction has been shown to enhance visual responses to the attended feature across visual cortex in both monkey neurophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and human fMRI data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Prior studies have reported that feature-based attention enhances responses in neurons tuned to the attended feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, privileges responses to the attended feature under competitive conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and induces shifts of the preferred feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, visual attention to a particular spatial location affects neuronal responses and improves perceptual performance at the attended location [reviewed <ref type="bibr">in 9]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, attention has been shown to enhance neuronal responses by increasing the effective sensory input strength (in our task: coherence gain: Fig 1A <ref type="figure">)</ref> and<ref type="figure">/</ref>or by scaling the responses of the neuron (response gain: Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The Normalization Model of Attention [NMoA: 9] attempts to capture this variety of attentional effects in a single model.</s><s>It proposes that attention multiplicatively scales the driving input to a neuronal population, and the response to this driving input of each individual neuron in the population is divisively normalized by the responses of all the neurons in the normalizing pool.</s><s>Depending on the size of the visual stimulus and the spread of visual attention, the relative effects of sensory stimulation and visual attention on the individual neuron and the normalizing pool differ, leading to input-gain and/or response-gain effects that reproduce many of the effects of spatial attention on neuronal responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Further, fMRI measurements of the spatial spread of visual attention in human subjects provide support for this critical assumption of the NMoA by verifying the model's predictions regarding the influence of the spatial spread of visual attention on behavioral performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, or voxel-averaged neurometric functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The NMoA also captures some of the reported effects of feature-based attention on neuronal responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, using the same underlying mechanism of attentional scaling of sensory responses.</s><s>Importantly, the NMoA predicts that, assuming biologically plausible parameters (see Materials and Methods) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, attention to a visual feature will impact neuronal responses mainly by increasing the effective response of neurons tuned to the attended feature (response gain), rather than by increasing the sensory input strength of the attended stimulus (input gain).</s><s>This implies, given a quasi-linear linking-model relating neuronal responses to behavioral output <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, that attention to a visual feature will not produce input-gain effects, but only response-gain effects on psychometric functions.</s><s>Herrmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> confirmed this prediction when they observed only response gain effects in an experiment where human subjects paid attention to either narrow or broad ranges of orientation.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, we report here that when human subjects are cued to attend to one of two motion directions in a transparent motion display, attentional effects manifest as a combination of input gain (in our task "coherence gain") and response gain.</s><s>Further, different from conclusions drawn by Herrmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we observed a larger impact on input gain for a narrow focus of attention in feature space than for a broad focus, while the observed response gain effect was not significantly different between conditions.</s><s>These results require either a revision of the assumptions linking neuronal activity to behavior, or extensions of the NMoA that include direction-tuned influences on the normalization pool.</s><s>Since given the assumptions of the linking model, psychophysical performance can be used to estimate neuronal responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> as well as to deduce models of divisive normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we propose and compare two possible extensions to the NMoA, introducing either coherence-dependent or coherence-independent direction-tuned normalization.</s><s>The extended normalization models are consistent with the feature-similarity gain model of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and the attentional modulation in extrastriate cortical area MT, where neuronal responses are enhanced and suppressed by attention to preferred and non-preferred motion directions respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>In this study, we measured human psychophysical performance in a direction discrimination task using transparent motion stimuli with varying motion coherence (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We used endogenous cues of varying directional precision and validity to achieve two levels and two directional spreads of voluntary feature-based attention.</s><s>Human perceptual performance was compared for strongly and weakly attended stimuli, directed by cues that were valid in 75% of all trials.</s><s>In addition to these two validity conditions we employed two attentional conditions to generate narrow and wide feature-based attentional distributions to specifically test the critical role that the width of the attentional focus plays in the NMoA.</s><s>For each of the four task constellations of the two cueing validities and the two widths of the attentional focus (validnarrow, invalid-narrow, valid-broad and invalid-broad) we determined performance as a function of stimulus signal strength (motion coherence) and evaluated the effects of featurebased attention on the coherence response function.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cue validity affects performance, especially when attention is focused</head><p><s>To validate whether our cueing paradigm was effective in causing differential attentional deployments, we computed each subject's mean performance across coherences, separately for each subject, attentional condition (valid/invalid) and cue type (narrow/broad).</s><s>We then performed four pair-wise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected Î± = 0.0125, paired t-tests, n = 6 subjects).</s><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the average of these coherence-averaged performances across subjects.</s><s>For both attentional conditions, subjects performed significantly better when the cue was valid than when it was invalid (narrow focus: mean Îd 0 = 0.958, p&lt;0.001, broad focus: mean Îd 0 = 0.358, p = 0.006).</s><s>Further, the performance for the validly cued direction was significantly better in the narrow focus condition compared to the broad focus condition (mean Îd 0 = 0.513, p = 0.003).</s><s>The performance in the invalidly cued direction was not significantly different between the two attentional conditions (mean Îd 0 = -0.087,</s><s>p = 0.24).</s><s>For the statistical tests performed above, we repeated all comparisons with paired, two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank tests.</s><s>This did not qualitatively change our results (i.e.</s><s>all statistically significant results remained significant and all non-significant results remained non-significant).</s></p><p><s>A wide feature-focus causes pure response gain, while a narrow focus causes both coherence and response gain</s></p><p><s>The core aim of our study was to determine whether feature-based attention enhances performance by coherence or response gain and match our findings to the predictions of the NMoA.</s><s>This was done by determining each subject's coherence response function in each of our four task constellations by fitting Naka-Rushton equations (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) with a shared slope parameter for the four conditions.</s><s>The task was tailored individually to each subject (see Materials and Methods section) leading to comparable performances across coherences and to comparable model results across subjects.</s><s>Indeed, performing pairwise t-tests on R 2 -values obtained for each subject and attentional condition, we did not observe significant differences in the goodness of fits for the four task conditions.</s><s>Mean R 2 -values (for 6 individually fitted subjects) were 0.98 (narrow-valid), 0.94 (narrow-invalid), 0.98 (broad-valid) and 0.91 (broad-invalid).</s></p><p><s>We then compared the fitted Naka-Rushton coefficients for validly and invalidly cued trials, to test if attention induced a reduction in c 50 and/or an increase in d 0 max .</s><s>A decrease in c 50 indicates an increase in coherence gain and an increase in d 0 max indicates an increase in response gain.</s><s>We performed four pair-wise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected Î± = 0.0125, paired, one-tailed t-tests, n = 6 subjects, we also performed this analysis with paired, two-tailed t-tests, which did not change our conclusions).    .</s><s>As plotting performance as d 0 might amplify differences at high coherences, we also performed the same analysis based on the proportion of correct responses.</s><s>This did not change the pattern of results (i.e.</s><s>response gain in the broad focus condition and a combination of coherence and response gain in the narrow focus condition).</s></p><p><s>Next, we tested whether the magnitude of coherence (c 50 ) and response gain (d 0 max ) changes with attentional condition (i.e. with an increasing width of the feature-based attentional focus).</s><s>We calculated a modulation index MI z ((a -b)/(a + b), see Materials and Methods section) for each coefficient-condition pair and then performed paired comparisons of the distribution of indices across attentional conditions.</s><s>We find that the magnitude of coherence gain is significantly different between attentional conditions (mean DMI c 50 Â¼ 0:293â82:9%, p = 0.007, paired t-test), while there is no significant change in response gain (mean DMI d0 max Â¼ 0:033â6:8%, p = 0.136, paired t-test, Bonferroni corrected Î± = 0.025).</s><s>For these statistical tests, we repeated all comparisons with paired, two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank tests.</s><s>This did not qualitatively change our results.</s></p><p><s>We further addressed a potentially confounding ceiling effect of performances at high coherences by repeating the above analysis, leaving out the two highest coherences (i.e. the highest performances we measured in our task) of the valid condition in narrow focus trials, thereby disregarding data points that might have been affected by a ceiling effect of performance.</s><s>With this reduced dataset, the increase in response gain narrowly misses significance in the narrow focus condition, however, a coherence gain change was still highly significant.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects used the sample, not the cue direction</head><p><s>The narrow focus cue did not signal the precise direction of the sample stimuli, but rather indicated that the relevant sample was likely to occur within a range of Â±10 degree around the cued direction (heading of the arrow).</s><s>Nonetheless, we tested whether subjects used the cued direction as sample and simply ignored the subsequently presented sample direction.</s><s>If this were true, direction discrimination performance should increase once the test direction was far off from the cued direction.</s><s>Fig 6A shows the performance across coherences for three groups of trials that differ in how far off the cued direction the test direction occurred.</s><s>Groups were defined individually for each subject based on his/her individual direction change magnitude (see Materials and Methods) and we divided the possible range of absolute cue-test differences into three evenly spaced parts (close, medium and far).</s><s>Since upcoming invalidly cued directions could also be inferred from the cue (since the uncued direction range centered Â±135 degrees from the cued direction), we were able to define the same three groups for invalidly cued trials.</s></p><p><s>For each group we find significant effects of cue validity (paired t-tests, p&lt;0.001, p = 0.002, p&lt;0.001 for close, medium and far, respectively) while pairwise comparisons indicated that none of the three groups of validly cued trials was significantly different from the others.</s><s>The same was true for the invalidly cued trials (all p&gt;0.027,</s><s>Bonferroni corrected Î± = 0.0083, n = 6 comparisons).</s><s>We thus find no evidence pointing towards subjects using the cue direction (rather than the sample direction) as a reference for the direction discrimination task in the narrow focus condition.</s></p><p><s>We also tested whether sample presentations occurring far from the cued direction resulted in improved task performance.</s><s>For this purpose trial groups were defined as sample directions close (0-2 degrees), medium (3-6 degrees), and far (7-10 degrees) from the cued direction (or the inferred uncued direction).</s><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6B</ref> shows the performance across coherences for those three trial groups.</s><s>Similar to the trial grouping by sample-test difference, we find significant effects of cue validity (paired t-tests, p = 0.001, p&lt;0.001, p = 0.001, for close, medium and far, respectively).</s><s>Again, no pairwise comparison between groups was significant for either valid or invalid trials (all p&gt;0.02,</s><s>Bonferroni corrected Î± = 0.0083, n = 6 comparisons).</s><s>This suggests that in the narrow focus condition, the featural extent of attention covered at least a range of 20 degrees, centered on the attentional cue, which we also assumed in all model simulations.</s></p></div>

physiologically plausible assumptions (see Materials and Methods), it is also limited in flexibility and cannot predict certain patterns of responses, such as a reduction of input gain, but not response gain, caused only by a widening of the attentional focus.</s><s>Since many assumptions underlying the NMoA's parameters are not easily verified, such predictions of "impossible results" are critical because they allow the model to be stringently tested against empirical data.</s><s>Here, we report that human subjects show behavioral performance patterns that go against a prediction of the NMoA and suggest and compare two simple and testable extensions to the NMoA that can account for the findings.</s><s>As pointed out by Herrmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the NMoA predicts that under biologically plausible parameter settings, attention to a visual feature like orientation or motion direction will only produce response-gain effects in neuronal response functions.</s><s>Given that changes in the neuronal representation are assumed to scale quasi-lineary to behavioral performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, these effects imply that similarly, only response-gain effects will be found when comparing psychometric functions measuring performance on tasks involving attended and unattended features.</s><s>Herrmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> went on to confirm this prediction by showing only response gain effects in psychometric functions when subjects paid attention to either narrow or broad ranges of orientation.</s><s>Here, we built on this work by measuring the performance of human subjects on a task requiring them to discriminate a direction change in one of the two directions of a transparent motion display.</s><s>Performance increased with motion coherence and was greater for validly cued stimuli.</s><s>However, in contrast to Herrmann et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> results for attention directed to orientations, we found that attentional effects manifest as a combination of input gain and response gain on the psychometric function.</s><s>Critically, when we compared the effects of attention directed towards either a narrow or broad range of motion directions, we  found a significant decrease of input gain, but not response gain, for the broad focus, which cannot be readily accounted for by the original formulation of the NMoA.</s></p><p><s>Our results using a motion direction discrimination task differ from those of Herrmann et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> task using orientation discrimination, despite the fact that the two tasks are conceptually very similar.</s><s>One difference is that we varied coherence rather than contrast to manipulate signal strength in order to obtain a sufficiently large dynamic range.</s><s>Currently, there is only limited evidence describing the effect of coherence changes on neurometric functions.</s><s>Available results indicate that, at least for non-transparent motion patterns, the coherenceresponse function in MT is much more linear than the contrast-response function <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Sigmoidal coherence-response functions have also been reported in macaque MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>It is not obvious why these differences between the coherence and contrast-response functions should cause the difference in our results.</s><s>Our results show that adding either a coherenceindependent contribution of attention to normalization or a coherence-dependent mechanism of self-normalization to the NMoA is sufficient to fully account for our data.</s><s>This points to potential differences in the attentional contribution to normalization between our results and Herrmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Further research is needed to determine how different stimulus properties and task demands might lead to different amounts of stimulus-dependent and stimulusindependent feature-based attentional contributions to neuronal normalization.</s></p><p><s>We suggest two possible extensions of the NMoA both including direction-tuned influences on the normalization pool.</s><s>The first model (NMoA+ciN) implements a coherence-independent, attentional contribution to normalization.</s><s>Here, attention not only modulates the input drive to a neuronal population, but also reduces the impact of the normalization on the responses of neurons tuned for the attended direction.</s><s>Further, the data indicate that such a tuned normalizing effect of attention would have to be greater when attention is more narrowly focused than when it is broadly distributed.</s><s>To implement such a specific rescaling of the coherence-independent normalizing input in the brain, we suggest that since the NMoA can be considered a steady-state version of an unspecified network model with mutual competition, a stimulus at the preferred direction of the neuron could suppress the local population that is tuned to non-preferred directions and thereby reduce their contribution to the normalizing pool.</s><s>Alternatively, we propose in the second model (NMoA+cdN) that each neuron preferentially weights its own contribution to the normalization pool (self-normalization) in comparison to the contribution of all suppressive neurons.</s><s>Such a mechanism was previously shown to be a vital component in a model capturing the response properties of direction-selective neurons in extrastriate cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The tuned normalization in another recent report <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is also conceptually similar: here, the authors showed that MT neuronal responses to a pair of stimuli within the receptive field (one moving in the preferred direction and the other in the anti-preferred direction) were well explained by direction-tuned divisive normalization.</s><s>The majority of neurons in their data showed a greater normalizing influence of the preferred stimulus.</s><s>We show here that extending the NMoA with an explicit tuned-normalization component also captures our results in an attention task, despite the fact that this coherencedependent mechanism is independent of the spread of attention.</s><s>However, the difference between the two extensions is significant and the NMoA+cdN model described the data worse than the NMoA+ciN model.</s></p><p><s>The proposed NMoA+ciN model modifies the normalization mechanism to include a reduction by feature-based attention of the normalizing influence for neurons tuned to the attended direction.</s><s>There are a variety of ways in which this modification could be implemented.</s><s>For example, if feature-based attention suppresses the responses of neurons tuned to non-preferred directions, their contribution to the normalization pool could be reduced thereby reducing the coherence gain for neurons tuned to the attended direction (but increasing it for neurons tuned to the unattended direction, where the normalization pool will be enhanced).</s><s>Alternatively, feature-based attention may enhance both the "stimulus drive" as well as the "normalization" for neurons tuned to the attended direction, and this effect may manifest as coherence gain.</s><s>Importantly, here the direction selectivity of the normalization pool is not critical, but instead, attention has a selective effect on neurons tuned to the attended direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the mechanism works even if the normalization pool is untuned, but critically, it may also work when the normalization pool is tuned.</s></p><p><s>In a related framework, Boynton <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed a normalization model with a stimulus independent contribution of attention to the normalization pool.</s><s>This untuned normalization can account for attentional effects of input gain when attention is directed inside versus outside of a neuron's receptive field.</s><s>For non-spatial forms of attention, as described here, a feature-tuned input to normalization is necessary since attention does not shift out of the receptive field.</s><s>It should be pointed out, however, that the proposed extension with a coherence-independent, tuned input to normalization (NMoA+ciN) can similarly be applied to this or other previously proposed models of attentional normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr"

imagine an important alternative to account for our empirical results.</s><s>The hypothesized modifications all assume, that the behavioral effects of attention and its spread emerge from its effects on the neuronal representations of the stimulus (i.e. the perceptual representation).</s><s>However, attention may also act by modifying the decisional mechanism, for example, through enhanced weighting of the cued stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref

performance between validly and invalidly cued features could result from the differential weighting of inputs from the two motion directions, with greater weight given to the validly cued feature.</s><s>With a lower weight to the unattended motion direction, the performance may only rise above chance once the coherence becomes sufficiently large.</s><s>Similarly, the change in performance for validly cued motion directions between trials with focused or dispersed feature-based attention may be due to improved weighting of the same perceptual representation, rather than an effect of attention on the perceptual representation itself (as we assume here).</s><s>Differentiating between these two alternatives may require physiological recordings that examine the effects of feature-based attention under our conditions in the dorsal motion-processing pathway in order to measure the underlying neuronal coherence-response functions.</s></p><p><s>Spatial attention has been shown to affect correlations within neuronal populations encoding visual features <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> and to reduce single-neuron variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>Such effects can cause improvements in psychophysical performance even without increases in neuronal responses.</s><s>The NMoA does not consider such attentional effects and thus aims to account for changes in psychophysical performance by changes in mean spiking activity.</s><s>Consequently, we have assumed that the attentional modulation of psychophysical performance is independent of changes in correlations between neuronal firing of individual neurons.</s><s>Additional experiments are needed to clarify to which degree feature-based attention causes changes in both neuronal correlations and neuronal variability and how those potential effects translate into changes in psychophysical performance.</s></p><p><s>Attention to an anti-preferred motion direction suppresses the responses of MT neurons across the visual field in a multiplicative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>This finding inspired the feature-similarity gain model of attention which postulates that attending to a particular motion direction (or more generally, visual feature) enhances the responses of neurons tuned to the attended motion direction and suppresses the responses of neurons tuned to the opposite motion direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The NMoA can account for these findings by postulating that feature-based attention to the non-preferred direction increases its contrast or coherence-dependent contribution to the normalizing pool.</s><s>Both of the proposed extensions to the NMoA do not compromise these previous predictions made by the NMoA, since they both contain the original model as a special case.</s><s>However, the NMoA+ciN model has an additional mechanism whereby featurebased attention to the preferred direction has a coherence-independent "pure attentional" effect on the normalizing pool.</s><s>This attentional influence can release a neuron from the suppressive effect of normalization when its preferred direction is attended.</s><s>Measuring the extent to which these two effects contribute to the enhancing and suppressive effects of feature-based attention will require experiments specifically designed to tease apart these two effects.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our results support and extend the popular NMoA with a modulatory mechanism specific to feature-based attention.</s><s>This will allow the NMoA and similar models of attention and divisive normalization to cover an even wider set of conditions.</s><s>As our extensions generate testable predictions, they are well suited to guide further research into the mechanisms

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>To test whether the two types of attentional cues led to measurable attentional effects, we compared each subject's mean performance over all levels of coherences between both attentional conditions.</s><s>We calculated performance as d 0 = zscore(p CWcorrect ) -zscore(p CCWfailure ), where 'p CWcorrect ' is defined as the proportion of clockwise responses to clockwise changes, and 'p CCWfailure ' as the proportion of clockwise responses to counter-clockwise changes.</s><s>Using paired t-tests we determined whether performance differed between trials with narrow and broad focus cues and confirmed that attention was deployed in line with each cue type, as indicated by a significant difference between validly and invalidly cued trials.</s></p><p><s>In order to determine whether attention affected performance by response or coherence gain we investigated separately for each attentional condition, how each subject's performance changes with motion coherence.</s><s>To obtain the coherence response function, we fitted a Naka-Rushton equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref></s></p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d 0 c Ã° Ã Â¼ d 0 max c n c n Ã¾ c 50 n</formula><p><s>to each experimental condition using a non-linear least-squares procedure.</s><s>Using this equation, psychophysical performance d 0 for each level of coherence c can be described by the asymptotic performance at high levels of coherence d 0 max , the coherence level at half asymptotic performance c 50 and the slope of the function n.</s><s>We tested with one-tailed, paired t-tests whether changes in c 50 and d 0 max occurred from invalidly to validly cued trials for each attentional condition.</s><s>Significant increases in d 0 max represent response gain effects and significant decreases in c 50 represent coherence gain effects.</s><s>The slopes of the corresponding coherence response functions for each attentional condition were constrained to be equal in all four fits per subject to minimize the number of free parameters.</s><s>We validated this choice by comparing this reduced model (with a single exponent per subject) to those with two exponents per subject (one for each attentional condition) and to those with four exponents per subject (one for each attentional condition and cue validity).</s><s>The reduced model with a single exponent per subject produced almost identical fits and was clearly preferred (due to its lower number of parameters) by AIC and BIC measures.</s><s>We evaluated further-reduced models with shared parameters (d 0 max or c 50 ) either across or within attentional conditions, but found that no simpler model was superior to the one described above.</s><s>A robust fit of the coherence response functions requires that the asymptotic performance saturates at high levels of coherence.</s><s>We therefore excluded two subjects with performance increases of Îd 0 ! 1 between the two highest coherence levels, leaving a total of 6 subjects for the final analysis.</s></p><p><s>To determine the coherence gain and response gain changes between attentional conditions, we computed a modulation index for each of the gain enhancements:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_8">MI z Â¼ z valid Ã z invalid z valid Ã¾ z invalid</formula><p><s>where z corresponds to one of the two fitted coefficients c 50 or d 0 max .</s><s>We calculated the differences in modulation magnitude between conditions and tested with paired t-tests if the effect sizes of coherence and response gain varied significantly between the two attentional conditions.</s><s>All statistical tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons.</s><s>Data analysis was done using custom scripts in Matlab R2014a (MathWorks).</s><s>We used the Palamedes routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> for fitting psychometric functions and the Matlab Curve Fitting toolbox (MathWorks) for the non-linear fitting.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model simulations</head><p><s>To simulate our empirical data with the NMoA, we used custom Matlab scripts, based on the code of Reynolds and Heeger <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>We changed the original code to use a circular von Mises distribution for both the stimulation and the attention fields' theta dimension.</s><s>Therefore we express the width of the feature-attention spotlight in terms of parameter Îº, which is the concentration of the distribution around it's mean (1/Îº is roughly equivalent to Ï 2 of a gaussian).</s><s>We confirmed that this modified model produces similar results to the original NMoA by comparing our results with the outcome of the Matlab scripts available on the authors' website.</s></p><p><s>We modeled our empirical results by defining a stimulus that is infinite in space, since no spatial position inside the annulus carried more relevant signal than any other and thus spatial attention could not have impacted psychophysical performance.</s><s>Consequently we assumed that for modeling purposes, spatial attention was evenly distributed across all spatial locations.</s><s>The two directions of the transparent motion display were modeled as two narrow bands in the theta dimension, each with a concentration of Îº = 33, corresponding to roughly 10 degrees Ï.</s><s>The means of the two signals were 135 degrees apart from each other, corresponding to the mean difference in motion directions of the transparent motion display.</s></p><p><s>Assuming a quasi-optimal attentional allocation according to the task design we then simulated an attentional field with either a narrow or a broad focus of feature-based attention.</s><s>The exact choice of field width turned out to be not critical for the main finding (see Results section for details).</s><s>The narrow focus was an enhancement with a concentration (angular extent) of Îº = 15 around one of the signals.</s><s>The broad focus was centered on the same direction (i.e. as if it were a horizontal movement), but enhanced a much broader range of directions around it (Îº = 0.5, which corresponds roughly to 90 degrees Ï).</s><s>Our model MT population was defined to have Gaussian receptive fields with a spatial extend of Ï = 5 degrees and a tuning width of Ï = 37 degrees.</s><s>The suppressive field was defined to have a spatial kernel width of Ï = 20 degrees and a feature tuning width of Ï = 180 degrees.</s><s>The latter parameter was used since it is known that in motion selective area MT, surround tuning is present, but is generally very broad <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>Overall, this biologically plausible set of parameters is very similar to the one used in previous simulations by Herrmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> or Reynolds &amp; Heeger <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We modeled increasing levels of coherence by increasing the value of the sensory input strength parameter c.</s><s>In the NMoA, this essentially equates increases in coherence to increases in contrast.</s><s>This choice (also made by Jazayeri and Movshon <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> in a related context) is supported by the physiological finding that MT units do not change their tuning for linear motion with changes in motion coherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s>In order to convert the modeled population activity into a prediction of behavioral performance, we assumed that task performance is dominated by the quality of decoding of the two motion directions of stimulus display 1.</s><s>Consequently, we selected two units of the simulated population with their tuning centered on the corresponding directions of stimulus display 1 (out of which one was previously cued and thus in the focus of attention).</s><s>We assumed that task performance on validly and invalidly cued trials is proportional to the values of the neurometric function for the attended and unattended unit respectively.</s><s>A large value of the neurometric function translates to a greater signal-to-noise ratio for the neural representation and a better identification of the stimulus directions.</s><s>Since the direction-difference between the sample and test directions was small, units tuned to the sample directions also responded strongly to test directions and received levels of attentional enhancement similar to units tuned to the test directions.</s><s>Therefore, their neurometric functions would also be proportional to detection performance for presented test stimuli.</s></p><p><s>In order to obtain the neurometric functions for relevant units, we repeated the simulation for varying values of c (i.e.</s><s>signal to noise ratios of the two bands in theta).</s><s>Through appropriate rescaling with just one additional parameter, we converted the neuronal activity of the relevant unit (depending on cue validity) into psychophysical performance.</s><s>Importantly, as shown by Pestilli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, such a readout which equates attentional effects on neuronal response functions with those on behavioral psychometric functions (after a rescaling) leads to the same conclusions as those given by a more detailed implementation of an ideal likelihood-based observer <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Even when using this ideal observer to predict behavioral psychometric functions from the underlying modeled neuronal representation, the attentional effect on the behavioral psychometric function mimics the attentional effect on the underlying neuronal functions.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
