<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>limitations.</s><s>First, real-time imaging is both technically demanding and restricted to small fields of view, should one desire single-cell resolution.</s><s>Second, these indicators allow one to only passively observe calcium patterns, but not to respond to them -for example, to selectively manipulate or further characterize subsets of neurons based on their history of activity.</s></p><p><s>A recently reported tool, CaMPARI, addresses the first limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>CaMPARI is a calciumand light-gated photoswitchable fluorescent protein.</s><s>Upon coincident detection of both elevated calcium (&gt;111 nM) and violet light, CaMPARI stably converts from a green-emitter to a red-emitter.</s><s>In contrast to real-time calcium indicators, CaMPARI allows one to integrate the history of calcium elevations in single neurons during time windows defined by the violet light.</s><s>Subsequently, one can fix the cells or tissue and slowly acquire highresolution, single-cell data across the entire sample.</s><s>However, CaMPARI does not address the second limitation, because it provides only a color readout.</s><s>A more general solution would couple coincident detection of elevated calcium and light in a living cell to transcription of any reporter gene of interest, whether a fluorescent protein, a toxin to ablate neuronal activity, or an opsin to permit subsequent light control of neuronal activity.</s><s>Furthermore, to improve upon the characteristics of CaMPARI, a new tool would ideally offer light-gating outside of UV wavelengths, which is toxic to cells.</s></p><p><s>We designed a light-and-calcium gated transcription factor (TF) system, called FLARE (for Fast Light-and Activity-Regulated Expression), shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>.</s><s>In the basal state, the TF is tethered to the cell's plasma membrane, unable to activate transcription of the reporter gene located in the cell's nucleus.</s><s>Upon exposure to both blue light and high calcium, however, the TF is cleaved from the membrane and translocates to the nucleus because (1)  the protease recognition site is unblocked by the light-sensitive LOV domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , and (2) the protease is recruited to its recognition site via a calcium-regulated intermolecular interaction between calmodulin (CaM) and a CaM binding peptide.</s><s>High calcium alone is not sufficient to give TF release because the protease site remains blocked, and light alone is not sufficient because the protease is far away, and its affinity for its recognition site is too low to give substantial cleavage in the absence of induced proximity.</s><s>Also key to this design is that both calcium sensing and light sensing are fully reversible, such that sequential rather than coincident inputs (such as high calcium followed by light) are unable to trigger TF release.</s></p><p><s>The calcium-sensing mechanism of FLARE resembles the protein proximity-sensing mechanism of Tango <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , a tool developed for visualization of GPCR activity.</s><s>Tango utilizes the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease (TEVp), which is appealing for its high sequencespecificity; in mammalian cells, TEVp does not recognize and cleave any endogenous proteins.</s><s>For our initial FLARE constructs, we thus utilized the TEVp/TEVp cleavage site (TEVcs) pair from Tango.</s><s>However, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1B</ref> (columns 4-6) shows that these constructs gave no detectable difference in fluorescent protein expression after transient exposure of HEK 293T cells to ionomycin-induced high calcium versus low calcium conditions.</s><s>Inspection of the images indicated a problem with high background in the low calcium (untreated) cells.</s><s>Expression levels of tool components in these cells could reach 250 uM or more, exceeding the K m of the Tango TEVp/TEVcs pair (240 uM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> ).</s><s>This would explain the high extent of TEVcs cleavage even in the absence of calcium-induced proximity.</s><s>Cterminally truncated TEVp has reduced affinity for TEVcs sequences (K m ~450 μM), with minimal reduction in k cat <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> (Figure SI-1).</s><s>We thus tested truncated TEVp in FLARE, along with two different TEVcs sequences (higher affinity and lower affinity) and three alternative CaMbp sequences.</s><s>All 12 permutations are shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1B-C</ref>.</s><s>As expected, truncated TEVp reduced background signal overall, enabling us to observe a difference in fluorescent protein expression between calcium-treated and untreated cells.</s><s>Of the three CaMbps tested, M2 gave the lowest background.</s></p><p><s>For light-gating of FLARE, we select the LOV domain because it has been used in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , is reversible <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , and does not require addition of exogenous cofactors as the Phy-PIF system does 15 .</s><s>To test light gating, we fused the LOV2 domain from Avena sativa <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> to two TEVcs sequences, "biting back" 2, 3 or 6 amino acids into LOV2's C-terminal Jα helix (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1E</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1F</ref> shows that of 6 constructs tested, the best one gave only a light-to-dark signal ratio of 2 and dark state expression was high for all LOV2 fusions.</s></p><p><s>For FLARE to be a useful tool, it is imperative to minimize dark state leak.</s><s>FLARE will be expressed in cells for days or even weeks prior to the experiment of interest.</s><s>During this time, the cells may experience many calcium rises, but we require negligible TF release.</s><s>Subsequently, a short period of light irradiation permits TF release, if calcium is also elevated at the same time.</s><s>The large difference in duration between the dark period (days to weeks) and the light exposure period (minutes) necessitates a very large light-to-dark signal ratio for FLARE.</s><s>We found that this was not possible to achieve with the published LOV2 protein (G528A/N538E mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>We thus turned to directed evolution to improve the light caging efficiency of LOV for the TEVcs sequence.</s><s>We reasoned that specific mutations in LOV2 might enhance the interactions between LOV2 and C-terminally fused TEVcs in the dark state, leading to better steric protection and minimal cleavage by TEV protease in the dark state.</s><s>To implement the evolution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>), we mutagenized LOV2 (G528A/N538E mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ) by error prone PCR, fused it to the TEVcs, and displayed the library on the yeast cell surface via fusion to the Aga2p mating protein.</s><s>To perform positive selections for efficient TEVcs cleavage in the presence of blue light, we incubated the yeast library with purified TEVp for 1 hour under a light source.</s><s>After staining with antibody-fluorophore conjugates, we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to enrich yeast cells displaying low anti-Flag/anti-HA fluorescence intensity ratios, indicative of TEVcs cleavage.</s><s>Negative selections for resistance to TEV cleavage in the dark were implemented by incubating the yeast library with purified TEV protease in the dark for 3 hours, then using FACS to enrich cells with high anti-Flag/anti-HA fluorescence intensity ratios, indicative of intact TEVcs.</s><s>We performed 6 rounds of alternating positive and negative selections (Figure SI-2).</s><s>These gradually enriched the yeast population displaying LOV mutants with both high TEVcs cleavage in the light state (yellow bars, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>) and low TEVcs cleavage in the dark state (grey bars, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Sequencing of enriched clones from round 6 (Figure SI-3) identified five mutants of interest, three of which were superior to original LOV2 (G528A/N538E mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ) on the yeast surface (Figure SI-4).</s><s>We manually combined mutations present in these clones into a single LOV gene to create "eLOV", for evolved LOV.</s><s>On the yeast surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>) and in HEK mammalian cells (Figures 2D and SI-5), eLOV was clearly superior to the original LOV2 mutant for light gating of the TEVcs, especially in the dark state, where Citrine expression resulting from TEVcs cleavage was now minimal.</s><s>The quantified light-to-dark signal ratio in HEK was 23, in contrast to 2 for the original LOV2 mutant under identical conditions.</s><s>As anticipated, the introduction of light gating also improved the calcium response of the toolby reducing the time window for possible accumulation of background signal.</s><s>The same modules (truncated TEVp, M2 CaMbp) that gave a high-to-low Ca 2+ signal ratio of only 2 in HEK (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1C</ref>) now gave a ratio of 16 with eLOV incorporated (S/N of 5 with original LOV2 mutant incorporated) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The 5 mutations in eLOV enriched via directed evolution are highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref>.</s><s>For example, Leu2, located in a flexible loop, is mutated to Arg in eLOV.</s><s>Perhaps this causes the formation of a salt bridge with the Glu sidechain in TEVcs (ENLYFQ ▲ Y), leading to tighter dark state caging.</s><s>H117 is located in the loop that connects the Jα helix to the rest of the LOV domain.</s><s>H117R in eLOV could potentially stabilize Jα in the dark state by forming a salt bridge to E123 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">SI-4C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We then proceeded to test our tool in the more challenging environment of neurons.</s><s>Calcium increases in neurons are much more dynamic than the sustained 5-minute calcium rises we artificially induced with ionomycin in HEK cells and cell surface proteins that traffic well in HEK frequently fail to do so in neurons.</s><s>To address these and other challenges in transitioning FLARE from HEK to neurons, we made a number of changes and improvements to the tool as follows (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>).</s><s>First, we expanded our testing of TEVcs sequences (Figure SI-6).</s><s>Second, we replaced the CD4 segment of FLARE with a neurexin-3β-derived transmembrane domain, which is half the size, and facilitates packaging into adeno-associated viruses (AAVs).</s><s>Third, we replaced Gal4 with the tTA-VP16 transcription factor, which has subnanomolar DNA binding affinity and a stronger transcriptional activation domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Fourth, to facilitate the translocation of cleaved TF from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, we inserted a soma targeting sequence into FLARE.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref> shows that these modifications all contributed to improved FLARE performance in neuron culture.</s></p><p><s>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C-D</ref> show imaging of our final FLARE tool in cultured rat neurons at DIV17.</s><s>The tTA-VP16 transcription factor drives expression of TRE-mCherry in the nucleus.</s><s>Light stimulation was 10 or 15 minutes using 467 nm blue light at 60 mW/cm 2 and 10-33% duty cycle.</s><s>To elevate intracellular calcium, we used either electrode stimulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3D</ref>), or we replaced half of the culture media with fresh media of the same composition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref>).</s><s>We then allowed neurons 18 hours after calcium and light stimulation to transcribe and translate mCherry.</s><s>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C-D</ref> show that mCherry expression was robust only in one of four conditions in each experiment, when neurons were subjected to both light and activity.</s></p><p><s>There was some detectable background signal in the light exposed/non-stimulated cells (&gt;10-fold less than with stimulation) but this may reflect basal calcium activity (Figure SI-8), as we did not repress/silence these neurons.</s><s>Notably, mCherry expression was barely detectable in all dark state conditions, attesting to the effectiveness of eLOV in caging TEVcs from protease cleavage over the entire 7-day expression window (light-to-dark signal ratios of 121 and 17, respectively, in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To characterize the sensitivity of FLARE, or the amount of neural activity required to give a transcriptional output with reasonable signal-to-noise ratio, we delivered light to neurons for various lengths of time, coincident with two forms of activity stimulation (electrical stimulation or media change) (Figures 3E and SI-9).</s><s>Media change produced a robust signal (signal-to-noise ratio of 10) in just 4 minutes, whereas electrode stimulation (at 20 Hz) produced an 11-fold signal increase after 8 minutes.</s></p><p><s>The temporal resolution of FLARE is governed by the speed at which FLARE turns on and off.</s><s>Based on previous literature, the LOV domain and intermolecular CaM-CaMbp binding are both activated in 1 second or less <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>We measured the reversion kinetics of eLOV, or the speed at which light-activated eLOV "re-sets" to the dark state.</s><s>Figure SI-10 shows that the reversion time constant is 140 seconds, similar to the time constants of original LOV2 (G528A/N538E mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ) and WT-LOV2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To empirically test the overall off-rate of FLARE, we staggered light and calcium inputs by various time intervals.</s><s>If activated eLOV required many minutes to reset to the dark state, then blue light stimulation followed by electrical stimulation would still produce mCherry expression, because the TEVcs would remain accessible for some time after the blue light is removed.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3F</ref> shows that even with an interval as short as 1 minute separating light and calcium inputs, mCherry expression is not detectable.</s><s>This demonstrates that eLOV reverses to the dark state in less than 1 minute, before the subsequent light stimulus is applied.</s><s>Similarly, calcium followed by light, with only a 1 minute intervening gap, produces no mCherry expression.</s><s>Based on these observations, we conclude that the temporal resolution of FLARE is 1 minute or less.</s></p><p><s>Next, to test if FLARE indeed works by the mechanism that we designed, we performed imaging in neurons using FLARE components containing targeted mutations.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3G</ref> shows that mutation of the calcium-binding EF hands of the calmodulin domain, or deletion of the M2 CaMbp peptide from the TF component of FLARE, or mutation of eLOV to remove the cysteine that crosslinks with flavin (C48A) all abolish mCherry expression in the +light +activity condition.</s></p><p><s>We tested whether FLARE could be used for functional re-activation of selected neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4A</ref>).</s><s>Instead of driving mCherry expression, we used FLARE to drive expression of a light-activated ion channel, ChrimsonR (a red-shifted depolarizing channlerhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ), fused to mCherry, in neurons exposed to both blue light and electrode stimulation (for 15 minutes).</s><s>With such a short, single-session stimulation, would opsin expression levels be sufficient to enable functional reactivation of FLARE-marked neurons? Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4B</ref> shows ChrimsonR-mCherry expression in previously-stimulated neurons but not in untreated neurons.</s><s>Recording of GCaMP5f fluorescence in response to pulses of opsin-activating red light shows that FLARE-marked cells can indeed be re-activated to give calcium transients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To test the potential utility of FLARE for in vivo applications, we injected AAV viruses encoding FLARE components into the motor cortex of adult mice.</s><s>Blue light was delivered via implanted optical fiber, and mice were stimulated via wheel running (single 30 minute session).</s><s>24 hours later, mice were perfused and imaged for ChrimsonR-mCherry expression to quantify FLARE activation.</s><s>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4D-E</ref> and SI-11 show that FLARE is minimally activated in the absence of blue light exposure.</s><s>A small but statistically significant (p = 0.013) increase in signal intensity was observed in animals that were running during the blue light period compared to animals that were inactive (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4D</ref>-E, SI-11 and SI-12).</s><s>To see if FLARE could drive sufficient levels of ChrimsonR expression for functional manipulation, we performed whole cell patch clamping of mCherry-positive neurons in the motor cortex of light/running animals, and observed robust red-light induced action potentials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4F</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4G</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that FLARE is sensitive to light and elevated calcium in the in vivo context as well.</s></p><p><s>A tool that retains memory of past calcium rises has distinct benefits over the real-time calcium indicators that are used ubiquitously in neuroscience.</s><s>Such a probe integrates calcium activity over user-defined time windows, stores the information in a form that survives cell fixation, and permits the user to carefully survey the entire sample at high resolution over large fields of view.</s><s>FLARE is such a memory probe, with the additional powerful capability that it can convert calcium memory into transcriptional regulation of any transgene of interest, giving FLARE enormous versatility.</s><s>In our study, we showed that FLARE-expressing cells exposed simultaneously to blue light and activity for just 10-15 minutes produced active transcription factor that drove the expression of EYFP, Citrine, mCherry, or channelrhodopsin.</s><s>Figure SI-13 shows that FLARE can also drive the expression of APEX2, a peroxidase that is useful for electron microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and proteomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Other transgenes of interest to couple to FLARE include halorhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> or tetanus toxin <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> to silence neuronal activity, and DREADDs to regulate neuronal activity with chemical ligands. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s> the properties of the previously published Tango 9 and LOV 7 modules proved inadequate for achieving high signal-to-noise ratios, it was necessary to engineer improved components.</s></p><p><s>In particular, we truncated the TEV protease and replaced the TEVcs (after screening 8 variants) to produce a much more proximity-dependent system with higher signal-to-noise for calcium sensing.</s><s>For light gating, we performed directed evolution to create eLOV, a light-sensitive protein module that gates the protease recognition site in FLARE with a lightto-dark signal ratio of &gt;120.</s><s>Though evolved for one TEVcs sequence in particular, eLOV is more effective than LOV2 (G528A/N538E mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ) at caging a variety of sequences, including recognition sites for other proteases (data not shown).</s><s>Our study illustrates the ability of directed evolution to optimize tool characteristics, and produces improved modules that should also be valuable for other protein engineering efforts.</s></p><p><s>Though promising, our in vivo results highlight aspects of FLARE that should be improved to render it a robust and generally applicable tool for circuit mapping in animals.</s><s>We observe heterogeneity across animals and even across sections from the same animal, because FLARE activity is highly expression-level dependent, and we delivered the tool components via viral injection.</s><s>Though dark state leak is negligible in neuron culture, we observed some light-independent background in vivo that could be addressed by further engineering of the light gate.</s><s>Finally, the sensitivity of FLARE is limited by TEV protease turnover rate, which is only 10.8 min -1 (and likely much lower for TEVp variants such as split TEVp 27 ); a faster protease variant could further reduce time windows of tagging.</s><s>Given the impact that existing "memory trace" tools -that use drug delivery and washout for temporal gating, resulting in tagging time windows of 6-24 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> -have had on systems neuroscience, a future FLARE tool that works more robustly in vivo on the timescale of seconds should provide access to the study and manipulation of a much wider array of cognitive processes.</s></p></div>
