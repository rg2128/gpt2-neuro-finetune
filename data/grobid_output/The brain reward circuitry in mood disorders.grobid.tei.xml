<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The brain's reward circuitry</head><p><s>The best characterized reward circuit in the brain comprises dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which is part of the ventral striatum.</s><s>The principal neurons of the NAc are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs).</s><s>This VTA-NAc circuit is crucial for the recognition of rewards in the environment and for initiating their consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , but these regions respond as well to aversive stimuli (see below for further discussion).</s><s>VTA dopamine neurons also innervate several regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdala and hippocampus, among other areas (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>All of these so-called 'brain reward regions' are inter-connected in complex ways; for example, the NAc receives dense glutamatergic innervation from the PFC, amygdala and hippocampus; and the PFC, amygdala and hippocampus form reciprocal glutamatergic connections with one another.</s><s>The functional output of each of these regions is modulated by several types of GABAergic interneurons and, in the NAc, by cholinergic interneurons as well.</s><s>Moreover, each of these regions receives serotonergic inputs from midbrain raphe nuclei and noradrenergic inputs from the pontine locus coeruleus, and several are innervated by hypothalamic peptide systems.</s><s>Finally, there is evidence that VTA 'dopamine' neurons also release glutamate or GABA, which may contribute to their functional effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>There is now a large literature, stretching from rodents to monkeys to humans, concerning the role this highly complex and inter-connected circuitry plays in discerning and reacting to rewarding and aversive stimuli in the environment and in influencing future responses based on past experience.</s><s>We refer the reader to several recent reviews for a more detailed discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . His</s><s>orically, brain reward regions have been assigned specific behavioral functions: the VTA-NAc as a 'rheostat' of reward, the amygdala as crucial for forming associative fear-and reward-related memories, the hippocampus as mediating declarative memory, and various regions of the PFC as subserving distinct aspects of working memory and executive control.</s><s>In reality, these regions have far broader functions in regulating emotional and cognitive behavior.</s><s>Indeed, the complexity of the reciprocal connections and local monosynaptic circuits within the larger reward circuitry has made parsing individual pathways and functions a major methodological challenge.</s><s>The ways in which this circuitry contributes to depression remain even more uncertain.</s><s>One view is that the reduced responses to rewarding experiences and exaggerated responses to aversive ones that characterize depression might -together with the associated maladaptive cognitive style -reflect abnormalities in the perception and interpretation of reward valence, in the motivation for rewards, and in subsequent decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr"

.</s></p><p><s>Recent technological advances in mouse genetics, viral-mediated gene transfer and optogenetics have made it possible to determine the roles of specific neuronal cell types in reward-related behavior to a degree that was not possible in earlier investigations.</s><s>In an initial study, Deisseroth and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> used a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin (ChR2), to show that stimulation of VTA dopaminergic neurons was sufficient to drive intracranial self-stimulation in rats.</s><s>Optogenetic stimulation of these neurons also promoted a conditioned place preference, confirming their role in inducing reward, whereas stimulation of GABAergic interneurons in the VTA disrupted reward and promoted conditioned place aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> .</s><s>In the NAc, optogenetic stimulation of D1-type MSNs enhanced cocaine-induced place conditioning and locomotor activation, whereas stimulation of D2-type MSNs had the opposite effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of D1-type neurons in the dorsal striatum induced a persistent increase in operant lever pressing, whereas stimulation of D2-type neurons induced a transient decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>This and related work supports the view that the dorsal striatum is also a crucial site for integrating behavioral responses to both positive reinforcement and punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s></p><p><s>A recent study demonstrated the potent ability of optogenetically activated cholinergic interneurons in the NAc to promote the rewarding effects of cocaine <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , even though these interneurons comprise &lt;1% of all neurons in this region.</s><s>Perhaps surprisingly, inhibition of the cholinergic interneurons by a small and previously unappreciated GABAergic projection from the VTA enhanced stimulus-outcome learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Further work is needed to clarify these findings, but they are interesting in light of pharmacological studies in rodents and monkeys showing that cholinergic agonists are rewarding through their actions within the VTA-NAc <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Circuit-specific tools are also being used to study the influence of distinct glutamatergic projections to the NAc (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) on complex behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> .</s><s>As just one example, optogenetic activation of NAc glutamatergic terminals that derive from the BLA was reinforcing, whereas activation of terminals from the PFC was not <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Recent evidence also points to a role for lateral habenula (LHbL) and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) neurons in mediating aversion.</s><s>Specifically, a subset of GABAergic neurons in the RMTg <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> -those that project to VTA dopamine neuronsreceive excitatory projections from LHb neurons that respond specifically to aversive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Optogenetic stimulation of LHb glutamatergic terminals in the RMTg inhibited firing of VTA dopamine neurons, inducing a greater degree of behavioral avoidance in response to an unpredictable foot shock <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>VTA dopamine neurons themselves are far more heterogeneous than was previously believed: distinct subsets of VTA dopamine neurons respond differently to rewarding versus aversive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , and there are topographical (anterior versus posterior) differences in the influence of VTA dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in regulating reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Together, these studies illustrate how genetic, viral vector and optogenetic tools are leading to the formulation of fundamentally new hypotheses regarding reward circuitry function.</s><s>Such work highlights the cell-and circuit-specificity of neural pathways and neurotransmitter systems that control the VTA and NAc.</s><s>It is clear that many regions that are not classically defined as 'reward structures' feed onto this circuitry and contribute to the processing of both positive and negative emotional information to guide complex behavior.</s><s>With this in mind, we can begin to formulate a detailed circuit-level understanding of reward-related deficits in mood disorders.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brain imaging studies in humans</head><p><s>The brain imaging literature with regard to depression is extensive and has been reviewed elsewhere in greater detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Here, we highlight only those major findings that inform our understanding of reward mechanisms in depression.</s><s>In general, volumetric structural and metabolic activity changes have been identified throughout the reward system in mood disorders.</s><s>The results are complicated and often, for each positive finding, opposite or null findings appear in the literature, emphasizing that results should be interpreted with caution.</s><s>Such variable findings are not surprising, given the considerable heterogeneity among patients with depression.</s><s>For example, many of the studies that identify volume reductions in reward regions based on gray matter loss are biased towards older individuals, and it is possible that gray matter loss accompanies depression symptoms mainly in these populations but may not be a general biomarker of depression.</s><s>Keeping this in mind, we review structural and functional changes reported in brain regions that make direct monosynaptic connections with the VTA-NAc.</s><s>Findings from postmortem human brains that inform the imaging studies are discussed as well (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nucleus accumbens</head><p><s>Numerous studies have shown no change in NAc volume in major depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , although several studies of mainly elderly patients reported a loss of NAc volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>Activity of the NAc (and ventral striatum as a whole) is consistently reduced in major depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>This is thought to reflect a loss of reward function that drives symptoms such as anhedonia, however, the interpretation of these data is complicated.</s><s>First, it is estimated that &gt;98% of neurons in the NAc are GABAergic, such that a decrease in BOLD activity or cerebral blood flow might reflect a decrease in the inhibitory output of this region.</s><s>Second, the effect of an increase or decrease in the GABAergic output of the NAc on reward behavior is complex, with opposite effects observed for D1-type versus D2-type MSNs in mice, as stated above <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>These imaging studies of NAc of patients with mood disorders need to be complemented with neuropathological examination of postmortem brain tissue (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Recent evidence suggests that genes that promote synaptic remodeling are regulated in the NAc of depressed subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , although detailed neuroanatomical studies of NAc structure are not available.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basolateral amygdala</head><p><s>Although several studies have identified volume loss in BLA gray matter in patients with mood disorders upon postmortem examination <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> , many showed no change <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>There is greater consensus regarding functional changes.</s><s>Most fMRI studies have shown the BLA to be hyperactive in a range of mood disorders, both at baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and in response to stimuli such as sad faces or negative words <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> , possibly reflecting the increased negative emotional and cognitive state often seen in these conditions.</s><s>It remains unclear whether this signal reflects increased activity of glutamatergic projection neurons, GABAergic interneurons, glial cells or other cells, but rodent studies have shown that chronic stress may induce depression-or anxiety-like behavioral responses by increasing excitatory tone on glutamatergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prefrontal cortex</head><p><s>Studies of PFC have concentrated largely on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial PFC (mPFC), including the anterior cingulate cortex.</s><s>Patients with major depression have smaller cortical volume -including reduced white matter volume -in OFC and mPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> .</s><s>In the ventrolateral and dorsomedial PFC, depressed subjects show smaller BOLD signal changes measured by fMRI during a reversal-learning task <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> , although it should be noted that Brodmann area 25 (also known as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex) shows increased activity in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s><s>The changes in size and activity of PFC are thought to result, in part, from the loss of glial cells or the neuronal atrophy that is evident in postmortem tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>These findings support the hypothesis that mood disorders are characterized in part by a loss of excitatory cortical control over subcortical reward-related structures such as NAc and amygdala, leading to aberrant processing of rewarding and aversive events.</s><s>A crucial question, however, as with the amygdala, is what cellular element in OFC and mPFC is responsible for the reduced cortical activity seen in fMRI studies.</s><s>Interestingly, a recent study in depressed humans indicates dramatic reductions in excitatory synapses in the mPFC, supporting the hypothesis that decreased BOLD reflects a loss of excitatory tone in this region <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> .</s><s>Further studies are needed to understand the functional consequences of the reported loss of glial cell density <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>One possibility is that they contribute to abnormal glutamatergic transmission.</s><s>It should also be emphasized that monkey studies are particularly important for discerning the influence of distinct PFC regions in mood and motivation, given the relatively rudimentary PFC in rodents.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hippocampus</head><p><s>Owing to its dense reciprocal connections (direct and indirect) with the VTA and NAc, the hippocampus is thought to strengthen memory encoding based on the valence of a stimulus.</s><s>It has been suggested that people with mood or anxiety disorders have memory encoding errors that result in exaggerated or misinterpreted experiences of the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</s><s>Many studies have found reduced hippocampal volume in depression or other stress-related disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> , although again this seems to be found mostly in studies of middle-aged or elderly subjects.</s><s>Histological analysis of postmortem brains from depressed humans suggest that reduced volume is due, in part, to synaptic and glial loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Studies of hippocampal activity in depression are limited and often conflicting.</s><s>A recent study showed that depression is associated with a reduced BOLD signal in the right hippocampus during a positive word-encoding task <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> .</s><s>These findings led the authors to speculate that in mood and anxiety disorders the hippocampus does not properly encode rewarding memories and that this may make an individual insensitive to positive information.</s></p><p><s>Although the literature summarized above has contributed to the formulation of a systemslevel understanding of depression, there are still areas of controversy and major questions remain unaddressed.</s><s>For example, the VTA and LHb, well established in controlling responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli, are relatively small and have not yet been characterized functionally or structurally in human depression.</s><s>In general, postmortem neuroanatomical analyses in support of fMRI data have been limited to the hippocampus and mPFC.</s><s>Moreover, as we have highlighted, currently available brain imaging methods in humans do not have the resolution to differentiate cell types and cannot distinguish between changes in excitation or inhibition.</s><s>As discussed below, the ability to genetically target specific cell populations within monosynaptic reward circuits in rodents makes it possible to test the functional relevance of specific cells and circuits in controlling depression-like behavior.</s><s>Such advances may one day enable the development of new imaging methods for diagnostic (biomarker) screens for these syndromes.</s></p></div>
