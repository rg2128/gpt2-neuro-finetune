<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The ability to perceive external information via sensory systems is crucial for an animal to navigate and survive in a complex environment.</s><s>In a classical view, the brain processes sensory information solely based on a hierarchical organization where sensory information is shaped and refined by subsequent processing steps.</s><s>However, to guarantee appropriate, flexible, and fast reactions in a rapidly changing environment, it is beneficial to implement additional mechanisms that modulate information in a situation-dependent fashion.</s><s>One way to do so are cortical topdown projections, where sensory information is received from sensory cortices, and processed information is then transmitted to downstream centers to modulate incoming sensory signals.</s></p><p><s>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying sensory perception thus requires information on the neural circuits involved in both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>One prominent center of cortical top-down projections in olfaction is the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), an olfactory cortical area located in the forebrain just caudally of the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay station of olfactory signals within the brain.</s><s>The AON can be divided into two distinct zones, pars externa, a thin ring of cells in the rostral part of the AON, and pars principalis containing the majority of AON cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Valverde et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brunjes et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Its extensive connectivity with primary and secondary processing centers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brunjes et al., 2005)</ref> and its position as both a "bottom-up" relay of ascending sensory input from the OB and a source of "top-down" input to the OB renders the AON an interesting model system for investigating higher-order olfactory processing and the interplay of ascending and descending information.</s></p><p><s>The AON is the largest source of cortical projections to the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carson, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Shipley and Adamek, 1984)</ref>.</s><s>AON-derived axons have been shown to project to multiple layers of the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Reyher et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Padmanabhan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Wen et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>This includes the granule cell layer, which contains the majority of inhibitory interneurons of the OB, as well as the layers containing the output neurons of the OB, the external plexiform, and the mitral cell layer.</s><s>Furthermore, AON projections are bilateral;
