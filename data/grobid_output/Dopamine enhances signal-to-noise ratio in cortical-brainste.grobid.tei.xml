<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Despite the popularity of the SNR model for mPFC DA in computational and theoretical neuroscience, the degree to which it translates across brain functions is unknown.</s><s>Support for DA-mediated SNR has been found in ex vivo preparations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and in vivo during auditory stimulus discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , visual stimulus discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , and working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Considering mPFC neurons rapidly respond to both rewarding and aversive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and that DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) projecting to the mPFC (VTA DA -mPFC) are uniquely sensitive to aversive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> , we hypothesized that mPFC neurons encoding aversive or rewarding events are differentially modulated by DA.</s></p><p><s>Previous characterizations of DA release in the mPFC in response to aversive stimuli have either been direct but slow <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> or fast but indirect <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) offers a direct measurement of catecholamine neurotransmission with precise temporal resolution, but is rarely used beyond the striatum due to difficulty in discriminating between norepinephrine (NE) and DA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Here, we investigated the precise time course of DA release using FSCV combined with optical and pharmacological approaches to dissect VTA DA contributions.</s><s>Electrodes were aimed at deep layers (5-6), where VTA DA terminals were densest, relative to locus coeruleus (LC) NE terminals (LC NE ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">1a-b</ref>), and secured in locations detecting stimulated DA release (Extended Data Fig 1).</s><s>In tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)::Cre rats expressing halorhodopsin (NpHR) in a Cre-dependent manner in VTA DA neurons, we performed tail pinches with and without photoinhibition of VTA DA neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1c</ref>).</s><s>Photoinhibition of VTA DA neurons attenuated the pinch-induced signals in the mPFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1d-e</ref>).</s><s>Further, in a separate group of rats, pharmacological inactivation of the LC did not affect pinch-evoked catecholamine release in the mPFC (Extended Data Fig 1).</s><s>These data suggest that VTA DA -mPFC contributed the bulk of the pinch-evoked, timelocked catecholaminergic signal.</s></p><p><s>Next, we explored the causal relationship between VTA DA -mPFC and valence processing by testing whether this circuit component was sufficient to induce aversion.</s><s>In TH::Cre rats, we Cre-dependently expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in VTA DA neurons and implanted optical fibers over the mPFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1f</ref>).</s><s>Activation of VTA DA -mPFC had no effect in realtime place avoidance (RTPA) or conditioned place aversion (CPA) assays (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref>).</s><s>However, in light of the model for DA involvement in enhancing SNR, we considered whether DA might enhance responses to discrete, predictive cues.</s><s>We trained rats to associate auditory or visual cues (counter-balanced) with either shock or sucrose delivery.</s><s>Once rats learned to discriminate the cues predicting shock or sucrose by freezing or approaching the sucrose port, respectively (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref>), we tested their behavioral responses to the "competition" of simultaneously presented cues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1g</ref>) driving conflicting motivational outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1h</ref>).</s><s>Photostimulation of VTA DA -mPFC (using empirically-determined optical parameters, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1i</ref>) during the "competition" trials caused ChR2 rats to spend significantly less time in the sucrose delivery port and more time freezing compared to eYFP controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1j-k</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these data suggest that DA is released in a time-locked manner upon an aversive stimulus and that VTA DA in the mPFC biases behavioral responses towards aversion in the face of conflicting motivational drives.</s></p><p><s>We next sought to identify distinct, anatomically-defined subpopulations in the mPFC that might relay information relevant to aversive processing.</s><s>The mPFC has many downstream projection targets, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3</ref>).</s><s>In animal studies, stimulation of the PAG evokes aversive responses, including defensive and attack behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> .</s><s>While projections to the dorsal PAG (dPAG) have been explored in the context of social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , contributions of the mPFC-dPAG circuit to discrete stimulus processing have not yet been evaluated.</s><s>Due to its reported role in reward-related processes, we also investigated the mPFC-NAc projection for comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with previous results <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , we found that mPFC-dPAG and mPFC-NAc formed anatomically distinct subpopulations (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To target these pathways, ChR2 or eYFP alone was Cre-dependently expressed in either mPFC-dPAG or mPFC-NAc neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref>).</s><s>Photostimulation of mPFC-NAc neurons did not produce detectable differences in behavior between ChR2 and eYFP expressing groups during RTPA or CPA (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, activation of mPFC-dPAG::ChR2 reduced the time spent in the light-paired chamber in both RTPA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2b</ref>) and CPA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2c</ref>), relative to eYFP controls.</s><s>In the open field test, which assays locomotor activity and anxiety-related behavior, mPFC-dPAG photostimulation did not affect distance traveled (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2d</ref>) or time spent in the center of the chamber between ChR2-and eYFP-expressing rats (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Strikingly, mPFC-dPAG photostimulation produced a robust increase in marble burying and time spent digging (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2e</ref>-h and Supplementary Video 1).</s><s>The effects in the RTPA and marble burying assays observed upon mPFC-dPAG somata activation were reproduced by activation of mPFC terminals directly in the dPAG (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Thus far, our data show that optogenetic activation of the mPFC-dPAG projection drives place avoidance and defensive behaviors; however, optogenetic activation may not reflect endogenous circuit function.</s><s>To address this, we investigated the dynamics of individual neurons in the mPFC-dPAG and mPFC-NAc populations during punishment (shock) or reward (sucrose).</s><s>We performed in vivo microendoscopic imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> of neurons expressing a genetically-encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6m) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>GCaMP6m was selectively expressed in mPFC-dPAG and mPFC-NAc neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3a</ref>), to visualize changes in intracellular calcium concentration indicative of neural activity.</s><s>Assessment of bulk activity revealed that the mPFC-NAc population was not significantly modulated by either shock or sucrose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, mPFC-dPAG neurons showed a robust, time-locked increase in activity in response to foot shock and a decrease in response to sucrose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3c</ref>).</s><s>To assess the activity of individual projection-defined neurons, we used a constrained non-negative matrix factorization algorithm optimized for microendoscopic imaging (CNMF-E) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3d</ref> and Supplementary Video 2 &amp; 3).</s><s>We identified 169 mPFC-NAc and 118 mPFC-dPAG neurons that sorted into 6 functional clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3e</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>When comparing the normalized responses of individual cells within each population, mPFC-NAc responses were heterogeneous while mPFC-dPAG responses were robustly biased towards shock (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3f</ref> and Supplementary Video 4 &amp; 5).</s><s>Further, mPFC-dPAG neurons had transients that were both more frequent and higher amplitude during shock sessions, compared to mPFC-NAc neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Based on these functional and anatomical differences, we next hypothesized that DA might differentially impact mPFC-NAc and mPFC-dPAG populations.</s><s>To test whether DA had different effects on the intrinsic excitability of

avoidance strategies, which requires tuning of valencedefined circuits.</s><s>We speculate that DA in the mPFC primes top-down neural circuits that encode aversive stimuli in order to promote avoidance and escape-related defensive behaviors.</s><s>These findings have clinical relevance to neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by DA dysregulation in the mPFC.</s><s>For example in schizophrenia, hyper-dynamic mesocortical DA may prime aversion-encoding pathways and underlie pathologies in paranoid schizophrenia, such as the tendency to assign negative motivational salience to otherwise neutral stimuli.</s><s>Our data suggest that mesocortical DA governs information routing down discrete mPFC projections and highlights the need for targeted circuit-specific DA therapies in

linked.</s><s>As they were paired into binary clusters, the newly formed clusters were grouped into larger clusters until a hierarchical tree was formed.</s><s>A a threshold at 0.3 × max(linkage) was set to prune branches off the bottom of the hierarchical tree, and assign all the neurons below each cut to a single cluster.</s><s>After clusters were constructed, data from the PAG and the NAc
