<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programmable Nucleases as Tools for Efficient and Precise Genome Editing</head><p><s>A series of studies by Haber and Jasin <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rudin et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Plessis et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rouet et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Choulika et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bibikova et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bibikova et al., 2003)</ref> led to the realization that targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) could greatly stimulate genome editing through HR-mediated recombination events.</s><s>Subsequently, Carroll and Chandrasegaran demonstrated the potential of designer nucleases based on zinc finger proteins for efficient, locus-specific HR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bibikova et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bibikova et al., , 2003))</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, it was shown in the absence of an exogenous homology repair template that localized DSBs can induce insertions or deletion mutations (indels) via the error-prone nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ) repair pathway (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bibikova et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>These early genome editing studies established DSB-induced HR and NHEJ as powerful pathways for the versatile and precise modification of eukaryotic genomes.</s></p><p><s>To achieve effective genome editing via introduction of site-specific DNA DSBs, four major classes of customizable DNA-binding proteins have been engineered so far: meganucleases derived from microbial mobile genetic elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Smith et al., 2006)</ref>, zinc finger (ZF) nucleases based on eukaryotic transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Urnov et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Miller et al., 2007)</ref>, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) from Xanthomonas bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Christian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Miller et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boch et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Moscou and Bogdanove, 2009)</ref>, and most recently the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 from the type II bacterial adaptive immune system CRISPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cong et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mali et al., 2013a)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Meganuclease, ZF, and TALE proteins all recognize specific DNA sequences through protein-DNA interactions.</s><s>Although meganucleases integrate its nuclease and DNA-binding domains, ZF and TALE proteins consist of individual modules targeting 3 or 1 nucleotides (nt) of DNA, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>ZFs and TALEs can be assembled in desired combinations and attached to the nuclease domain of FokI to direct nucleolytic activity toward specific genomic loci.</s><s>Each of these platforms, however, has unique limitations.</s></p><p><s>Meganucleases have not been widely adopted as a genome engineering platform due to lack of clear correspondence between meganuclease protein residues and their target DNA sequence specificity.</s><s>ZF domains, on the other hand, exhibit context-dependent binding preference dueto crosstalk between adjacent modules when assembled into a larger array <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Maeder et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Although multiple strategies have been developed to account for these limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gonzaelz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sander et al., 2011)</ref>, assembly of functional ZFPs with the desired DNA binding specificity remains a major challenge that requires an extensive screening process.</s><s>Similarly, although TALE DNA-binding monomers are for the most part modular, they can still suffer from context-dependent specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Juillerat et al., 2014)</ref>, and their repetitive sequences render construction of novel TALE arrays labor intensive and costly.</s></p><p><s>Given the challenges associated with engineering of modular DNA-binding proteins, new modes of recognition would significantly simplify the development of custom nucleases.</s><s>The CRISPR nuclease Cas9 is targeted by a short guide RNA that recognizes the target DNA via Watson-Crick base pairing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>The guide sequence within these CRISPR RNAs typically corresponds to phage sequences, constituting the natural mechanism for CRISPR antiviral defense, but can be easily replaced by a sequence of interest to retarget the Cas9 nuclease.</s><s>Multiplexed targeting by Cas9 can now be achieved at unprecedented scale by introducing a battery of short guide RNAs rather than a library of large, bulky proteins.</s><s>The ease of Cas9 targeting, its high efficiency as a site-specific nuclease, and the possibility for highly multiplexed modifications have opened up a broad range of biological applications across basic research to biotechnology and medicine.</s></p><p><s>The utility of customizable DNA-binding domains extends far beyond genome editing with site-specific endonucleases.</s><s>Fusing them to modular, sequence-agnostic functional effector domains allows flexible recruitment of desired perturbations, such as transcriptional activation, to a locus of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Xu and Bestor, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beerli et al., 2000a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Konermann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maeder et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mendenhall et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In fact, any modular enzymatic component can, in principle, be substituted, allowing facile additions to the genome engineering toolbox.</s><s>Integration of genome-and epigenome-modifying enzymes with inducible protein regulation further allows precise temporal control of dynamic processes <ref type="bibr">(Beerli et al., 2000b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Konermann et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CRISPR-Cas9: From Yogurt to Genome Editing</head><p><s>The recent development of the Cas9 endonuclease for genome editing draws upon more than a decade of basic research into understanding the biological function of the mysterious repetitive elements now known as CRISPR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), which are found throughout the bacterial and archaeal diversity.</s><s>CRISPR loci typically consist of a clustered set of CRISPRassociated (Cas) genes and the signature CRISPR array-a series of repeat sequences (direct repeats) interspaced by variable sequences (spacers) corresponding to sequences within foreign genetic elements (protospacers) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Whereas Cas genes are translated into proteins, most CRISPR arrays are first transcribed as a single RNA before subsequent processing into shorter CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), which direct the nucleolytic activity of certain Cas enzymes to degrade target nucleic acids.</s></p><p><s>The CRISPR story began in 1987.</s><s>While studying the iap enzyme involved in isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase in E. coli, Nakata and colleagues reported a curious set of 29 nt repeats downstream of the iap gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ishino et al., 1987)</ref>.</s><s>Unlike most repetitive elements, which typically take the form of tandem repeats like TALE repeat monomers, these 29 nt repeats were interspaced by five intervening 32 nt nonrepetitive sequences.</s><s>Over the next 10 years, as more microbial genomes were sequenced, additional repeat elements were reported from genomes of different bacterial and archaeal strains.</s><s>Mojica and colleagues eventually classified interspaced repeat sequences as a unique family of clustered repeat elements present in &gt;40% of sequenced bacteria and 90% of archaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Mojica et al., 2000)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>These early findings began to stimulate interest in such microbial repeat elements.</s><s>By 2002, Jansen and Mojica coined the acronym CRISPR to unify the description of microbial genomic loci consisting of an interspaced repeat array <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Jansen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barrangou and van der Oost, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, several clusters of signature CRISPR-associated (cas) genes were identified to be well conserved and typically adjacent to the repeat elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Jansen et al., 2002)</ref>, serving as a basis for the eventual classification of three different types of CRISPR systems (types I-III) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Haft et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Makarova et al., 2011b)</ref>.</s><s>Types I and III CRISPR loci contain multiple Cas proteins, now known to form complexes with crRNA (CASCADE complex for type I; Cmr or Csm RAMP complexes for type III) to facilitate the recognition and destruction of target nucleic acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brouns et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hale et al., 2009)</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the type II system has a significantly reduced number of Cas proteins.</s><s>However, despite increasingly detailed mapping and annotation of CRISPR loci across many microbial species, their biological significance remained elusive.</s></p><p><s>A key turning point came in 2005, when systematic analysis of the spacer sequences separating the individual direct repeats suggested their extrachromosomal and phageassociated origins <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mojica et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pourcel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bolotin et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>This insight was tremendously exciting, especially given previous studies showing that CRISPR loci are transcribed <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Tang et al., 2002)</ref> and that viruses are unable to infect archaeal cells carrying spacers corresponding to their own genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mojica et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Together, these findings led to the speculation that CRISPR arrays serve as an immune memory and defense mechanism, and individual spacers facilitate defense against bacteriophage infection by exploiting Watson-Crick base-pairing between nucleic acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mojica et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pourcel et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Despite these compelling realizations that CRISPR loci might be involved in microbial immunity, the specific mechanism of how the spacers act to mediate viral defense remained a challenging puzzle.</s><s>Several hypotheses were raised, including thoughts that CRISPR spacers act as small RNA guides to degrade viral transcripts in a RNAi-like mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Makarova et al., 2006)</ref> or that CRISPR spacers direct Cas enzymes to cleave viral DNA at spacer-matching regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bolotin et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Working with the dairy production bacterial strain Streptococcus thermophilus at the food ingredient company Danisco, Horvath and colleagues uncovered the first experimental evidence for the natural role of a type II CRISPR system as an adaptive immunity system, demonstrating a nucleic-acid-based immune system in which CRISPR spacers dictate target specificity while Cas enzymes control spacer acquisition and phage defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barrangou et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>A rapid series of studies illuminating the mechanisms of CRISPR defense followed shortly and helped to establish the mechanism as well as function of all three types of CRISPR loci inadaptive immunity.</s><s>By studying the type I CRISPR locus of Escherichia coli, van der Oost and colleagues showed that CRISPR arrays are transcribed and converted into small crRNAs containing individual spacers to guide Cas nuclease activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brouns et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In the same year, CRISPR-mediated defense by a type III-A CRISPR system from Staphylococcus epidermidis was demonstrated to block plasmid conjugation, establishing the target of Cas enzyme activity as DNA rather than RNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008)</ref>, although later investigation of a different type III-B system from Pyrococcus furiosus also revealed crRNA-directed RNA cleavage activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hale et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hale et al., , 2012))</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As the pace of CRISPR research accelerated, researchers quickly unraveled many details of each type of CRISPR system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Building on an earlier speculation that protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) may direct the type II Cas9 nuclease to cleave DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bolotin et al., 2005)</ref>, Moineau and colleagues highlighted the importance of PAM sequences by demonstrating that PAM mutations in phage genomes circumvented CRISPR interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Deveau et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, for types I and II, the lack of PAM within the direct repeat sequence within the CRISPR array prevents self-targeting by the CRISPR system.</s><s>In type III systems, however, mismatches between the 5′ end of the crRNA and the DNA target are required for plasmid interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>By 2010, just 3 years after the first experimental evidence for CRISPR in bacterial immunity, the basic function and mechanisms of CRISPR systems were becoming clear.</s><s>A variety of groups had begun to harness the natural CRISPR system for various biotechnological applications, including the generation of phage-resistant dairy cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Quiberoni et al., 2010)</ref> and phylogenetic classification of bacterial strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Horvath et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Horvath et al., , 2009))</ref>.</s><s>However, genome editing applications had not yet been explored.</s><s>Around this time, two studies characterizing the functional mechanisms of the native type II CRISPR system elucidated the basic components that proved vital for engineering a simple RNA-programmable DNA endonuclease for genome editing.</s><s>First, Moineau and colleagues used genetic studies in Streptococcus thermophilus to reveal that Cas9 (formerly called Cas5, Csn1, or Csx12) is the only enzyme within the cas gene cluster that mediates target DNA cleavage <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Garneau et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Next, Charpentier and colleagues revealed a key component in the biogenesis and processing of crRNA in type II CRISPR systems-a noncoding trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) that hybridizes with crRNA to facilitate RNA-guided targeting of Cas9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Deltcheva et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>This dual RNA hybrid, together with Cas9 and endogenous RNase III, is required for processing the CRISPR array transcript into mature crRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Deltcheva et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>These two studies suggested that there are at least three components (Cas9, the mature crRNA, and tracrRNA) that are essential for reconstituting the type II CRISPR nuclease system.</s><s>Given the increasing importance of programmable site-specific nucleases based on ZFs and TALEs for enhancing eukaryotic genome editing, it was tantalizing to think that perhaps Cas9 could be developed into an RNA-guided genome editing system.</s><s>From this point, the race to harness Cas9 for genome editing was on.</s></p><p><s>In 2011, Siksnys and colleagues first demonstrated that the type II CRISPR system is transferrable, in that transplantation of the type II CRISPR locus from Streptococcus thermophilus into Escherichia coli is able to reconstitute CRISPR interference in a different bacterial strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Sapranauskas et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>By 2012, biochemical characterizations by the groups of Charpentier, Doudna, and Siksnys showed that purified Cas9 from Streptococcus thermophilus or Streptococcus pyogenes can be guided by crRNAs to cleave target DNA in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jinek et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gasiunas et al., 2012)</ref>, in agreement with previous bacterial studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Garneau et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Deltcheva et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sapranauskas et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) can be constructed by fusing a crRNA containing the targeting guide sequence to a tracrRNA that facilitates DNA cleavage by Cas9 in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jinek et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In 2013, a pair of studies simultaneously showed how to successfully engineer type II CRISPR systems from Streptococcus thermophilus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cong et al., 2013)</ref> and Streptococcus pyogenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cong et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mali et al., 2013a)</ref> to accomplish genome editing in mammalian cells.</s><s>Heterologous expression of mature crRNA-tracrRNA hybrids <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cong et al., 2013)</ref> as well as sgRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cong et al.,

used to target several genes at once.</s><s>Since these initial studies, Cas9 has been used by thousands of laboratories for genome editing applications in a variety of experimental model systems <ref

Genome Editing Technologies Exploit Endogenous DNA Repair Machinery(A) DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are typically repaired by nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR).</s><s>In the error-prone NHEJ pathway, Ku heterodimers bind to DSB ends and serve as a molecular scaffold for associated repair proteins.</s><s>Indels are introduced when the complementary strands undergo end resection and misaligned repair due to micro-homology, eventually leading to frameshift mutations and gene knockout.</s><s>Alternatively, Rad51 proteins may bind DSB ends during the initial phase of HDR, recruiting accessory factors that direct genomic recombination with homology arms on an exogenous repair template.</s><s>Bypassing the matching sister chromatid facilitates the introduction of precise gene modifications.</s><s>(B) Zinc finger (ZF) proteins and transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are naturally occurring DNA-binding domains that can be modularly assembled to target specific sequences.</s><s>ZF and TALE domains each recognize 3 and 1 bp of DNA, respectively.</s><s>Such DNA-binding proteins can be fused to the FokI endonuclease to generate programmable site-specific nucleases.</s><s>(C) The Cas9 nuclease from the microbial CRISPR adaptive immune system is localized to specific DNA sequences via the guide sequence on its guide RNA (red), directly basepairing with the DNA target.</s><s>Binding of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, blue) downstream of the target locus helps to direct Cas9-mediated DSBs.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="28,171.03,62.00,329.94,261.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
