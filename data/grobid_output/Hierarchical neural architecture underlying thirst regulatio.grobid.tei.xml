restriction induces robust c-Fos expression in the SFO and putative downstream regions (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1a</ref>).</s><s>In the MnPO and OVLT, essentially all of

adeno-associated virus (AAV-DIO-ChR2) in nNOS-cre (also known as Nos1-cre) mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1a</ref>, bottom).</s><s>These data suggest that MnPO nNOS and OVLT nNOS neurons are putative downstream populations of SFO nNOS neurons.</s><s>Retrograde monosynaptic rabies tracing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> from MnPO nNOS and OVLT nNOS neurons confirmed direct connections with the SFO nNOS population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure"

the ablation of one population should have only minor effects on drinking.</s><s>Alternatively, if the circuit is organized in a hierarchical fashion in which a specific population has a critical role, the elimination of such a downstream population should abolish SFO nNOS -stimulated drinking.</s><s>To test these ideas, we expressed caspase (AAV-flex-Casp3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> in the MnPO, OVLT or SFO of nNOS-cre mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1c</ref>).</s><s>The expression of Casp3 resulted in the specific and near-complete elimination of nNOS-expressing neurons of a given nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a</ref>).</s><s>In OVLT nNOS -ablated and control mice, photostimulation of SFO nNOS neurons triggered robust drinking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1e</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b</ref>).</s><s>By sharp contrast, the ablation of MnPO nNOS neurons markedly suppressed SFO nNOS-stimulated water intake (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1e</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b</ref>, MnPOx).</s><s>We also found that MnPO nNOS neurons have an important role in the drinking behaviour evoked by OVLT nNOS neurons.</s><s>Water intake induced by photostimulation of OVLT nNOS neurons was significantly attenuated after ablating MnPO nNOS , but not SFO nNOS neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2c</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that MnPO nNOS neurons are essential neural substrates of the lamina terminalis for the behavioural output.</s><s>If this model is correct, stimulating the MnPO nNOS population without the inputs from their upstream SFO nNOS , or both SFO nNOS and OVLT nNOS , neurons should still trigger robust drinking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1c</ref>).</s><s>As hypothesized, the elimination of these populations had no impact on drinking when MnPO nNOS neurons were directly photostimulated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1e</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b</ref>, SFOx, SFOx and OVLTx).</s><s>Similar results were obtained by chemogenetic acute silencing using hM4Di (ref.</s><s>30) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1f</ref>).</s><s>In awake mice, acute inhibition of MnPO nNOS neurons by clozapine N-oxide (CNO) severely suppressed water consumption in both

in MnPO nNOS neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1h</ref>).</s><s>We showed that the activation of SFO nNOS neurons by osmotic stress was unaffected in the absence of functioning MnPO nNOS neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1i</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2f</ref>).</s><s>These results were supported by our electrophysiological recordings: only a minor fraction of SFO neurons received monosynaptic input from MnPO nNOS neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>), demonstrating the unidirectional connection from SFO nNOS to MnPO nNOS neurons.</s><s>Taken together, our results demonstrate that thirst neurons in the lamina terminalis form a hierarchical circuit organization, and that the MnPO nNOS population is required to process signals from SFO nNOS neurons to coordinate drinking.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of eating and drinking</head><p><s>We investigated the mechanisms by which MnPO GLP1R neurons exclusively represent fluid intake.</s><s>To this end, we provided water-restricted mice with water in two different formsliquid and gel (HydroGel: 98% water + hydrocolloids)-while recording MnPO GLP1R activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4a</ref>).</s><s>In either form, the mice ingested a similar amount of water within the 30min session (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4b</ref>).</s><s>Notably, compared to the robust activation of MnPO GLP1R neurons upon drinking water, gel-eating behaviour did not elicit any response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, eating normal chow did not stimulate this neural population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4d</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, MnPO GLP1R neurons are able to distinguish between drinking and eating behaviour even if an animal consumes essentially the same substance.</s><s>These results suggest that the MnPO GLP1R population facilitates satiety, which is induced by drinking behavior and not specifically by water.</s></p><p><s>Because the rate of ingestion differed considerably between the drinking of water and the eating of HydroGel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4b</ref>), we speculated that MnPO GLP1R neurons may monitor the pattern of ingestion in order to distinguish the mode of consumption.</s><s>To examine this possibility, mice were given access to water for 30 s in total at two different rates: 2 s × 15 times and 30 s × 1 time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4e</ref>).</s><s>As hypothesized, concentrated periods of drinking evoked significantly greater responses in the MnPO GLP1R neurons than did sparse periods of drinking, regardless of the total amount of water consumed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4e</ref>).</s><s>We note that the temperature of the fluid did not affect the response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4f</ref>).</s><s>Because animals can ingest fluids much faster than they can ingest solid substances, these data strongly support the idea that the MnPO GLP1R population distinguishes between drinking and eating on the basis of ingestion speed.</s><s>Consequently, concentrated (that is, rapid) fluid intake recruits MnPO GLP1R -mediated inhibition signals, which in turn suppress the activity of SFO nNOS neurons.</s><s>These findings provide key mechanistic insight into rapid thirst alleviation as a result of drinking behaviour.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MnPO GLP1R neurons help thirst satiety</head><p><s>In view of the function of the MnPO GLP1R population in the monitoring of fluid intake, we next considered its physiological importance in the regulation of drinking using chemogenetic loss-of-function manipulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a</ref>).</s><s>Whereas any fluid elicits transient MnPO GLP1R → SFO nNOS inhibition, water evokes an additional inhibitory effect that persists after drinking episodes (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>).</s><s>Owing to this water-specific signal, inhibition of MnPO GLP1R neurons by CNO had only a minor effect on the total water intake of water-restricted mice during a 30-minute period (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, marked effects were observed for isotonic saline, in which MnPO GLP1Rindependent inhibitory signals are absent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5b</ref>).</s><s>Compared to the vehicle control, inhibition of MnPO GLP1R neurons robustly increased both the total amount and the duration of saline intake (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8c</ref>).</s><s>However, under satiated conditions, the same manipulation did not increase water or saline intake, which excludes the possibility that inhibiting MnPO GLP1R neurons stimulates appetite directly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5c</ref>).</s><s>We observed the same overdrinking phenotype in mice in which MnPO GLP1R neurons were ablated by Casp3 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Our functional manipulation studies demonstrate that MnPO GLP1R neurons promote satiety of thirst by monitoring real-time fluid intake, and that the malfunction of this neuronal regulation leads to polydipsic overdrinking, especially in the case of non-hypoosmotic fluids such as saline.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we identified genetically defined thirst circuits in the lamina terminalis that integrate the instinctive need for water with the consequent drinking behaviour to maintain internal water balance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5d</ref>).</s><s>We showed that multiple downstream populations of SFO nNOS neurons are individually sufficient to induce water intake.</s><s>These data are reminiscent of the circuit organization for hunger, in which eating behaviour is redundantly encoded by multiple output projections of AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>However, we showed that individual thirst-related neuronal populations of the lamina terminalis are hierarchically organized, and that MnPO nNOS neurons are the behavioural output neurons.</s><s>Previous lesion studies in rats and sheep have proposed a model in which the MnPO serves as a critical site that integrates inputs from osmosensory neurons of the SFO and the OVLT <ref type="bibr">36 -38</ref> .</s><s>Our findings well explain and further advance the concept of this model with cell-type-specific precision.</s><s>Whereas the necessity of the SFO may vary among species <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , the MnPO appears to consistently function as the key centre for drinking across species <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>In our analysis, MnPO nNOS neurons project to various areas including the hypothalamus and the midbrain (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>; see also ref. 18).</s><s>These results reveal a neural logic to thirst processing in the lamina terminalis circuit, and provide a platform for investigation into how the appetite for water is integrated at downstream sites of MnPO nNOS neurons.</s></p><p><s>Notably, MnPO GLP1R neurons responded selectively to the ingestion of fluids but not solids.</s><s>These inhibitory neurons provide rapid monosynaptic inhibition to thirst-driving SFO nNOS neurons.</s><s>Our results indicate strongly that the MnPO GLP1R population facilitates thirst satiation upon drinking rather than upon water absorption.</s><s>At a psychophysical level, these findings provide an explanation for the long-standing observation that thirst is quickly alleviated at the onset of drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>At a physiological level, these results reveal a neural interface that adjusts the activity of thirst neurons on the basis of real-time drinking behaviour.</s><s>Although systemic recovery of fluid balance relies on water absorption into the blood, thirst is modulated by multiple preabsorptive factors including oral, oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>It is unlikely that the MnPO GLP1R → SFO nNOS circuit mediates oral sensory information such as taste <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> because it responds to any fluid, including silicone oil.</s><s>Instead, MnPO GLP1R neurons may function as a flow-meter by sensing gulping actions in the oropharyngeal area, and provide rapid, liquid-specific inhibition to thirst circuits.</s><s>This idea is consistent with previous findings that drinking hyperosmotic saline <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , but not eating food <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> , transiently suppressed vasopressin secretion.</s><s>In this model, MnPO <ref type="bibr">GLP1R</ref> neurons serve as a central detector that discriminates fluid ingestion from solid ingestion, which promotes acute satiation of thirst through the SFO and other downstream targets (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>).</s><s>Subsequently, gastrointestinal mechanisms may selectively detect water over other fluids that induce persistent inhibitory effects on SFO nNOS neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>).</s><s>Although fluid-sensing mechanisms at each peripheral area are poorly understood, further molecular and cellular studies should help to reveal complex regulatory signals that maintain body-fluid homeostasis.</s></p></div>
