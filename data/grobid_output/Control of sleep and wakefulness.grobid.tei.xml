INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The purpose of sleep is one of the great unsolved mysteries of biology and has fascinated people for millennia.</s><s>Although the function or functions of sleep are still unresolved, great progress has been made in understanding the brain mechanisms that control sleep and wakefulness.</s><s>An understanding of these mechanisms is of paramount importance to our society.</s><s>Sleeping tablets are among the most widely prescribed medicines, and disturbances in sleep are associated with a wide range of medical and psychiatric conditions.</s><s>Conversely, an increase in sleep is one important mechanism that the body uses to combat infection and maintain optimal health.</s><s>Adequate sleep is also essential for optimal cognitive function; lack of sleep has been implicated in major industrial disasters as well as car and workplace accidents.</s><s>In this unusually comprehensive review we summarize current knowledge regarding the brain mechanisms which control wakefulness, non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Characteristics of Sleep-Wake States</head><p><s>Sleep is defined in the sleep laboratory, in both humans and animals, by recording the electrical field activity of large groups of cortical neurons and muscle cells.</s><s>Thus scalp electrodes record the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrodes placed on or in skeletal muscles record the electromyogram (EMG), whereas electrodes placed over or near the muscles responsible for horizontal eye movement record the electro-oculogram (EOG).</s><s>Deep brain electrodes are used to record the activity of individual brain areas or individual neurons.</s><s>These so-called polysomnographic recordings are used to define the states of wakefulness and sleep as follows (FIGURE <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>): wakefulness is defined by low-voltage fast EEG activity (LVFA) and high muscle tone, NREM sleep is characterized by highamplitude low-frequency EEG and decreased muscle tone, whereas REM sleep has LVFA coupled with a complete loss of muscle tone (REM muscle atonia) and characteristic rapid eye movements which contrast with the slow rolling eye movements observed during NREM.</s><s>Further characteristics of these three states and the brain circuitry which generates them are discussed in sections II-IV.</s><s>A summary of studies involving inactivation of different parts of the brain controlling sleep and wake is provided in TABLE <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>The location of these brain regions is shown in FIGURE <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>The past century witnessed an enormous explosion in our knowledge of the brain mechanisms that control wakefulness and sleep.</s><s>Ethological and genetic studies have revealed the presence of NREM sleep-like states even in invertebrates such as Drosophila and have revealed that homologous genes/proteins control rest/sleep in flies, fish, mice, and humans.</s><s>Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems making up the ARAS arouse the brain and produce wakefulness in response to physiological challenges as diverse as increases in blood CO 2 decreases in ambient temperature, and the presence of rewarding stimuli.</s><s>Increases in arousal are observed as an increase in low-amplitude fast EEG rhythms important for synchronization of neuronal assemblies involved in attention, working memory, and conscious awareness.</s><s>Conversely, NREM sleep is associated with highamplitude slow waves produced by the combination of a circadian inhibition of ARAS neurons mediated by GABAergic neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus and basal forebrain and by the action of a plethora of homeostatic sleep factors acting locally in the cortex or basal forebrain.</s><s>Multiple interacting lines of evidence support a role for NREM sleep in the control of energy metabolism and synaptic plasticity/memory formation.</s><s>REM sleep is induced by the increased firing of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons in the dorsolateral pons, resulting in muscle atonia coupled with both tonic and phasic activation of the cortex.</s><s>Phasic activation of visual cortex and limbic regions during REM sleep, coupled with deactivation of prefrontal cortex, is responsible for the bizarre imagery of dreams and may reflect a role for REM sleep in emotional regulation and/or memory consolidation in the adult or establishment of neural circuitry in the developing animal.</s><s>Sleep deprivation leads to an inhibition of arousal mechanisms at subcortical and cortical sites, leading to impairments in cognitive function, which in turn can result in accidents at home and in the workplace.</s><s>Deficits in arousal mechanisms and highfrequency rhythms are observed in sleep disorders and conditions such as coma, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy.</s><s>Consistent with a role for sleep in energy metabolism, sleep deprivation is a major contributor to metabolic syndrome, a leading public health issue.</s><s>Furthermore, dysregulation of sleep is a feature of depression, PTSD, and a variety of sleep disorders related to muscle control.</s><s>Thus studies of the mechanisms controlling sleep and wakefulness can reasonably be expected to lay the groundwork for therapies to treat a multitude of afflictions affecting mankind.</s><s>Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in the human and rat capture differences between vigilance states (wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep).</s><s>Wakefulness in both species is characterized by low-amplitude/high-frequency activity.</s><s>Note that high-frequency beta and gamma activity is not easily visible at this slow timescale.</s><s>In the human, NREM sleep begins in stage 1, the prevalent EEG frequency begins to slow, with strong alpha activity at posterior sites and theta activity at anterior sites.</s><s>In NREM sleep stages 2/3, both sleep spindles (7-14 Hz) and K-complexes are seen, as the EEG amplitude increases and frequency further slows.</s><s>In NREM sleep stage 4, also known as slow wave sleep, strong delta (0.5-4 Hz) activity is evident, accompanied by a large increase in amplitude.</s><s>During REM sleep, the EEG returns to a profile similar to wakefulness, with low-amplitude and high-frequency activity.</s><s>In the rodent, NREM sleep is usually not parsed into separate stages.</s><s>NREM sleep exhibits a significant increase of delta range activity, as well as an increase in amplitude.</s><s>REM sleep is defined by the strong synchronous theta range    A simplified structural model of hippocampal theta rhythm control.</s><s>Tonic neuronal activity of the reticular formation, largely originating in the nucleus pontine oralis (PnO), excites the supramammillary nucleus (SUM) by means of glutamatergic projections.</s><s>Pontine tonic activity is converted to rhythmic firing in SUM, indicated by the wave symbol.</s><s>Glutamatergic SUM output then excites GABAergic and cholinergic neurons of the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band (MS/vDB), which serves as the pacemaker of the hippocampal theta rhythm.</s><s>Dorsal and ventral pathways of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS).</s><s>The dorsal pathway (blue) originates in pontine and midbrain reticular formation, most prominently cholinergic (LDT/PPT) and glutamatergic neurons which project to the "nonspecific" intralaminar and midline thalamic nuclei which diffusely innervate many areas of the cerebral cortex as well as thalamic relay neurons with more selective projections patterns.</s><s>The ventral pathway also originates in pontine/midbrain regions and projects to the lateral hypothalamic (LH) and tuberomammillary (TMN) nuclei of the hypothalamus, as well as the basal forebrain (BF).</s><s>Output of LH and TMN also ascend to BF, which in turn projects to the cortex.</s><s>Noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe (DR) contribute to both pathways and send direct projections to the cortex as do histamine neurons of the TMN and orexinergic neurons in the LH.</s><s>LDT, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus; PPT, pedunculopontine nucleus.</s><s>[Adapted from <ref type="bibr">Paxinos and Watson (989)</ref>, with permission from

As REM sleep progresses, REM-on cells begin to excite REM-off cells, leading to REM sleep cessation. Dorsal raphe (DR) and locus coeruleus (LC) REM-off neurons inhibit laterodorsal/ pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT/PPT) REM-on neurons during waking and NREM sleep. Self-inhibition of these REM-off neurons leads to disinhibition of REM-on neurons, again allowing REM sleep. Adapted from McCarley</note>
