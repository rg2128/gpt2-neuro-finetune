<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>tuberculosis is known to be influenced by the environmental factors, such as stress, malnutrition, concomitant infections (HIV) or senescence 6,7 .</s><s>While genetic variation within host populations is also known to play a role in resistance and susceptibility, individual genes responsible for innate immunity to the pathogen have been elusive.</s><s>In susceptible individuals, progression of lung tuberculosis often leads to formation of characteristic necrotic 'cavities' that destroy significant portions of the lung.</s><s>Beyond their life-threatening clinical consequences, these lesions are essential for efficient transmission of MTB via aerosol.</s><s>Since in humans tuberculosis is transmitted primarily via the respiratory route, the ability to cause lung disease is considered a key aspect of the pathogen's virulence strategy, which ensures its evolutionary success.</s><s>Therefore, understanding pathogenic mechanisms that are employed by virulent MTB during lung tuberculosis in susceptible individuals is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies 8,9 .</s><s>However, detailed mechanistic studies of pathogenesis of lung tuberculosis and its genetic control have been limited by the fact that in mouse models of MTB infection, necrotic lesions in the lungs are rarely found unless the mouse is rendered systemically immunodeficient.</s></p><p><s>C3HeB/FeJ inbred mice are extremely susceptible to MTB and develop dramatic lung pathology, which leads to their rapid death after infection with virulent MTB 10,11 .</s><s>We generated a congenic mouse strain C3H.B6-sst1 (sst1 R ) that carries the C57BL/6J-derived resistant allele at the sst1 locus on the C3HeB/FeJ genetic background.</s><s>The survival time of the sst1 R congenic mice infected either intravenously (i.v.) with a high dose of MTB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), or with a low dose of MTB via respiratory route (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), relative to their sst1 S counterparts is significantly lengthened, indicating a profound effect of the locus on anti-tuberculosis immunity.</s><s>However, the shorter survival of the C3H.B6-sst1 (sst1 R ) mice, as compared to the resistant parental strain C57BL/6J (B6), clearly indicates that the sst1 locus is responsible for a significant portion, but not the whole, of the tuberculosis resistance phenotype of the B6 mice.</s></p><p><s>The specific effect of the sst1 locus on progression of tuberculosis was related to more efficient control of MTB multiplication primarily in the lungs after both respiratory challenge by aerosolized MTB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), and systemic i.v.</s><s>infection (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>The development of large necrotic lung lesions within 4 weeks after i.v.</s><s>infection characteristic of sst1 S mice was prevented in the presence of the sst1 R allele (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>After a low dose aerosol infection, chronic tuberculosis infection ensued, and the sst1 S mice developed encapsulated necrotic lung lesions, in some cases reaching approximately one third of the lung lobe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>), which resembled tuberculosis cavities in human lungs.</s><s>Mycobacteria were present both extracellularly within necrotic central areas surrounded by the fibrotic capsule as well as within macrophages of the granuloma wall (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In the sst1 R mice, lung lesions were much smaller and contained fewer macrophages infected with MTB.</s></p><p><s>Although the most dramatic effect of the sst1 polymorphism on progression of tuberculosis was observed in the lungs; bone marrow transplantation experiments demonstrated that bone marrow-derived, but not lung cells, were responsible for the effect of the sst1 locus (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>It is known that T lymphocytes and macrophages play a major role in host resistance to tuberculosis.</s><s>We have found that, while T lymphocytes are functionally unaffected by the sst1 polymorphism (Jobe, in preparation), the sst1 disparate macrophages display considerable differences in their ability to control MTB in vitro.</s><s>The rate of MTB multiplication was significantly higher in the sst1 S macrophages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>, left panel).</s><s>There was also a clear distinction in mechanism of macrophage cell death after the infection: the sst1 S macrophages showed characteristic necrosis, while the sst1 R macrophages underwent apoptosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>, upper left and upper right panels, respectively).</s><s>The effect of the sst1 locus was much more pronounced upon macrophage infection with virulent MTB, since avirulent vaccine strain of M. bovis BCG failed to multiply in (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>, right panel) and to induce necrosis of the sst1 S macrophages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>, lower left panel).</s></p><p><s>In vivo, many cells within the tuberculosis lung granulomas of the sst1 R mice contained TUNEL-positive apoptotic nuclei and no necrosis was observed, while the apoptotic nuclei were largely absent from the necrotic lesions of the sst1 S mice (see Supplementary Note).</s><s>Thus our studies, both in vivo and in vitro, indicated that the extreme susceptibility to virulent MTB of sst1 S mice was associated with necrotic death of the susceptible macrophages.</s><s>Virulent MTB was shown to cause necrosis of the infected epithelial cell lines 12 .</s><s>This necrosis-inducing propensity is specific for virulent MTB and is lost in RD1 mutants of MTB that have also dramatically decreased virulence 12,13 .</s><s>It appears from our studies that, in addition to virulence determinants of the pathogen itself, mechanisms of host cell death depend on the host polymorphic gene(s) encoded within the sst1 locus.</s></p><p><s>To identify the critical gene(s), we employed a positional cloning strategy (see Supplementary Data and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for details).</s><s>First, the sst1 minimal region was reduced to an interval between D1Mit439 and D1Mit49 markers on mouse chromosome 1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>This region contains a so-called HSR (for homogeneously stained region) repeat (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>The HSR repeat region is, arguably, the largest repetitive region in the mouse genome 14,15 .</s><s>Its size in inbred mouse strains, is estimated to be between 3.5 and 6 Mb 15,16 and it remains unfinished by both mouse genome projects.</s><s>After identifying and testing progeny of additional recombinants within this interval (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), we concluded that the sst1 candidate region encompasses part of the HSR repeat region and a region of mouse chromosome 1 immediately downstream of the repeat, i.e. between the repeat region and the NppC gene.</s><s>A total of 22 known and predicted genes are encoded within the sst1 critical region according to Ensembl and Celera databases of the mouse genome (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>It was impossible further to reduce the sst1 critical region by genetic recombination.</s><s>Therefore, in the next step we tested expression of each of the sst1-encoded candidate genes in the lungs during tuberculosis infection in vivo and in macrophages infected with MTB in vitro using RT-PCR and RACE.</s><s>The Ifi75 gene appeared from our studies as the most likely candidate (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> and<ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, the 5' RACE products of the Ifi75 in the lungs of tuberculosis-infected mice was strikingly different between the sst1 congenic strains: a major single band was amplified from the lungs of the sst1 resistant mice, whereas this band was absent from the lungs of the sst1 susceptible strain and, instead, multiple weak products were obtained.</s><s>Although some aberrant transcripts were present in the lung tissue of the sst1 R animals as well, the majority of the Ifi75-related transcripts in their tuberculosis lung lesions were represented by a single isoform, which we named as Ipr1 (for intracellular pathogen resistance) to differentiate it from other Ifi75-related sequences (Ifi75-rs) identified by RACE and, perhaps, also encoded within the HSR repeat.</s><s>The predicted Ipr1 protein is 92% identical to the Mus caroli Ifi75.</s><s>It contains an Sp100-like domain in its N-terminus, LXXLL-type nuclear receptor binding motif (NRB), bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), and a SAND domain in its C-terminus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Using DNA probes specific for the Sp100 and SAND domains of the Ipr1, we have analyzed the kinetics of its expression by Northern hybridization in the lungs of the sst1 congenic mouse strains during progression of tuberculosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>Expression of the Ipr1 gene was detectable in the lungs of the naive sst1 R mice, and its expression increased significantly 2 weeks after intravenous infection with MTB and remained at elevated levels at later time points.</s><s>However, expression of the Sp100 and SAND domain-containing Ifi75-rs in the lungs of the sst1 susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mice remained below the level of detection by Northern blot hybridization.</s><s>Instead, the level of transcripts of another gene encoded within the HSR repeat region, Sp100-rs, was elevated in the lungs of the sst1 S mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To investigate expression of the Ipr1 gene in macrophages, we used five overlapping combinations of the Ipr1-specific PCR primers that cover the full length Ipr1 transcript (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>The Ipr1 gene was expressed in non-activated sst1 R macrophages and the level of its expression increased after infection with both avirulent BCG and virulent MTB.</s><s>No expression of the full length transcript of the Ipr1 gene was seen in the sst1 S macrophages under any stimulation conditions.</s><s>Macrophages isolated from the tuberculosis lung lesions of the sst1 R mice also expressed the full length Ipr1 transcript, while those from the sst1 S mice did not (data not shown).</s><s>We were unable to detect additional Ipr1-related transcripts induced in macrophages upon infection in vivo and in vitro or stimulation with IFN-γ.</s><s>Despite the fact that the Ipr1 gene is encoded within the HSR repeat region, our data suggest that a single major isoform of this gene is expressed in sst1 R macrophages either before or during tuberculosis infection and this isoform is not expressed in the sst1 S C3HeB/FeJ mice.</s></p><p><s>The C3HeB/FeJ substrain is unique among all other substrains of C3H mice in terms of its extreme susceptibility to tuberculosis 10,11 .</s><s>The C3HeB/FeJ mice die abruptly within 3.5-4 weeks after the infection displaying severe lung pathology.</s><s>In our experiments, the survival time of other substrains of C3H was considerably longer and similar to the sst1 R congenic strain C3H.B6-sst1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>The bacterial loads in the lungs of the C3HeB/FeJ mice at 3 weeks post infection were 50 to 100 fold higher as compared to other substrains of C3H and the sst1 R congenics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), suggesting a unique allele at the sst1 locus.</s><s>We compared expression of the sst1-encoded candidate genes in the lungs of mice of four C3H substrains and the sst1 R congenics and found that the lack of expression of the Ipr1 gene differentiated the C3HeB/ FeJ from all other substrains of C3H (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Since all the C3H substrains originate from a common ancestor 17 , it is likely that they are genetically identical within the sst1 region and a unique de novo mutation has led to the defect of the Ipr1 gene expression in a C3HeB/FeJ mice and is responsible for a severe defect in their tuberculosis resistance.</s></p><p><s>We generated transgenic mice that expressed a full length copy of the Ipr1 cDNA on the susceptible C3HeB/FeJ background in a macrophage-specific manner under control of the human scavenger receptor A promoter (SR-A).</s><s>Mature bone marrow-derived macrophages, as well as resident peritoneal macrophages obtained from those mice, expressed the Ipr1 transgene (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>Despite the fact that the regulation of Ipr1 gene expression in the transgenic macrophages was clearly less efficient from the SR-A promoter than from the endogenous Ipr1 promoter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>), when the Ipr1 transgenic mice were infected with virulent MTB, a statistically significant difference in the bacterial loads between the sst1 S (Tg -/-) and the Ipr1 transgenic (Tg +/-) animals was observed in the lungs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>In vitro, the Ipr1 transgenic macrophages also controlled multiplication of MTB more effectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>) and turned on the apoptotic pathway of cell death upon interaction with virulent MTB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, right panels).</s><s>The growth of another intracellular pathogen, L. monocytogenes, was dramatically suppressed in the Ipr1 transgenic macrophages by 50 to 100 fold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>).</s><s>Similar to the MTB infection, necrotic death accompanied infection of the sst1 S macrophages with virulent L. monocytogenes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>, left panel), while the Ipr1 transgenic macrophages displayed markers of apoptotic death (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>, right panel).</s></p><p><s>Thus expression of a single gene, Ipr1, in the sst1 S macrophages restored key functions related to pathogenesis of tuberculosis, which are encoded within the sst1 locus: greater control of multiplication of virulent MTB in vivo and in vitro as well as an apoptotic mechanism of MTBinduced macrophage cell death.</s><s>Moreover, the Ipr1 gene mediated macrophage resistance to another intracellular pathogen, L. monocytogenes, suggesting that the Ipr1 product controls a common mechanism of innate resistance against several intracellular pathogens.</s></p><p><s>The closest homologue of the predicted Ipr1 protein in humans (41% of identity) is SP110b 18 , which localizes to a region of human chromosome 2 sythenic with the sst1 minimal region on mouse chromosome 1.</s><s>Both the Ipr1 and the human SP110 proteins contain motifs that are involved in protein-protein interactions (Sp100 domain) 19,20 , chromatin binding (SAND domain) 21,22 , nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the nuclear receptor binding (NRB) motif LXXLL.</s><s>Recent evidence suggests that human SP110 protein, may function as a nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional cofactor 18 and directly bind the retinoic acid receptor 23 .</s><s>Signaling through nuclear receptors, such as the corticosteroid receptor, retinoic acid receptor, PPARs and vitamin D plays an important role in control of various aspects of the macrophage life cycle, including differentiation, activation, response to pathogens and apoptosis 24 .</s><s>Expression of both the Ipr1 gene and its human homologue SP110, is regulated by interferons 25 , additionally implicating a role in immunity in both species.</s><s>Moreover, polymorphisms in SP110 gene have been associated with susceptibility to the Hepatitis C virus 26 , and the SP110b protein has been shown to physically interact with viral proteins, such as Epstein-Barr virus SM protein and Hepatitis C virus core protein 23,27 .</s><s>It is an intriguing possibility that the Ipr1 and SP110 proteins mediate cross talk between nuclear receptors, interferon signaling and pathogens.</s><s>The viruses and, perhaps, intracellular pathogens might have evolved mechanisms to interfere with or exploit the Ipr1/SP110 function.</s><s>Taken together, these data suggest that in mammals, since no Ipr1 homologues were found in yeasts or insects, the Ipr1-related proteins may play a novel role in integrating signals generated by intracellular pathogens or viruses with mechanisms regulating activation, gene expression and cell death of host cells 28 .</s><s>Therefore, the SP110 may be an excellent candidate gene for testing for association with susceptibility to tuberculosis in human populations.</s></p></div>
