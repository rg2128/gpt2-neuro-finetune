<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Individual cells are the building blocks of tissues, organs, and organisms.</s><s>Each tissue contains cells of many types, and cells of each type can switch among biological states.</s><s>In most biological systems, our knowledge of cellular diversity is incomplete; for example, the cell-type complexity of the brain is unknown and widely debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Luo et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>To understand how complex tissues work, it will be important to learn the functional capacities and responses of each cell type.</s></p><p><s>A major determinant of each cell's function is its transcriptional program.</s><s>Recent advances now enable mRNA-seq analysis of individual cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tang et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>However, methods of preparing cells for profiling have been applicable in practice to just hundreds <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hashimshony et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Picelli et al., 2013)</ref> or (with automation) a few thousand cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jaitin et al., 2014)</ref>, typically after first separating the cells by flow sorting <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Shalek et al., 2013)</ref> or microfluidics <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shalek et al., 2014)</ref> and then amplifying each cell's transcriptome separately.</s><s>Fast, scalable approaches are needed to characterize complex tissues with many cell types and states, under diverse conditions and perturbations.</s></p><p><s>Here we describe Drop-Seq, a method to analyze mRNA expression in thousands of individual cells by encapsulating cells in tiny droplets for parallel analysis.</s><s>Dropletsnanoliter-scale aqueous compartments formed by precisely combining aqueous and oil flows in a microfluidic device <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Thorsen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Umbanhowar, 2000)</ref> -have been used as tiny reaction chambers for PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hindson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1999)</ref> and reverse transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beer et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>We sought here to use droplets to compartmentalize cells into nanoliter-sized reaction chambers for analysis of all of their RNAs.</s><s>A basic challenge of using droplets for transcriptomics is to retain a molecular memory of the identity of the cell from which each mRNA transcript was isolated.</s><s>To accomplish this, we developed a molecular barcoding strategy to remember the cell-of-origin of each mRNA.</s><s>We critically evaluate Drop-Seq, then use it to profile cell states along the cell cycle.</s><s>We then applied it to a complex neural tissue, mouse retina, and from 44,808 cell profiles retrieved 39 distinct populations, each corresponding to one or a group of closely related cell types.</s><s>Our results demonstrate how large-scale single-cell analysis can help deepen our understanding of the biology of complex tissues and cell populations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Drop-Seq consists of the following steps (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>): (1) prepare a single-cell suspension from a tissue; (2) co-encapsulate each cell with a distinctly barcoded microparticle (bead) in a nanoliter-scale droplet; (3) lyse cells after they have been isolated in droplets; (4) capture a cell's mRNAs on its companion microparticle, forming STAMPs (Single-cell Transcriptomes Attached to Microparticles); (5) reverse-transcribe, amplify, and sequence thousands of STAMPs in one reaction; and (6) use the STAMP barcodes to infer each transcript's cell of origin.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A split-pool synthesis approach to generate large numbers of distinctly barcoded beads</head><p><s>To deliver large numbers of distinctly barcoded primer molecules into individual droplets, we use microparticles (beads).</s><s>We synthesized oligonucleotide primers directly on beads (from 5' to 3', yielding free 3' ends available for enzymatic priming).</s><s>Each oligonucleotide is composed of four parts (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>): (1) a constant sequence (identical on all primers and beads) for use as a priming site for downstream PCR and sequencing; (2) a "cell barcode" (identical across all the primers on the surface of any one bead, but different from the cell barcodes on other beads); (3) a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) (different on each primer, to identify PCR duplicates) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kivioja et al., 2012)</ref>; and (4) an oligo-dT sequence for capturing polyadenylated mRNAs and priming reverse transcription.</s></p><p><s>To efficiently generate massive numbers of beads, each with a distinct barcode, we developed a "split-and-pool" DNA synthesis strategy (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>A pool of millions of microparticles is divided into four equally sized groups; a different DNA base (A, G, C, or T) is then added to each.</s><s>All microparticles are then re-pooled, mixed, and re-split at random into another four groups, and then a different DNA base (A, G, C, or T) is added to each of the four new groups.</s><s>After 12 cycles of split-and-pool DNA synthesis, the primers on any given microparticle possess the same one of 4 12 = 16,777,216 possible 12-bp barcodes, but different microparticles have different sequences (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>The entire microparticle pool then undergoes eight rounds of degenerate oligonucleotide synthesis to generate the UMI on each oligo (Figure <ref type="figure">1D</ref>); finally, an oligo-dT sequence (T30) is synthesized on the 3' end of all oligos on all beads.</s></p><p><s>To confirm that we could distinguish RNAs based on attached barcodes, we reversetranscribed a pool of synthetic RNAs onto 11 microparticles and sequenced the resulting cDNAs (Figure <ref type="figure">S1A</ref> and Extended Experimental Procedures); 11 microparticle barcodes each constituted 3.5% -14% of the resulting sequencing reads, whereas the next-mostabundant 12-mer constituted only 0.06% (Figure <ref type="figure">S1A</ref>).</s><s>These results suggested that the microparticle-of-origin for most cDNAs can be recognized by sequencing.</s><s>We also found that each bead contained more than 10 8 barcoded primer sites and that the sequence complexity of the barcodes approached theoretical limits <ref type="bibr">(Figures S1B and S1C,</ref><ref type="bibr">Extended Experimental Procedures)</ref>.</s></p></div>

its mRNAs bind to the primers on its companion microparticle.</s><s>The mRNAs are reverse-transcribed into cDNAs, generating a set of beads called "single-cell transcriptomes attached to microparticles" (STAMPs).</s><s>The barcoded STAMPs can then be amplified in pools for high-throughput mRNA-seq to analyze any desired number of individual cells.</s><s>(B) Sequence of primers on the microparticle.</s><s>The primers on all beads contain a common sequence ("PCR handle") to enable PCR amplification after STAMP formation.</s><s>Each microparticle contains more than 10 8 individual primers that share the same "cell barcode" (panel C) but have different unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), enabling mRNA transcripts to be digitally counted (panel D).</s><s>A 30 bp oligo dT sequence is present at the end of all primer sequences for capture of mRNAs.</s><s>(C) Split-and-pool synthesis of the cell barcode.</s><s>To generate the cell barcode, the pool of microparticles is repeatedly split into four equally sized oligonucleotide synthesis reactions, to which one of the four DNA bases is added, and then pooled together after each cycle, in a total of 12 split-pool cycles.</s><s>The barcode synthesized on any individual bead reflects that bead's unique path through the series of synthesis reactions.</s><s>The result is a pool of microparticles, each possessing one of 4 12 (16,777,216) possible sequences on its entire complement of primers (see also Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>(D) Synthesis of a unique molecular identifier (UMI).</s><s>Following the completion of the "split-and-pool" synthesis cycles, all microparticles are together subjected to eight rounds of degenerate synthesis with all four DNA bases available during each cycle, such that each individual primer receives one of 4 8 (65,536) possible sequences (UMIs).</s><s>A customdesigned microfluidic device joins two aqueous flows before their compartmentalization into discrete droplets.</s><s>One flow contains cells, and the other flow contains barcoded primer beads suspended in a lysis buffer.</s><s>Immediately following droplet formation, the cell is lysed and releases its mRNAs, which then hybridize to the primers on the microparticle surface.</s><s>The droplets are broken by adding a reagent to destabilize the oil-water interface (Experimental Procedures), and the microparticles collected and washed.</s><s>The mRNAs are then reverse-transcribed in bulk, forming STAMPs, and template switching is used to introduce a PCR handle downstream of the synthesized cDNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zhu et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>(B) Microfluidic device used in Drop-Seq.</s><s>Beads (brown in image), suspended in a lysis agent, enter the device from the central channel; cells enter from the top and bottom.</s><s>Laminar flow prevents mixing of the two aqueous inputs prior to droplet formation (see also Movie S1).</s><s>Schematics of the device design and how it is operated can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>(C) Molecular elements of a Drop-Seq sequencing library.</s><s>The first read yields the cell barcode and UMI.</s><s>The second, paired read interrogates sequence from the cDNA (50 bp is typically sequenced); this sequence is then aligned to the genome to determine a transcript's gene of origin.</s><s>(D) In silicoreconstruction of thousands of single-cell transcriptomes.</s><s>Millions of pairedend reads are generated from a Drop-Seq library on a high-throughput sequencer.</s><s>The reads are first aligned to a reference genome to identify the gene-of-origin of the cDNA.</s><s>Next, reads are organized by their cell barcodes, and individual UMIs are counted for each gene in each cell (Extended Experimental Procedures).</s><s>The result, shown at far right, is a "digital expression matrix" in which each column corresponds to a cell, each row corresponds to a gene, and each entry is the integer number of transcripts detected from that gene, in that cell.</s><s>cell for 54 HEK (human) STAMPs (blue) and 28 3T3 (mouse) STAMPs (green) that were sequenced to a mean read depth of 737,240 high-quality aligned reads per cell.</s><s>(E,F) Correlation between gene expression measurements in Drop-Seq and non-singlecell RNA-seq methods.</s><s>Comparison of Drop-Seq gene expression measurements (averaged across 550 STAMPs) to measurements from bulk RNA analyzed by: (E) an in-solution template switch amplification (TSA) procedure similar to Smart-Seq2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Picelli et al., 2013)</ref> (Extended Experimental Procedures); and (F) Illumina TruSeq mRNA-Seq.</s><s>All comparisons involve RNA derived from the same cell culture flask (3T3 cells).</s><s>All expression counts were converted to average transcripts per million (ATPM) and plotted as log (1+ATPM).</s><s>(G) Quantitation of Drop-Seq capture efficiency by ERCC spike-ins.</s><s>Drop-Seq was performed with ERCC control synthetic RNA at an estimated concentration of 100,000 ERCC RNA molecules per droplet.</s><s>84 beads were sequenced at a mean depth of 2.4 million reads, aligned to the ERCC reference sequences, and UMIs counted for each ERCC species, after applying a stringent down-correction for potential sequencing errors (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> and Extended Experimental Procedures).</s><s>For each ERCC RNA species above an average concentration of one molecule per droplet, the predicted number of molecules per droplet was plotted in log space (x-axis), versus the actual number of molecules detected per droplet by Drop-Seq, also in log space (y-axis).</s><s>The intercept of a regression line, constrained to have a slope of 1 and fitted to the seven highest points, was used to estimate a conversion factor (0.128).</s><s>A second estimation, using the average number of detected transcripts divided by the number of ERCC molecules used (100,000), yielded a conversion factor of 0.125.</s><s>Maximal and minimal expression was calculated for each gene across a sliding window of the ordered cells, and compared with shuffled cells to obtain a false discovery rate (FDR) (Experimental Procedures).</s><s>The plotted genes (FDR threshold of 5%) were then clustered by k-means analysis to identify sets of genes with similar expression patterns.</s><s>Cluster boundaries are represented by dashed gray lines.</s><s>(C) Representative cell cycle regulated genes discovered by Drop-Seq.</s><s>Selected genes that were found to be cell cycle regulated in both the HEK and 3T3 cell sets.</s><s>Left, genes that are well-known to be cell cycle regulated.</s><s>Right, some genes identified in this analysis that were not previously known to be associated with the cell cycle (Experimental Procedures).</s><s>A complete list of cell cycle regulated genes can be found in Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>.</s><s>In this heat map, rows correspond to individual genes found to be selectively upregulated in individual clusters (p &lt; 0.01, Bonferroni corrected); columns are individual cells, ordered by cluster (1-39).</s><s>Clusters with &gt; 1,000 cells were downsampled to 1,000 cells to prevent them from dominating the plot.</s><s>(D) Gene expression similarity relationships among 39 inferred cell populations.</s><s>Average expression across all detected genes was calculated for each of 39 cell clusters, and the relative (Euclidean) distances between gene-expression patterns for the 39 clusters are represented by a dendrogram.</s><s>The branches of the dendrogram were annotated by examining the differential expression of known markers for retina cell classes and types.</s><s>Twelve examples are shown at right, using violin plots to represent the distribution of expression within the clusters.</s><s>Violin plots for additional genes are in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6A</ref>.</s><s>(E) Representation of experimental replicates in each cell population.</s><s>tSNE plot from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2B</ref>, with each cell now colored by experimental replicate (for visual clarity, the central rod cluster was downsampled to 10,000 cells).</s><s>Each of the 7 replicates contributes to all 39 cell populations.</s><s>Cluster 36 (arrow), in which these replicates are unevenly represented, expressed markers of fibroblasts, which are not native to the retina and are presumably a dissection artifact (see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6B</ref>).</s><s>(F) Trajectory of amacrine clustering as a function of number of cells analyzed.</s><s>Three different downsampled datasets were generated: (1) 500, (2) 2,000, or (3) 9,731 cells (Extended Experimental Procedures).</s><s>Cells identified as amacrines (clusters 3-23) in the full analysis are here colored by their cluster identities in that analysis.</s><s>Analyses of smaller numbers of cells incompletely distinguished these subpopulations from one another.</s><s>(C) Nomination of novel candidate markers of amacrine subpopulations.</s><s>Each cluster was screened for genes differentially expressed in that cluster relative to all other amacrine clusters (p&lt;0.01,</s><s>Bonferroni corrected) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McDavid et al., 2013)</ref>, and filtered for those with highest relative enrichment.</s><s>Expression of a single candidate marker for each cluster is shown across all amacrines.</s><s>(D) Validation of MAF as a marker for a GABAergic amacrine population.</s><s>Staining of a fixed adult retina from wild-type mice for MAF (panels i, ii, v, and green staining in iv and vii), GAD1 (panels iii and iv, red staining), and SLC6A9 (panels vi and vii, red staining), demonstrating co-localization of MAF with GAD1, but not SLC6A9.</s><s>(E) Differential expression of cluster 7 (MAF+) with nearest neighboring amacrine cluster (#6).</s><s>Average gene expression was compared between cells in clusters 6 and 7;
