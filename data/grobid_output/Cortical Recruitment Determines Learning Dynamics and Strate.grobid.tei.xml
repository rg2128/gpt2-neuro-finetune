<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Sounds with identical levels can recruit different activity levels.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the relationship between stimulus salience and neuronal recruitment, we first aimed to identify sounds recruiting different amounts of cortical activity.</s><s>A previous report has shown that complex sounds with different frequency content but equal duration and sound pressure level can recruit population responses of different sizes in cat auditory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>To test if a similar phenomenon exists in mice, which would then allow us to experimentally decouple recruitment from physical intensity, we chose three short, complex sounds (70 ms duration) containing a large range of frequencies and temporal modulations, but normalized at equal mean pressure level (73 dB SPL, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>These sounds displayed different power spectra in the 10-30 kHz range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) where the mouse ear is most sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s><s>We thus wondered if this discrepancy was affecting their detectability.</s><s>To do so, we trained mice to lick on a water port after presentation of any of the three sounds randomly presented in the same task to obtain a reward (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>We then measured response probability to decreasing intensity levels.</s><s>All mice experience the three sounds in the same task.</s><s>We observed that, for all sounds, response probability steadily decreased down to chance level as measured in the absence of sound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Yet, no significant response difference was observed across the three sounds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), indicating that the chosen 73 dB SPL was at a comparable distance from the detection threshold for the three sounds.</s></p><p><s>We assessed recruitment of neural activity in the auditory cortex in response to these three sounds using two-photon calcium imaging in awake, passively listening mice.</s><s>We imaged six mice that were injected with AAV1-GCAMP6s virus in auditory cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Recordings were followed by an automated image registration and segmentation algorithm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> that allowed the isolation of 15,511 neurons across 27 imaging sites, from which large fluorescence signals could be observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>The fields-of-view were either 0.5 × 0.5 or 1 × 1 mm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), allowing a rapid tiling of the full extent of primary and secondary auditory cortex (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Cortical depths were randomly chosen ranging between 100 and 300 µm corresponding to layer 2/3.</s><s>The mouse auditory cortex (primary+secondary) contains ~200,000 neurons in one hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and thus ~50,000 neurons in layer 2/3, so we expect our sample of ~15,000 neurons to be representative for supragranular auditory cortex.</s><s>As typical learning rules are dependent on presynaptic firing rate 10-14 , we first measured the amplitude of the mean-deconvolved calcium signals, a proxy for neuronal firing rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , recorded across the entire duration of the response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>We observed that at 73 dB intensity, sound A elicited at least twofold less cortical activity than sounds B and C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>This was consistently observed across mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Sounds producing more firing in the population activated also more neurons (~18% for sound A and ~25% for B and C, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>But note that the fraction of responsive neurons strongly depends on statistical threshold.</s><s>Furthermore, the observed differences in neuronal activity recruitment was consistent with previous, independent measurements performed under anesthesia (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>All three sounds elicited distinct response patterns as evaluated by correlation-based population similarity measures and sound identity could be decoded with high accuracy based on single-trial response patterns using linear classifiers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>), indicating that sound discriminability was not affected by cortical recruitment.</s></p><p><s>Another discrepancy between cortical recruitment and the physical intensity of a stimulus can be observed using sounds with different temporal intensity profiles.</s><s>Up-ramping sounds elicit larger cortical responses in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and other animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> than their time-symmetric down-ramps, despite equal physical energies.</s><s>This effect correlates with asymmetries in subjectively perceived loudness in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>We confirmed this result for 2 s white noise sounds ramping between 60 and 85 dB, with a clear effect at sound onset despite the lower initial intensity level  <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure">C</ref>.</s><s>Mean calcium responses to sound A (0.05 ± 0.03% ΔF/F.s -1 , mean±SEM) were significantly smaller than to B (0.10 ± 0.02% ΔF/F.s -1 ) and C (0.12 ± 0.02% ΔF/F.s -1 ; sign test, p = 0.0008 and p = 0.026, n = 27 sessions, 15,511 neurons in 6 mice).</s><s>Sound B and C also activated a larger fraction of neurons (24 and 25%; two-sided Signed test across 20 sound repetitions, p &lt; 0.05) than A (18%; χ 2 test, p = 10 -41 and 6 × 10 -31 , n = 15,511).</s><s>f Population response reliability (diagonal) and similarity (off-diagonal) matrix for sounds A, B, and C. The pair-wise discriminability value, computed with a linear classifier is indicated in red.</s><s>g Mean deconvolved calcium signals for 6757 auditory cortex neurons in 12 awake mice during 29 calcium imaging sessions for 2-s-long white noise sounds modulated in intensity between 60 dB and 85 dB upwards and downwards (mean between 0 and 0.5 s after sound onset for up: 0.80 ± 0.08% vs down: 0.62 ± 0.11%, Signed test p = 3.75 × 10 -4 , n = 29 sites, in 12 mice; mean between 0 and 2.5 s: 0.166 ± 0.58% vs down: 0.157 ± 0.57%, Signed test, p = 0.034).</s><s>The inset show the significantly different (χ 2 test, p = 10 -68 ) fraction of responsive cells (75 and 61%; two-sided Signed test, p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>h Mean deconvolved calcium signals for 59,590 auditory cortex neurons in seven awake mice during 60 calcium imaging sessions for white noise sounds modulated in intensity at 1Hz and at 20Hz (0.357 + -0.032% and 0.15 + -0.034% ΔF/ F.s -1 , signed test, p = 0.0009).</s><s>The inset show the significantly different (χ 2 test, p = 10 -189 ) fraction of responsive cells (37 and 29%; two-sided Signed test, p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>Error bars represent standard errors (SEM) in up-ramps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>Rhythmic amplitude modulations provided another striking example, as we observed that a white noise sound modulated at 1λ produces more activity than when modulated at 20Hz, although the two sounds have the same physical energy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In summary, when different sounds are played at an intensity above the detection threshold, the amount of recruited cortical activity in mouse auditory cortex depends on factors other than intensity and can vary across different sounds.</s><s>Based on this observation, we asked whether cortical recruitment could be related to stimulus salience in a learning task.</s></p><p><s>Cortical recruitment influences learning speed.</s><s>Classically, relative salience measures are performed using an overshadowing paradigm in which two stimuli are conditioned together, as a compound stimulus, to an unconditioned stimulus.</s><s>Then, salience is derived from the level of the conditioned response elicited by each stimulus component individually.</s><s>While this approach is valid when the compound is made of stimuli from two different sensory modalities, two simultaneous sounds are likely to fuse perceptually, precluding measurement of their individual saliences with the classical overshadowing design <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Alternatively, Rescorla and Wagner's model 3 postulates that learning speed follows stimulus salience.</s><s>We thus decided to test if learning speed relates to cortical recruitment, using an auditory-cued Go/ No-Go task.</s><s>To do so, water-deprived mice were first trained to visit a lick-port and to receive a water reward if they licked after being presented with an S+ sound.</s><s>The main effect of this pretraining phase was to raise motivation rather than to learn soundreward association and thus could not be used to measure learning speed.</s><s>When mice collected rewards in at least 80% of their port visits, the Go/NoGo task was started by introducing a non-rewarded S-sound in half of the trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>After a large number of trials, mice succeeded to both sustain licking to the S+ and withdraw from licking for the S-(Fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), demonstrating discrimination of the two sounds.</s><s>Importantly, as typically observed in such tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , the S+ sound was rapidly associated with the lick response and the rate limiting factor in task learning was to associate the suppression of licking with the S-sound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Hence, learning speed depends more on the properties of the S-than of the S+ sound in this task.</s><s>Discrepancies between two stimuli X and Y can thus be measured by comparing the learning speed of the X versus Y Go/NoGo discrimination when X is the S-against the speed observed when Y is the S-.</s><s>For example, if X is less salient than Y, we expect learning to be slower when X is the S-.</s><s>We therefore trained eight cohorts of mice to compare learning speed for sounds pairs A-B, A-C, B-C, and for the pair of sinusoidaly modulated sounds.</s><s>We also used learning speed data from an earlier study for discrimination of up and down-ramping sounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Plotting the population learning curves for the sound pairs with maximum cortical recruitment differences (A-B and A-C,), we qualitatively observed that the average learning speed was faster when cortical recruitment for the S-sound was larger than for the S+ sound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>), suggesting a link between learning speed and cortical recruitment.</s></p><p><s>However, looking at learning curves from individual mice, we noticed that the qualitative difference observed at the group level hides a more complex effect.</s><s>As often observed in animal training <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and as we previously reported for our task <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , most individual learning curves had a sigmoidal rather than exponential time course.</s><s>Specifically, the curves displayed a delay phase with no increase in performance followed by a learning phase with a steep performance increase.</s><s>Also, the duration of each phase was highly variable across animals as exemplified

systematic effect of cortical recruitment was observed for the delay phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we noticed that cortical recruitment had also an effect on interindividual variability.</s><s>When the S-sound recruited more activity than the S+ sound, learning phase duration was more homogenous than for the opposite sound assignment, especially for the two sound pairs with a large difference of cortical recruitment (mean normalized standard deviation difference: 93% ± 18%,

sounds, the probability to obtain by chance a consistent result across five independent experiments would be only about 3% (2 -5 ), so we expect this eventuality to be rather unlikely.</s></p><p><s>A reinforcement learning model reproduces recruitment effects.</s><s>To theoretically evaluate the generality of these results, we tested a recent model of the discrimination task, extending the Rescorla-Wagner reinforcement learning framework to a simple but more biologically interpretable neuronal model (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>The model postulates that associative learning occurs by adjusting the synaptic weights between sensory and decision neural populations described by population firing rate variables.</s><s>At the input, two populations are specific for the S+ and S-sounds respectively, which we denote as Ŝ+ and Ŝ-, and one population, Ĉ, which represents information common to S+ and S-trials (e.g.</s><s>overlap between the S+ and S-representations or activity independent of sound, for example, related to visiting the lick port).</s><s>Population Ĉ is an essential element of the model to reproduce high initial hit-rates during delayed discrimination learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>The decision population has two ensembles: one promoting and one inhibiting licking (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>Adjustment of synaptic weights happens through a Hebbian learning rule modulated by Rescorla and Wagner's (1972) δ-rule which gates weight updates by the reward expectation error.</s><s>However, the employed δ-rule is asymmetric, meaning that the learning rate is larger by a factor v when an unexpected reward occurs, as compared to when an expected reward does not occur.</s><s>This asymmetry is crucial for capturing the fast raise of the hit-rate, and slower adjustment of the correct rejection-rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Last, synaptic updates are multiplicative, meaning that weight updates are proportional to the current weight value <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> .</s><s>The key feature of multiplicative learning is that learning speed depends on the current strength of the synapses.</s><s>Thus, the same model can have very slow learning (low weights) as in the delay phase and faster learning (high weights) as in the learning phase.</s><s>Furthermore, this feature makes learning dynamics highly sensitive to the initial synaptic weights, which become important parameters that can even account for most of the inter-individual variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, the activity level of the Ŝ+ and Ŝ-populations can be varied in the model, allowing to simulate the impact of cortical recruitment, for example, by setting either Ŝor Ŝ+ activity level to 2 while level for the other population is 1 (but note that this value can be widely varied without changing our conclusions, Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>, Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref>, Supplementary Note 1).</s></p><p><s>We therefore wondered whether this model reproduces the observed relationships between cortical recruitment and mean learning speed and its variability.</s><s>The dynamics of the model depend on the choice of its three core parameters (noise level, learning rate, and asymmetry, see Methods) and of its initial synaptic weights.</s><s>We showed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref>  curves can be fitted by adjusting these parameters, even without accounting for recruitment difference.</s><s>Nevertheless, to test if the model captures the effect of recruitment, one can use a realistic set of parameters and test if asymmetric recruitment produces the effects seen during the behavior.</s><s>We thus looked at the qualitative behavior of the model using a set of parameters obtained in a previous group of experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> by fitting the individual learning curves from 15 mice trained in a task identical to the one used in this study.</s><s>This parameter set included 15 different values of the initial weights, and core parameters were identical for all mice, which we showed is sufficient to account for inter-individual variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Based on these parameters, and systematically varying the recruitment values in simulations, we observed that recruitment differences were positively correlated to learning phase duration in the model, similar to the experimental results (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).</s><s>Also, as illustrated when neuronal recruitment is doubled for one of the two stimuli, the model reproduced two other experimental observations.</s><s>First, the delay phase was not significantly influenced by recruitment (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>).</s><s>Second, the variability of the learning phase duration was much stronger when S-recruited less activity than S+ (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, without any tuning, the model qualitatively reproduced the complexity of the experimental dynamics, offering an opportunity to explore possible mechanisms for the complex effects of neuronal recruitment on learning behavior in a precise theoretical framework.</s></p><p><s>Learning speed effects depend on initial synaptic strengths.</s><s>To understand the origin of inter-individual variability in our simulations, we plotted the learning phase duration against the values of the three initial synaptic weight parameters (w Ce and w Ci for the Ĉ population, and a single initial value w S for the four weights of the Ŝ+ and Ŝpopulation, as in Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>First, we observed that the initial weight between sound-specific neural populations and the decision populations (w S ) had no correlation with learning speed duration.</s><s>This was expected as w S mostly impacts the delay phase because small initial synaptic weights lead to slow initial learning (multiplicative rule).</s><s>After the delay phase, sufficient learning has occurred for the sound-specific synaptic weights to increase performance at high speed and w S does not influence learning speed anymore.</s><s>Our earlier results <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> showed that w S is the main determinant of the delay phase duration and is highly variable across mice.</s><s>These interindividual w S variations induced large variations of delay phase duration masking the smaller impact of neuronal recruitment on delay phase in simulations (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that variability in initial connectivity may explain the independence between cortical recruitment and delay phase duration in behavior.</s></p><p><s>A second observation was that the learning phase is long when the initial weights w Ce and w Ci (non-specific population Ĉ) are small, but only when S-recruits less activity than S+ (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, for large weights, the recruitment differences between S + and S-have no effect on learning phase (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>).</s><s>Hence, variability in initial connectivity from non-specific representation of the task may explain the larger variability in learning phase duration observed in behavior when cortical recruitment for S-is smaller than recruitment for S+ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To better understand why the initial conditions of w Ce and w Ci gate the influence of neuronal recruitment on learning speed, we plotted the time-course of both excitatory and inhibitory connection weights for four combinations of recruitment and initial weights values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a-d</ref>, see also Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> for the same analysis with a smaller recruitment ratio).</s><s>These plots show that the large prolongation of the learning phase when neuronal recruitment is lower for S-than for S+ and when w Ce and w Ci are small (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>) is due

Data file the delay phase of low initial weights from Ŝand Ĉ populations to the No-Go population.</s><s>This impacts the effective speed (multiplicative learning rule) at which correct rejections

learning is obtained solely based on the Ĉ common population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>When S-recruits more activity, learning is always fast (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>) because, in all cases, the rate limiting process remains the abolition of licking to the NoGo stimulus (due to learning rule asymmetry, see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>This process is boosted by strong Ŝrecruitment.</s><s>Also, in these conditions, acquisition of the NoGo stimulus is independent of w Ce and w Ci , because the Ĉ population drives the Go response.</s><s>Thus, the complex modulation of learning phase duration by neuronal recruitment is due, in the model, to a non-trivial assignment of the three sensory populations to either Go or NoGo responses, based on neuronal recruitment distribution.</s><s>Specifically, when the Ŝpopulation recruits more activity, it is assigned to NoGo, while the Ĉ population drives the Go response.</s><s>In contrast, when the Ŝ+ population recruits more activity, it is assigned to the Go response, and in this case, the Ĉ population drives the NoGo response.</s><s>These different solutions of the binary discrimination problem could be seen as different strategies chosen by the model or eventually the animals during the learning process.</s></p><p><s>The existence of multiple solutions to the task provides a testable, general prediction of reinforcement learning models which use population activity as a salience parameter (independent of the magnitude of recruitment differences, see analytical arguments in Supplemental Experimental Procedures).</s><s>The test would be to isolate and drive the neurons corresponding to Ĉ in the brain.</s><s>Activation of the Ĉ population alone should drive licking when S-recruits more activity, and should not drive licking when S-recruits less activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Recruitment determines learning strategy.</s><s>Testing this prediction was impractical with our sound-based Go/NoGo discrimination protocol, because the neurons encoding information common to S+ and S-trials (Ĉ population) likely code for multiple cues, including (i) the overlap of S+ and S-representations and (ii) all cues related to the decision to visit the lick port, and thus cannot be isolated.</s><s>Therefore, we decided to test the model predictions in an artificial but better controlled experiment in which head-fixed mice had to discriminate optogenetically driven cortical ensembles.</s><s>We used a custom-made video-projector setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> to project precise 2D light patterns through a cranial window placed above the auditory cortex in Emx1-Cre x Ai27 mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>, b, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure"

target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> and thereby reliably positioned optogenetic stimulation spots in homologous regions across mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>).</s><s>We defined three circular optogenetic stimulation spots out of which we constructed two stimuli.</s><s>One of the three spots, the Ĉ spot, was common to the two S+ and Sstimuli and the two other spots corresponded to the stimulusspecific neuronal populations Ŝ+ and Ŝ-(e.g.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the Go-trial cue consisted of simultaneous activation of Ŝ+ and Ĉ and the NoGo-trial cue consisted of simultaneous activation of Ŝ and Ĉ.</s><s>Furthermore, cues common to S+ and S-related to licking port visits in the sound task were eliminated in the headfixed task design, as mice did not initiate the randomly interleaved trials.</s><s>Thus the Ĉ spot was the only cue common to Go and NoGo-trials.</s><s>We doubled the diameter of either the Ŝ+ or the Ŝspot to create a difference in cortical recruitment between the two input representations.</s><s>Electrophysiological measurements of the population firing rate elicited by the small and large spots showed that the recruitment difference between the stronger and weaker stimuli was ~69% (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), comparable with the population recruitment differences observed for sounds (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Also, we measured that the large disk activates ~2.5 more neurons than the small disk (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Given that the Ĉ spot has a small diameter, we could evaluate the fraction of cells commonly activated by the S+ and S-stimuli within the cells activated by S+ and Sas 1/(1+1+2.5)</s><s>≈ 22%, similar to the fraction of cells commonly activated by sounds (e.g.</s><s>18%, 18%, 23% for sound pairs A-B, A-C, and B-C, s.e.m = 0.3%, binomial distribution).</s><s>Thus the artificial stimuli, although not identical to sound responses had comparable characteristics.</s><s>Mice were then initially trained to obtain a water reward by licking after the coincident activation of the Ŝ+ and Ĉ spot.</s><s>When 80% performance was reached in this stage, the discrimination training started.</s><s>Mice kept licking in the presence of the Ŝ+ spot and learned, within hundreds of trials to avoid licking in the presence of the Ŝspot (both activated together with Ĉ, Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>), reaching a steady state performance of 94.7% ± 4.5% correct trials (hit rate 93.9% ± 3.3%, false alarm rate 4.5% ± 1.3%, n = 8 mice, see Fig. <ref type="figure">6e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, in this task setting, the stringent definition of the common Ĉ population, activated during the initial motivation training, likely resulted in the systematic establishment of strong initial connections for this population at the beginning of the discrimination training, leading to homogenous durations of the learning phase (212 ± 117 trials for the large Ŝvs 260 ± 220 for the small Ŝ-, p = 0.26, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, see also Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>) independent of recruitment (Figs. <ref

responses (84% ± 6% response probability, n = 6 mice, Fig. <ref type="figure">6e</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, in the group of mice that had a larger Ŝ+ spot, activation of Ĉ elicited no licking response (2% ± 1% response probability, n = 7 mice, Fig. <ref type="figure">6f</ref>).</s><s>Note that these effects are unlikely to be caused by inhibition of Ĉ when paired with the large Ŝ+ or Ŝspot, as no inhibition from the larger spot was observed at the location of Ĉ in calibration experiments (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>In addition, behavioral responses to Ŝ+ or Ŝalone were compatible with our model (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">6e, f</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>By confirming the model's predictions, these results

salience.</s><s>Moreover, these effects can be precisely reproduced by a reinforcement learning model of the task.</s><s>Finally, training mice to discriminate optogenetically evoked cortical patterns, and manipulating these patterns, we showed that neuronal recruitment determines which elements of the cortical representation are selected to drive each conditioned action.</s><s>This corroborates, in a causal manner, the idea that cortical recruitment is a neuronal correlate of stimulus salience.</s></p><p><s>Several studies indicate that cortical recruitment can vary across

discrepancies may have multiple origins.</s><s>First, it is well known that the mouse cochlea is more sensitive in its middle frequency range <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , which could explain the overrepresentations of sounds in this frequency range (10-30 kHz) in cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>In this case, cortical recruitment is expected to reflect

target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> .</s><s>But a second source of recruitment differences may be the nonlinearities of cortical representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> .</s><s>For example, a recent study suggested that cortical response patterns can be invariant to changes in intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s><s>In this case, cortical recruitment should also depend on the higher level features composing sound representations and on how broadly these features are represented in cortex.</s></p><p><s>The idea that the amount of neuronal activity recruited by a stimulus influences behavior has been proposed in different contexts.</s><s>For example, several studies indicate that attention can boost neuronal firing associated to behaviorally relevant stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> and thereby make them more discriminable from other stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> .</s><s>Also, several theoretical studies have proposed that attention impacts learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> and some reinforcement learning models can account for such effects by dynamically weighting stimuli according to their predictive relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> .</s><s>It will be an interesting research avenue to analyze the relative contribution of bottom-up sound encoding and attentional top-down mechanisms to the level of cortical recruitment.</s><s>Earlier reports, using direct microstimulation of the cortex, showed that low levels of neuronal recruitment can impact detection probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> .</s><s>Here, we show that neuronal recruitment for stimuli that are well beyond detection threshold still impact the learning process.</s><s>Even if such effects are predicted by the Rescorla and Wagner model 3 , capturing their details requires a refinement of the original model.</s><s>In particular, we had to introduce a more realistic multiplicative learning rule which renders learning speed not only dependent on neuronal recruitment, but also on the current synaptic strength.</s><s>This property has important consequences.</s><s>First, it introduces variability in the relationship between recruitment and learning speed, through large interindividual variations of the initial weights for the synapses involved in the task.</s><s>Second, the multiplicative rule makes learning speed proportional to the product of neuronal recruitment and connectivity, allowing for more robustness, by compensating weak neuronal recruitment with stronger initial connections (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).</s><s>In our experiments, this phenomenon tends to stabilize learning speed, explaining why neuronal recruitment does not always impact the learning phase duration, except for particular initial conditions for which compensation occurs too slowly (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Strong pre-established connections can lead to fast learning for specific stimuli with innate meaning.</s><s>In this study, we have shown an effect of cortical recruitment on learning speed for five different pairs of sounds which had no particular meaning to the animal.</s><s>This does not exclude the possibility that some sounds, in particular, sounds with learnt or innate meaning would show a different relationship.</s><s>For example, pup calls are extremely salient to mothers but trigger little activity in cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> .</s><s>This could be due to strong pre-existing wiring between cortical neurons responding to pup calls compensating for limited recruitment.</s><s>So, even if, as we show, cortical recruitment plays a role in the salience of a sound, general theories of salience should also account for potential a priori meaning of stimulus, via pre-existing connections, as simple extensions of our model would suggest, or via more complex cognitive processes assigning value to the sounds.</s></p><p><s>The complex dynamical phenomena described in our study make learning speed measurements a more complicated proxy for stimulus salience than the overshadowing protocol which relies on steady state behavior, after the dynamical phase of the association.</s><s>However, it allows the comparison of salience for stimuli from the same sensory modality.</s><s>As our extended multiplicative model only diverges from the Rescorla-Wagner model for the transient dynamical part of the association process, it reproduces overshadowing effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , and can also predict how elements of sensory representations are assigned to different conditioned responses in a more complex task setting.</s><s>Here, by conditioning mice to compound stimuli composed of multiple optogenetically activated neuronal ensembles (Fig. <ref

surface and potentially activating ChR2 expressing neurons throughout the cortical depth.</s><s>Intrinsic imaging was performed in isoflurane anesthetized mice (1.1% delivered through SomnoSuite, Kent Scientific).</s><s>To compute intrinsic signal maps we divided the red light image of the cortical surface after the onset of a stimulation (average over 2 s) with 2-s-long pure tones (4, 8, 16 and 32 kHz) by the mean image immediately before stimulus onset.</s></p><p><s>Calibration of optogenetic.</s><s>For calibration of optogenetic stimulation, a small aperture was drilled in the cranial window with a diamond-coated dental drill during isoflurane anesthesia.</s><s>30 min after surgery, 4 × 8 silicon probes (Neuronexus) were implanted at a ~35°angle in auditory cortex in the awake head-fixed mouse.</s><s>Recordings were performed at three different depths (400, 600, and 800 µm) using a pre-amplifier and multiplexer coupled to a USB acquisition card (Intan Technologies).</s><s>Sounds and light stimulations were randomly presented at 2.5 s and each repeated 10 times.</s><s>Single unit spikes were detected and sorted from multi-unit spikes using the Phy Suite (https://github.com/kwikteam/phy).</s><s>Light stimuli consisted of small and large disk (360 µm and 720 µm diameter) presented at different positions of a two-dimensional grid centered on the probe location (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>For small disks, the grid included 5 × 8 locations with a regular Δx = Δy = 360 µm spacing.</s><s>For large disks, the grid included 3 × 4 locations with a regular spacing of 480 µm.</s><s>Population firing rate elicited by a single disk was estimated as the integral P Locations r x;y ΔxΔy of the responses r x,y to the disk centered at locations that were within in the extent of the smaller of the two grids (large disks: all locations, extent 1440 × 1920 µm; small disk: 4 × 5 locations, spanning 1440 × 1800 µm).</s><s>The integrals for big and small disks were normalized by Δx 0 Δy 0 = 360 × 360 µm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>The overall fraction of responsive neurons over the extent of

ðx; yÞ is the number responsive cells at each disk location, N location is the number of locations and N cells is the number of recorded cells.</s></p><p><s>Go/NoGo discrimination behavior.</s><s>Mice were water-deprived and trained daily for 200-300 trials.</s><s>Mice first performed 4 habituation sessions to learn to obtain a water rewards (~5 µl) by licking on a spout over a threshold after the positive stimulus S+.</s><s>After habituation, the fraction of collected rewards was ~80%.</s><s>The learning protocol then started in which mice also received a non-rewarded, negative sound S-for which they had to decreasing licking below threshold to avoid an 8 s time-out.</s><s>For the freely moving complex sound discrimination, S+ and S-sounds consisted of two 4 kHz pips (50 ms) followed by one of the three 70 ms complex click shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>.</s><s>The interval between the offset and onset of the pips and click was 375 ms.</s><s>Licking was assessed 0.58 s after the specific sound cue in a 1-s long window by an infrared beam at the spout.</s><s>For the intensity ramp discrimination, licking was assessed in a 1.5-s window after sound offset.</s><s>In both cases, licking was considered above threshold if the infrared beam in front of the licking tube was broken during 75% of the measurement time-window.</s><s>Positive and negative sounds were played in a pseudorandom order with the constraint that exactly 4 positive and 4 negative sounds must be played every 8 trials.</s><s>For learning curves, performance was measured as the fraction of correct positive and correct negative trials over bins of 100 trials.</s><s>For the optogenetically driven, head-fixed discrimination task, the S+ and S-stimuli were each composed of two disks of blue light (465 nm) flashing at 20Hz for 1 s.</s><s>One of the two disks (noted Ĉ) was common to S+ and S-stimuli, the other disk was condition-specific.</s><s>The three disk locations were chosen in similar tonotopic locations across mice based on intrinsic imaging maps.</s><s>They were precisely re-positioned for every training session using an automated registration procedure based on blood-vessel patterns.</s><s>A strong masking light was used to prevent the animal from using visual cues in the task.</s><s>The common disk was 360 µm in diameter.</s><s>In one set of mice, the disk specific to S-was 720 µm in diameter, while the S+ specific disk was 360 µm in diameter.</s><s>In the other set of mice, sizes of the specific disks were swapped.</s><s>Headfixed mice performed 200-300 trials per day with an inter-trial interval randomized between 3 and 7 s.</s><s>Individual licks were detected through an electric circuit connecting the mouse and the lick tube.</s><s>Then, each trial was started only if the mouse was not spontaneously licking for at least 3 s (in addition to the inter-trial interval).</s><s>Mice were first trained to respond to the S+ stimulus by producing at least 3-5 licks (depending on the mouse) to get the 5 µL water reward.</s><s>When the mouse could collect more than 80% of the rewards, the S-stimulus was introduced.</s></p><p><s>Licking above threshold after S-was punished with a 7-s timeout.</s></p><p><s>Reinforcement learning model.</s><s>The model has been described extensively in a previous publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>In short, it is composed of three sensory units (Ŝ+, Ŝ-, and Ĉ, representing populations of neurons) whose activity described by a threedimensional vector X and which are connected to a simple decision circuit (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>Cortical recruitment is modeled by changing the firing value of the sound units.</s><s>When the S-stimulus recruits less activity than the S+ stimulus, the input vectors are: X S+ = [1 0 2] or X S-= [1 1 0].</s><s>When S-recruits more activity than S +, the input vectors are: X S+ = [1 0 1] or X S-= [1 2 0].</s><s>The decision circuit is composed of all-or-none response unit (y = 0 or 1) which linearly sums the three sensory inputs (representing synaptic populations) under the form of three direct excitatory connections and of a graded feed-forward inhibition from a virtual inhibitory unit in fact equivalent to three direct inhibitory connections.</s><s>The output of model is described by a single equation for the decision unit:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y ¼ θðW E :X À W I :X À ξÞ ð<label>1Þ</label></formula><p><s>in which θ is the Heaviside step function.</s><s>W E and W I are three-dimensional positive vectors describing the excitatory synaptic weights from the sensory units to the decision and inhibitory units respectively.</s><s>The variable ξ is a Gaussian random noise process of unit variance which models the stochasticity of behavioral choices.</s></p><p><s>Based on the action outcome (R = 1 for a reward, R = -1 for no reward), the learning rule for the synaptic weights is implemented as:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">δW E ¼ αW E f ½R À σðW E À W I Þ:XyX<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">δW I ¼ ÀαW I f ½R À σðW E À W I Þ:XyX<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p><s>in which ⊙ is the Hadamard (element-wise) product implementing the multiplicative rule, yx is a Hebbian term, α is the learning rate and σ is a parameter related to the noisiness of the model and setting its asymptotic performance.</s><s>To account for the faster improvement of performance for rewarded as compared to non-rewarded trials, positive expectation errors are more strongly weighted than negative ones, thanks to the asymmetric function f[u] = u if u ≤ 0 and f[u] = vu if u &gt; 0. The parameter v is typically &gt;1, consistent with the activity of basal ganglia dopaminergic neurons in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66</ref> and monkeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> coding for reward expectation error.</s></p><p><s>As described above, the equations of the model are stochastic due to the Gaussian random noise process ξ.</s><s>To compute the response probability estimates plotted throughout the study, we used a previously established probability equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , valid for learning dynamics much slower than fluctuations (ergodic approximation).</s><s>The probability to make a lick response given the input vector X s+ or X s-is:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_4">p SþjSÀ ¼ pðy ¼ 1jX ¼ X SþjSÀ Þ ¼ 1 2 1 þ erf ΔW:X SþjSÀ ffiffi ffi 2 p<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p><s>where Δw ¼ wE À wI represents now the average observed values of difference between the excitatory and inhibitory connections.</s><s>In addition, the plasticity equations become:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_5">δW E ¼ α 2 W E f ½1 À σΔW:X Sþ p Sþ X Sþ þ f ½À1 À σΔW:X SÀ p SÀ X SÀ À Á<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">δW I ¼ À α 2 W I f ½1 À σΔW:X Sþ p Sþ X Sþ þ f ½À1 À σΔW:X SÀ p SÀ X SÀ À Á<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p><s>Statistical tests.</s><s>Unless otherwise specified, all quantifications are given as mean ±standard error (SEM).</s><s>To statistically assess the differences between paired measurements (e.g.</s><s>activity for two different sounds elicited in the same neuronal populations) we used the non-parametric Signed test.</s><s>To compare two sets of measurements (e.g.</s><s>delay and learning phase duration for two groups of mice) we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test.</s><s>Assessment of the differences in the fraction of responsive neurons for different sounds was done with the χ 2 test which evaluates differences in the distributions of two binary variables.</s><s>All tests are two-sided.</s><s>No data was excluded from the analysis sample.</s></p><p><s>Reporting summary.</s><s>Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Spectro-temporal differences in complex sounds do not affect near-threshold detectability.</s><s>a Spectrograms of three 70-ms-long complex sounds, with power spectrum on the right.</s><s>b Schematics describing the auditory detection task.</s><s>c Mean response probability for six mice trained to detect sounds A, B, and C at 73 dB to get a reward and probed with lower sound intensities.</s><s>While the effect of intensity was significant, there was no effect of sound identity (Friedman test, p intensity = 2.3 × 10 -9 , p sound = 0.43, n = 6 mice).</s><s>Error bars represent standard errors (SEM).</s><s>Source data are provided as a Source Data file</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,222.55,600.89,145.48,85.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>
