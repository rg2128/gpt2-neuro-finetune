<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATAC-seq probes chromatin accessibility with transposons</head><p><s>Hyperactive Tn5 transposase <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , loaded in vitro with adapters for high-throughput DNA sequencing, can simultaneously fragment and tag a genome with sequencing adapters (previously described as "tagmentation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> ).</s><s>Because transposons have been shown to integrate into active regulatory elements in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , we hypothesized that transposition by purified Tn5, a prokaryotic transposase, on small numbers of unfixed eukaryotic nuclei would interrogate regions of accessible chromatin.</s><s>Here we describe Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin followed by high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq).</s><s>ATAC-seq uses Tn5 transposase to integrate its adapter payload into regions of accessible chromatin, whereas steric hindrance less accessible chromatin makes transposition less probable.</s><s>Therefore, amplifiable DNA fragments suitable for high-throughput sequencing are preferentially generated at locations of open chromatin (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The entire assay and library construction can be carried out in a simple two-step process involving Tn5 insertion and PCR.</s><s>In contrast, published DNase-and FAIRE-seq protocols for assaying chromatin accessibility involve multi-step protocols and many potentially loss-prone steps, such as adapter ligation, gel purification, and crosslink reversal.</s><s>For instance, a published DNaseseq protocol calls for approximately 44 steps, and two overnight incubations, while published FAIRE-seq protocols require two overnight incubations carried out over at least 3 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, these protocols require 1-50 million cells (FAIRE) or 50 million cells (DNase-seq) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , perhaps because of these complex workflows (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>In comparison to established methods, ATAC-seq enables rapid and efficient library generation because assay and library preparation are carried out in a single enzymatic step.</s></p><p><s>Extensive analyses show that ATAC-seq provides accurate and sensitive measure of chromatin accessibility genome-wide.</s><s>We carried out ATAC-seq on 50,000 and 500 unfixed nuclei isolated from GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line (ENCODE Tier 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> ) for comparison and validation with chromatin accessibility data sets, including DNase-seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and FAIREseq <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>At a locus previously highlighted by others 5 , (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), ATAC-seq has a signal-tonoise ratio similar to DNase-seq, which was generated from approximately 3 to 5 orders-ofmagnitude more cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Peak intensities were highly reproducible between technical replicates (R=0.98), and highly correlated between ATAC-seq and DNase-seq (R=0.79 and R=0.83, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), and we note that the majority of reads within peaks come from intersections of DNase and ATAC-seq peaks (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Comparing our data to DHSs identified in ENCODE DNase-seq data, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrate a similar sensitivity and specificity as DNase-seq (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>We also note that ATAC-seq peak intensities correlate well with markers of active chromatin and not with transposase sequence preference (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Highly sensitive open chromatin detection is maintained even when using 5,000 or 500 human nuclei as starting material (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>), although sensitivity is diminished for smaller numbers of input material, as can be seen in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATAC-seq insert sizes disclose nucleosome positions</head><p><s>We found that ATAC-seq paired-end reads produce detailed information about nucleosome packing and positioning.</s><s>The insert size distribution of sequenced fragments from human chromatin has clear periodicity of approximately 200 base pairs, suggesting many fragments are protected by integer multiples of nucleosomes (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>This fragment size distribution also shows clear periodicity equal to the helical pitch of DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>By partitioning insert size distribution according to functional classes of chromatin as defined by previous models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , and normalizing to the global insert distribution (see Methods) we observe clear classspecific enrichments across this insert size distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), demonstrating that these functional states of chromatin have an accessibility "fingerprint" that can be read out with ATAC-seq.</s><s>These differential fragmentation patterns are consistent with the putative functional state of these classes, as CTCF-bound regions are enriched for short fragments of DNA, while transcription start sites are differentially depleted for mono-, di-and trinucleosome associated fragments.</s><s>Transcribed and promoter flanking regions are enriched for longer multi-nucleosomal fragments, suggesting they may represent more compacted forms of chromatin.</s><s>Finally, prior studies have shown that certain DNA sequences are refractory to nuclease digestion and released as large, multi-nucleosome-sized fragments <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ; subsequent studies showed that such fragments are condensed heterochromatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Indeed we found repressed regions are depleted for short fragments and enriched for phased multinucleosomal inserts, consistent with their expected inaccessible state.</s><s>These data suggest that ATAC-seq reveals differentially accessible forms of chromatin, which have been long hypothesized to exist in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To explore nucleosome positioning within accessible chromatin in the GM12878 cell line, we partitioned our data into reads generated from putative nucleosome free regions of DNA, and reads likely derived from nucleosome associated DNA (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Using a simple heuristic that positively weights nucleosome associated fragments and negatively weights nucleosome free fragments (see Methods), we calculated a data track used to call nucleosome positions within regions of accessible chromatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>An example locus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>) contains a putative bidirectional promoter with CAGE data showing two transcription start sites (TSS) separated by ~700bps.</s><s>ATAC-seq reveals in fact two distinct nucleosome free regions, separated by a single well-positioned mononucleosome (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Compared to MNase-seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , ATAC-seq data is more amenable to detecting nucleosomes within putative regulatory regions, as the majority of reads are concentrated within accessible regions of chromatin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>By averaging signal across all active TSSs, we note nucleosome-free fragments are enriched at a canonical nucleosome-free promoter region overlapping the TSS, while our nucleosome signal is enriched both upstream and downstream of the active TSS, and displays characteristic phasing of upstream and downstream nucleosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Because ATAC-seq reads are concentrated at regions of open chromatin, we see strong nucleosome signal at the +1 nucleosome, which decreases at the +2, +3 and +4 nucleosomes, in contrast, MNase-seq nucleosome signal increases at larger distances from the TSS likely due to over digestion of more accessible nucleosomes.</s><s>Additionally, MNase-seq (4 billion reads) assays all nucleosomes, whereas reads generated from ATAC-seq (198 million paired reads) are concentrated at regulatory nucleosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Using our nucleosome calls, we further partitioned putative distal regulatory regions and TSSs into regions that were nucleosome free and regions that were predicted to be nucleosome bound.</s><s>We note that TSSs were enriched for nucleosome free regions when compared to distal elements, which tend to remain nucleosome rich (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest ATAC-seq can provide high-resolution readout of nucleosome associated and nucleosome free regions in regulatory elements genome wide.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATAC-seq reveals patterns of nucleosome-TF spacing</head><p><s>ATAC-seq high-resolution regulatory nucleosome maps can be used to understand the relationship between nucleosomes and DNA binding factors.</s><s>Using ChIP-seq data, we plotted the position of a variety of DNA binding factors with respect to the dyad of the nearest nucleosome.</s><s>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>) revealed major classes of binding with respect to the proximal nucleosome, including 1) a strongly nucleosome avoiding group of factors with binding events stereotyped at ~180 bases from the nearest nucleosome dyad (comprising C-FOS, NFYA and IRF3), 2) a class of factors that "nestle up" precisely to the expected end of nucleosome DNA contacts, which notably includes chromatin looping factors CTCF and cohesion complex subunits RAD21 and SMC3; 3) a large class of primarily TFs that have gradations of nucleosome avoiding or nucleosomeoverlapping binding behavior, and 4) a class whose binding sites tend to overlap nucleosome-associated DNA.</s><s>Interestingly, this final class includes chromatin remodeling factors such as CHD1 and SIN3A as well as RNA polymerase II, which appears to be enriched at the nucleosome boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>The interplay between precise nucleosome positioning and locations of DNA binding factor immediately suggests specific hypotheses for mechanistic studies, a potential advantage of ATAC-seq.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATAC-seq footprints infer factor occupancy genome-wide</head><p><s>ATAC-seq enables accurate inference of DNA binding factor occupancy genome-wide.</s><s>We reasoned that DNA sequences directly occupied by DNA-binding proteins are protected from transposition; the resulting sequence "footprint" reveals the presence of the DNAbinding protein at each site, analogous to DNase digestion footprints <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>At a specific CTCF binding site on chromosome 1, we observed a clear footprint (a deep notch of ATAC-seq signal), similar to footprints seen by DNase-seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , at the precise location of the CTCF motif that coincides with the summit of the CTCF ChIP-seq signal in GM12878 cells (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>We averaged ATAC-seq signal over all expected locations of CTCF within the genome and observed a well-stereotyped "footprint" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were obtained for a variety of common TFs (for examples see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>We inferred the CTCF binding probability from motif consensus score, evolutionary conservation, and ATAC-seq insertion data to generate a posterior probability of CTCF binding at all loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Results using ATAC-seq closely recapitulate ChIP-seq binding data in this cell line and compare favorably to DNase-based factor occupancy inference (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>), suggesting that factor occupancy data can be extracted from these ATAC-seq data allowing reconstruction of regulatory networks.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATAC-seq enables epigenomic analysis on clinical timescales</head><p><s>Because ATAC-seq is rapid, information rich, and compatible with small numbers of cells, we reasoned it may serve as a powerful tool for personalized epigenomics in the clinic.</s><s>Specifically, we envision "personal epigenomics" as genome-scale information about chromatin generated from an individual from a standard clinical sample in a clinical timescale.</s><s>We applied ATAC-seq to assay the personal T-cell epigenome of a healthy volunteer via standard serial blood draws, to demonstrate a workflow capable of generating ATAC-seq libraries in clinical timescales.</s><s>Using rapid T-cell enrichment and sample handling protocols (see Methods), the total required time from blood draw to sequencing was approximately 275 minutes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>When coupled with ongoing improvements to sequencing and analysis turn-around times, we envision ATAC-seq will offer the possibility of a daily turn-around time for a personal epigenomic map.</s><s>To explore this possibility, we performed ATAC-seq on three consecutive days via standard blood draws from a single individual (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>As an exercise to consider how personal epigenomic maps may contain personalized regulatory information, we investigated ATAC-seq profile at the IL2 locus.</s></p><p><s>IL-2 is a key cytokine that drives T-cell growth and functions in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, distinct drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> inhibit the activities of different transcription factors that bind putative IL2 enhancers in a context-dependent manner.</s><s>In principle, one might wish to identify the causal transcription factor pathway in order to rationally target inhibition without exposing the patient to drugs unlikely to serve the therapeutic goal of IL-2 blockade.</s><s>ATAC-seq shows that in the proband's T-cells, only NFAT, but not two other drug targets, is engaging IL2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>), providing clinically relevant information on the regulatory state of this individual.</s></p><p><s>Using ATAC-seq footprints we generated the occupancy profiles of 89 transcription factors in proband T-cells, enabling systematic reconstruction of regulatory networks.</s><s>With this personalized regulatory map, we compared the genomic distribution of the same 89 transcription factors between GM12878 and proband CD4+ T-cells.</s><s>Transcription factors that exhibit large variation in distribution between T-cells and B-cells are enriched for T-cell specific factors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>).</s><s>This analysis shows NFAT is differentially regulating, while canonical CTCF occupancy is highly correlated within these two cell types (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>).</s><s>Supporting this interpretation, we note specific loci where NFAT is localized nearby to known T-cell specific genes such as CD28 and a novel lincRNA RP11-229C3.2 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, ATAC-seq of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, and monocytes isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from a single blood draw created an interpretative framework for the personal epigenomes, and demonstrated that ATAC-seq is compatible with cellular enrichment using surface markers (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>).</s><s>Separately, allele-specific chromatin accessibility has been shown to be particularly relevant to our understanding of human disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>As a proof of principle we also used ATAC-seq to identify candidate allele-specific open chromatin regions within the GM12878 cell line (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>).</s><s>These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating detailed personalized gene regulatory networks from clinical samples, opening the door for future diagnostic applications.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Epigenomic studies of chromatin accessibility have yielded tremendous biological insights, but are currently limited in application by their complex workflows and large cell number requirements.</s><s>While, improvements of existing methods may enable them to reach the similar performance, we believe ATAC-seq offers substantial advantages over existing technologies due to its speed, simplicity, and low input cell number requirement.</s><s>ATAC-seq is an information rich assay, allowing simultaneous interrogation of factor occupancy, nucleosome positions in regulatory sites, and chromatin accessibility genome-wide.</s><s>These insights are derived from both the position of insertion and the distribution of insert lengths captured during the transposition reaction.</s><s>While extant methods such as DNase-and MNase-seq can provide some subsets of the information in ATAC-seq, they each require separate assays with large cell numbers, which increases the time, cost, and limits applicability to many systems.</s><s>ATAC-seq also provides insert size "fingerprints" of biologically relevant genomic regions, suggesting that it capture information on chromatin compaction.</s><s>We expect ATAC-seq to have broad applicability, significantly add to the genomics toolkit, and improve our understanding of gene regulation, particularly when integrated with other powerful rare cell techniques, such as FACS, laser capture microdissection (LCM) and recent advancements in RNA-seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>One potentially exciting application of ATAC-seq is to generate "personal epigenomic" profiles on a timescale compatible with clinical decision-making.</s><s>We have optimized procedures to transform a clinical blood sample to completed sequencing library in 275 minutes.</s><s>The reduced input requirements and rapid workflows, when coupled with the recent introduction of rapid-turnaround high-throughput sequencing instruments, such as the MiSeq and HiSeq2500, will enable investigation of personalized epigenetic landscapes of selected tissues both in the lab and the clinic.</s><s>Of course, deeper analyses to generate global regulatory networks and other inferences will take additional time, and we anticipate that bioinformatic analyses-not the molecular biology or sequencing-will become the bottleneck of epigenomic studies in the future.</s><s>We show that ATAC-seq is compatible with FACS, enabling studies on carefully sorted and rare subpopulations from primary tissues.</s><s>We expect cellular subpopulations selected at different points in development and aging, and human diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and neuropsychiatric disorders are viable applications.</s><s>In summary, we believe that the attractive combination of speed, simplicity and low input requirements of ATAC-seq will enable new gene regulatory insights into biology and medicine.</s></p></div>

Prepare nuclei: To prepare nuclei, we spun 50,000 cells at 500 × g for 5 minutes, followed by a wash using 50 μL of cold 1x PBS and centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 minutes.</s><s>Cells were lysed using cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630).</s><s>Immediately after lysis, nuclei were spun at 500 × g for 10 minutes using a refrigerated centrifuge.</s><s>To avoid losing cells during the nuclei prep, we used a fixed angle centrifuge and carefully pipetted away from the pellet after centrifugations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Transpose and purify:</head><p><s>Immediately following the nuclei prep, the pellet was resuspended in the transposase reaction mix (25 μL 2x TD buffer, 2.5 μL Transposase (Illumina) and 22.5 μL of nuclease free water).</s><s>The transposition reaction was carried out for 30 minutes at 37 °C.</s><s>Directly following transposition the sample was purified using a Qiagen Minelute kit.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PCR:</head><p><s>Following purification, we amplified library fragments using 1x NEBnext PCR master mix and 1.25 μM of custom Nextera PCR primers 1 and 2 (see table below), using the following PCR conditions: 72°C for 5 minutes, 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by thermocycling at 98°C for 10 seconds, 63°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 1 minute.</s><s>To reduce GC and size bias in our PCR we monitored the PCR reaction using qPCR in order to stop amplification prior to saturation.</s><s>To do this, we amplified the full libraries for 5 cycles, after 5 cycles we took an aliquot of the PCR reaction and added 10 μl of the PCR cocktail with Sybr Green at a final concentration of 0.6x.</s><s>We ran this reaction for 20 cycles, to determine the additional number of cycles needed for the remaining 45 μL reaction.</s><s>The libraries were purified using a Qiagen PCR cleanup kit yielding a final library concentration of ~30 nM in 20 μL.</s><s>Libraries were amplified for a total of 10-12 cycles.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low cell number protocol</head><p><s>To prepare the 500 and 5,000 cell reactions we used the same protocol with some notable exceptions: The transposition reaction was done in a 5 μL instead of 50 μL reaction.</s><s>Also, we eliminated the Qiagen Minelute purification prior to PCR and instead took the 5 μL reaction immediately after transposition directly into the 50 μL PCR.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Library QC and quantitation</head><p><s>During the ATAC-seq protocol, we chose to avoid a size selection step to maximize the library complexity.</s><s>The sequenced insert size is a distribution between 40 to 1 kb with a mean of ~120 bps.</s><s>From bioanalyzer and gels we observed fragments &gt;2 kb, which would make Qubit and other mass-based quantitation methods hard to interpret.</s><s>For this reason we quantified our libraries using qPCR based methods.</s></p></div>
