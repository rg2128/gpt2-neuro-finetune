<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mosquitoes</head><p><s>The semi-field assays were conducted using laboratory-reared An. gambiae s.s., which had originally been obtained from Njagi village in Kilombero district, southern Tanzania.</s><s>This colony had originally been established in 1997, but was recently restocked in 2008.</s><s>The mosquito larvae were fed on TetraminH fish food and maintained at a temperature of 2761uC.</s><s>The adult mosquitoes were kept inside a separate room, where temperatures were maintained at 27uC and relative humidity at 70-90% and were fed on 10% glucose solution.</s><s>To sustain the colony, the adult female mosquitoes were fed also on human blood (by way of adult volunteers regularly inserting their arms inside the mosquito cages for 5-10 minutes every two days).</s><s>The insectary was set to a photoperiod of 12 hours darkness and 12 hours light.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Semi-Field System</head><p><s>All behavioral assays aimed at the formulation and optimization of the synthetic odor blend were conducted within a semi-field enclosure (screen house), at the Ifakara Health Institute <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>The screen house has three 200 m 2 compartments, one of which was used for this research.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formulation and Optimization of the Synthetic Odor Blend</head><p><s>The blend was developed through a sequential procedure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), starting with a weakly attractive primary mixture consisting of 2.5% ammonia solution and 500 ml/min of CO 2 gas.</s><s>Onto this primary mixture, L-lactic acid was first added followed by the other aliphatic carboxylic acids initially one at a time to determine their optimal concentrations, and then jointly at their optimal concentrations to create the final blend.</s><s>Whenever each of the candidate compounds were added, we iteratively varied its concentrations until the point when the resulting mixture was maximally competitive, in terms of its attractiveness to laboratory reared mosquitoes relative to the original mixture.</s><s>This final concentration was considered the optimum for each respective candidate compound.</s></p><p><s>L-Lactic acid was the first to be added onto the primary mixture.</s><s>The treatment trap was baited with the primary mixture plus different concentrations of L-lactic acid.</s><s>The control trap on the other hand was baited with only the primary mixture.</s><s>For each concentration of L-lactic acid, four replicates were conducted each lasting six hours, and between which we rotated the positions of the traps so as to minimize directional bias.</s><s>The most significant improvement in attractiveness was determined to occur when Llactic acid was added at 85% concentration (which was the undiluted formulation of L-lactic acid as purchased from the manufacturer).</s><s>The process began with a weakly attractive mixture containing 2.5% aqueous ammonia and CO 2 gas flowing at 500 ml/min, which was enhanced by adding 85% L-lactic acid (LA).</s><s>Onto the resulting mixture, each of the other aliphatic carboxylic acids was added separately, each of them at their optimally attractive concentrations.</s><s>The blend therefore consisted of the CO 2 gas plus hydrous solutions of ammonia (2.5%) and L-lactic acid (85%), and the other aliphatic carboxylic acids at their respective optimum concentrations as follows: propionic acid (C3) at 0.1%, butanoic acid (C4) at 1%, pentanoic acid (C5) at 0.01%, 3-methylbutanoic acid (3mC4) at 0.001%, heptanoic acid (C7) at 0.01%, octanoic acid (C8) at 0.01% and tetradecanoic acid (C14) at 0.01%.</s><s>Finally, a variant of the blend was formulated by removing 3mC4.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008951.g001</s></p><p><s>Previously, the synergistic effect of L-lactic acid when combined with ammonia and a blend of carboxylic acids, has been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore in the rest of our assays, all other aliphatic carboxylic acids were all tested in combination with 85% L-lactic acid, each time comparing the resulting mixture with the original mixture as before.</s><s>In the case of these other carboxylic acids, the treatment trap was therefore baited with: 1) the primary mixture, 2) undiluted L-lactic acid and 3) an iteratively selected concentration of a selected carboxylic acid, while the control trap was baited with only the primary mixture.</s><s>For each carboxylic acid, the optimal concentration was determined by iterating until the point when the resulting mixture was maximally attractive relative to the primary mixture.</s></p><p><s>After the optimal concentrations for all the carboxylic acids had been determined, all the compounds were added to the primary mixture at those respective concentrations to form the final synthetic odor blend.</s><s>The synthetic blend therefore consisted of CO 2 gas flowing at 500 ml/min plus hydrous solutions of ammonia (2.5%), L-lactic acid (85%), and the other aliphatic carboxylic acids: propionic acid (C3) at 0.1%, butanoic acid (C4) at 1%, pentanoic acid (C5) at 0.01%, 3-methylbutanoic acid (3mC4) at 0.001%, heptanoic acid (C7) at 0.01%, octanoic acid (C8) at 0.01% and tetradecanoic acid (C14) at 0.01%.</s><s>Finally, a variant of the blend was formulated by removing the unpleasant smelling 3mC4 in an attempt to improve the appeal of the blend to potential users.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semi-Field Experiment Conducted to Compare the Attractiveness of the Synthetic Odor Blend with the Attractiveness of Natural Host Odors</head><p><s>The blend was first tested against a combination of CO 2 gas and natural human foot odors collected in worn nylon socks, a technique previously used to trap An. gambiae s.s in a similar semifield system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>To collect the foot odors, the nylon socks were worn for 10 hours by a 26 year old male volunteer prior to the experiment.</s><s>Binary tests were conducted in which one trap was baited with the synthetic blend and the other trap baited with a worn nylon sock and 500 ml/min of CO 2 .</s><s>Fourteen replicates, each lasting six hours, were conducted, swapping the positions of the two traps between replicates.</s><s>The proportion of all responding mosquitoes that were caught in either trap was used to determine the attractiveness of the blend relative to the attractiveness of worn nylon sock plus CO 2 (File S1).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field Experiments Conducted to Evaluate the Blend against Wild Mosquitoes</head><p><s>Study village.</s><s>The field study was conducted in Lupiro Village (8.01uS and 36.63uE),</s><s>Ulanga District, in the south eastern part of Tanzania.</s><s>The village lies 300 metres above sea level, and experiences very high malaria transmission, recently reported to average approximately 400 infectious bites per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Ethics statement.</s><s>After a full explanation of the risks involved and the objectives of the study, written informed consent was obtained from the volunteers, all of whom were male and aged between 20 to 34 years old.</s><s>When inside the huts during the experimental nights, all volunteers slept under bed nets and were guaranteed immediate access to treatment including weekly screening for malaria parasites by light microscopy and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine; however no participant was affected during the study.</s><s>Ethical approval for the study was obtained from Medical Research Coordination Committee of the National Institute for Medical Research of the United Republic of Tanzania (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/710).</s></p><p><s>Comparing the number of mosquitoes that enter huts baited with the synthetic blend versus number of mosquitoes that enter huts in which there are human volunteers.</s><s>To compare the synthetic odor blend with whole humans under epidemiologically relevant conditions, and determine whether wild mosquitoes would also be attracted to this it, field experiments were conducted in which the blend was compared with 10 different adult male volunteers (20-34 years old).</s><s>We used 4 specially-designed experimental huts (Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>) located 10 to 100 metres apart in a malaria-endemic village in rural Tanzania.</s><s>The experimental huts were located at the edge of the village, so that they were between the main breeding grounds (a perennial rice field) and the human houses, and also so that they were at least 50 metres away from the nearest human house.</s><s>Each night, 2 human volunteers slept under non-insecticidal bed nets inside 2 separate huts.</s><s>In the third hut, the synthetic odor blend was dispensed by evaporation in a continuous air plume, also from under a non-insecticidal bed net.</s><s>The fourth hut had a variant of this blend which lacked one constituent, 3-methyl-butanoic acid (3mC4).</s><s>This constituent was the most unpleasant smelling, so it was expected that its exclusion would improve the acceptability of the odor blend.</s><s>The blend and its variant were dispensed using nylon strips inserted in the attractant plume tube of an MM-XH trap (a counter flow geometry trap made by American Biophysics Corporation) and CO 2 gas was added to the trap using rubber tubing (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1-S3</ref>).</s><s>This odor dispensing method has been described in detail in Okumu et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In these field tests, the MM-XH was used only to dispense the blend but not to trap mosquitoes; its collection tube was closed and the exhausted fan disabled so as to eliminate suction.</s><s>Instead, a different trap, the Centres for Disease Control Light Trap (CDC-LT), was set up in all the experimental huts to catch mosquitoes that enter.</s><s>The light traps were placed beside the bed nets (from under which the odor cues from human or blend were emanating), such that it was one metre from the floor.</s><s>To minimize any positional bias, the set up was rotated nightly so that at the end of a four-day rotation, the blend, its variant, and each volunteer had been to every hut.</s><s>Also by the end of each rotation, the blend and its variant had been tested against humans four different times.</s></p><p><s>Then a new pair of volunteers was recruited and the test repeated for another four nights.</s><s>This way, the blend and its variant were each tested against 10 different humans (5 pairs) over 20 different nights.</s><s>All experiments were conducted between 7.00pm to 7.00am, during which time mosquitoes entering the huts were trapped;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p><s>Data from the semi-field experiments were analyzed by logistic regression using SPSS version 15 (SPSS Inc, Chicago).</s><s>With regards to the data from the field experiments, we compared the arithmetic means of all the mosquito catches per hut per night and illustrated these using simple bar graphs with error bars showing 95% confidence intervals.</s><s>Further analysis was conducted using General Linear Models (GLM) as follows as follows: Mosquito catches were modelled as a function of two fixed factors, bait and hut, treating day as a random variable to reflect daily fluctuations in mosquito numbers.</s><s>Also, due to the heterogeneity of the mosquito counts, the data was log transformed to make it amenable to assumptions of the standard normal distribution.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>High-throughput determination of optimal concentrations of individual candidate attractants was successfully achieved through the binary choice assays in the semi-field enclosure.</s><s>These were the concentrations at which the individual candidate attractants needed to be added so as to obtain a blend maximally attractive to laboratory-reared An. gambiae s.s.</s><s>When the resulting blend was tested within the semi-field enclosure against a combination of natural human foot odors collected in worn nylon socks and CO 2 gas, it caught 46.5% (38.0%-55.9%) of all responding mosquitoes, indicating no difference between the two odor sources (P = 0.408).</s></p><p><s>In the field experiments conducted to compare our synthetic blend with humans, more mosquitoes were trapped inside the huts with either variant of the synthetic blend than inside the huts in which human volunteers slept (F = 66.025,</s><s>P,0.001).</s><s>With or without 3mC4, the blend attracted approximately 3.9 times more An.</s><s>gambiae sensu lato (morphologically indistinguishable members of the species complex of which An. gambiae is a member), 3.1 times more An.</s><s>funestus, 5.2 times more of other Anopheles species, 4.2 times more Culex mosquitoes and 2.7 times more Mansonia mosquitoes than an average human volunteer (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In the other separate experiment, where the full blend was placed inside the same huts occupied by human volunteers, the number of mosquitoes of any species entering those huts was increased compared to huts in which there were only human volunteers.</s><s>There were 2.6 times more An.</s><s>gambiae s.l, 5.5 times more Culex and 4.6 times more Mansonia mosquitoes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A</ref>).</s><s>However, once the mosquitoes had entered the huts, significantly more An.</s><s>gambiae s.l.</s><s>(P,0.001),</s><s>Culex (P = 0.045) and Mansonia mosquitoes (P,0.001) were attracted to the humans than to the synthetic blend and similar but non-significant trends were observed for An.</s><s>funestus (P = 0.179) and the assortment of other Anopheles mosquitoes (P = 0.82) present in the study village (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Molecular identification of An. gambiae s.l.</s><s>mosquitoes caught in the experiment described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> showed that 97.8% (405/414) were An.</s><s>arabiensis, with the remainder being An.</s><s>gambiae s.s., and this proportion did not vary with bait type (F = 2.96, P = 0.53).</s><s>Furthermore, unlike previous blends tested in Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the proportions of mosquitoes caught which were accounted for by the various mosquito taxa were essentially identical to those obtained with human baits (x 2 = 2.94, P = 0.938), so these synthetic lures appear to representatively sample a wide range of human-biting mosquitoes with high sensitivity (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study greatly improves upon some of the recent successes with odor based technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and therefore represents a significant advancement in attempts to develop synthetic lures, which would effectively compete against humans for host seeking mosquitoes in actual field settings.</s><s>Similar to previous field evaluations of synthetic blends for attracting Aedes aegypti, the principle vector of yellow fever and dengue <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, and Anopheles gambiae, the most important vector of malaria globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, our findings confirm that it is possible to formulate synthetic odor blends which attract as many mosquitoes as human odors, even without including all the biologically active components naturally found in the human emanations.</s><s>In this study, we did not assume that a 'surrogate human' would consist of only the few compounds that we included.</s><s>Instead, we expect that it would be possible to improve upon this simple mixture of carboxylic acids, ammonia and carbon dioxide by adding other attractants from different chemical groups, for example ketones and aldehydes, as well as physical cues such as heat and color.</s></p><p><s>Also, it appears that similar to results of previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, preferences of mosquitoes towards any one of two different stimuli are dependent upon distances between those stimuli, i.e. whether the stimuli are in direct short range competition or whether they are far apart and have completely separated odor plumes (so that they are not perceived by the host seeking mosquitoes as two competing odour sources).</s><s>Whereas huts baited with the synthetic blend or its variant had more mosquitoes than those huts with humans, many of the vectors when presented with the two odor sources side by side within the same hut appeared to retain their preferences for humans.</s><s>On the basis of this observation and also because the experimental huts were located 10-100 metres apart, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Long range performance of the synthetic blend and its variant.</s><s>Average number of mosquitoes caught per night, inside experimental huts whenever the blend, its variant (without 3-methyl butanoic acid) or a human volunteer was inside the hut.</s><s>There were significantly more mosquitoes caught in huts baited with the blend or its variant than in huts baited with humans (P,0.001) as determined by General Linear Model using SPSS version 15 (SPSS Inc.).</s><s>However, no difference was observed between the blend and its variant (P.0.05).</s><s>The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008951.g002</s><s>this synthetic blend may best be described as a medium to long range attractant rather than as a short range attractant <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The particular mosquito species caught in this study included three primary malaria vectors (An.</s><s>gambiae sensu stricto, An. arabiensis and An.</s><s>funestus) as well as carriers of Bancroftian filariasis and several arboviruses (Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, Cx. univattus, Cx. theileri, Cx.</s><s>Rubinotus and Mansonia africana), all of which are common and relevant across Africa (Ogoma et al., Unpublished).</s><s>Therefore, although the synthetic blend was originally optimized using only laboratory-reared An. gambiae sensu stricto, it can be considered a general attractant that is equally effective for use against a range of other important human-biting mosquito species in the field.</s></p><p><s>This highly attractive and broad spectrum odor blend has many potential applications because it can substitute for human subjects as baits in mosquito traps, or as decoy hosts to lure away mosquitoes which would otherwise bite and possibly transmit pathogens to humans.</s><s>The availability of such a consistent and effective bait for representative sampling a wide range of hostseeking mosquitoes means that it should be possible to measure human exposure to mosquito-borne infections without the need for human volunteers.</s><s>The necessity to use human volunteers as baits in mosquito traps inevitably limits their compactness, consistency, cost and safety, and has restricted the development of sustainable mosquito surveillance systems, especially in resource-limited countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The attractants might also be applied for mass trapping of mosquitoes so as to reduce, rather than merely monitor, transmission of the various pathogens that the mosquitoes carry.</s><s>Such mass trapping operations would simultaneously suppress nuisance bites from abundant Culicine mosquito species, thereby enhancing community uptake of such technologies.</s><s>Another potential application of this odor blend is to combine them with existing malaria control tools using push-pull strategies similar to those commonly practiced in agricultural pest management <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>For example, where people use insecticide treated nets (ITNs) or indoor residual spraying with insecticides (IRS) which apart from being lethal targets also deter mosquitoes from entering houses, odor baited traps could be strategically located so as to trap the mosquitoes deterred from dwellings.</s><s>Similarly, this odor blend could be used to lure host-seeking vectors to lethal outdoor targets such as surfaces treated with insecticides, a strategy that has been successfully applied to control tsetse flies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One priority area for application of this or similar lures would be for malaria control, where there is currently an over-reliance on insecticide-based and intra-domiciliary methods, specifically ITNs and IRS.</s><s>Mathematical simulations using adaptations of established transmission models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, suggest that appropriate trap devices baited with these lures could reduce exposure to malaria, and effectively complement ITNs in areas of highly intense malaria transmission in Africa <ref type="bibr">(Okumu et al., Unpublished)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The fact that this synthetic blend greatly increased mosquito densities inside huts, yet humans sleeping in those huts remained equally or more attractive to the mosquitoes, necessitates careful consideration of safety and ethics whenever this or similar longrange attractants are used.</s><s>Trap devices containing these blends should not be positioned in or near human habitations because this can increase exposure to mosquito bites and mosquito-borne pathogens.</s><s>Our observations, combined with measurements of the attractive range of mammalian hosts to mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, imply that such devices must be located at least 30 meters away from human houses, a concept which can actually be exploited by Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>Proportions of various mosquito taxa making up the total mosquito catches in experimental huts baited with the blend, its variant (without 3-methylbutanoic acid) or humans.</s><s>mosquito control programs to target specific areas where mosquitoes are most abundant, notably the periphery of human settlements, thus enhancing impacts of such programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>The observation that the blend acts at medium-to-long range also suggests that optimization of behaviorally active formulations in even larger semi-field systems, followed by both short-range and long-range choice tests in the field, could accelerate and enhance the development of even more potent synthetic lures.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>We conclude that this synthetic odor blend has potential to be used for reproducible and exposure-free sampling of human-biting mosquitoes and also might be developed into high-impact, environmentally-friendly interventions against mosquitoes and diseases that they transmit.</s><s>Added advantages of such technologies would include possibilities to target mosquitoes that bite outdoors or early in the evening before people go to bed and even diurnal vectors such as Aedes aegypti that often attack their victims far away from their houses <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, because of the intimate dependence of mosquitoes upon their specialized host-seeking behaviors to obtain blood and survive, it is unlikely that odorbased technologies would be affected by physiological resistance among mosquitoes, as is common with insecticide based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p></div>
