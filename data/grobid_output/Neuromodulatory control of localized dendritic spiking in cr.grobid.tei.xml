changes in spontaneous responses as a function of locomotion and age were not measurably different (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Emergent from these measures is a hypothesis in which cholinergic enhancement of SST cell activity during the critical period drives branch-specific dendritic activity and disinhibition in pyramidal cells.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we artificially enhanced SST cell activity in adult cortex, where SST activity is relatively lower than during the critical period, and examined the impact on dendritic and somatic activity.</s><s>In control studies in which SST cells expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2), blue light pulses of 10 ms duration at 15 Hz reliably drove SST cell responses (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>With this established, we expressed ChR2 in SST cells and GCaMP6f in pyramidal neurons in adult mice to determine if optogenetic stimulation of SST cells impacted dendritic responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>).</s><s>Evoked activities of sister dendrites were recorded across periods of movement and rest to obtain a baseline level of dendritic activity and sister branch covariance.</s><s>Under baseline conditions, sister dendrites in adult cortex behaved as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>: calcium responses increased during periods of movement, and stimulation did not affect overall activity levels (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>).</s><s>However, upon optogenetic stimulation of SST cells, branch-specific dendritic activity reemerged, though only when mice were running (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>; see discussion).</s><s>Responses of pyramidal cell somas were also elevated over baseline during SST stimulation and running (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4e-g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To explore whether enhanced SST cell activity seen at P28 impacts critical period plasticity in the typically developing cortex, we chronically suppressed SST cell activity during the critical period via hM4Di-DREADD receptors and measured the effect on the emergence of binocularly-matched receptive field tuning in pyramidal neurons -the most salient consequence of critical period plasticity in the visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>In SST cells expressing DREADD receptors, intraperitoneal injection of CNO (2.5 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction in evoked amplitude over an 8-hour timespan (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>In mice with DREADDs selectively expressed in SST cells and GCaMP6f in pyramidal neurons, we administered CNO from P24 through P27 and then measured binocular neuron tuning in the orientation and spatial frequency domains at P28. Tuning of contralateral inputs was unaffected by SST suppression, but inferred spike rates increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a-c</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, ipsilateral eye inputs were degraded by both measures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5d-f</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, receptive field tuning between contralateral and ipsilateral inputs was poorly matched (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5g-h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The data we present here reveal a transient circuit linking cholinergic neuromodulation and inhibition, which act in unison with vision to shape cortical circuitry during the critical period.</s><s>In this circuit, acetylcholine released from basal forebrain into cortex during periods of heightened arousal directly activates SST cells, resulting in branch-specific dendritic inhibition and somatic disinhibition -two hallmarks of cortical plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Th</s><s> presence of local calcium activity within functionally distinct dendritic compartments and enhanced somatic spiking may be the substrate through which sensory experience engages plasticity in the very young cortex.</s><s>The engagement of these components is distinct from adult cortex, where these properties emerge during learning and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> -states that involve attention and reinforcement.</s></p><p><s>Notably, direct stimulation of SST cells in adult cortex was not sufficient to drive an increase in branch-specific dendritic activity and somatic spiking.</s><s>These events only occurred when SST stimulation was concurrent with running.</s><s>One possibility is that acetylcholine acts in parallel on SST cells and pyramidal cells to evoke compartmentalized dendritic plasticity in the developing cortex.</s><s>Local dendritic activity, backpropagations, and acetylcholine combined have powerful implications for inducing plasticity within specific dendritic compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and could strengthen initially weak inputs in developing cortex.</s><s>The loss of the cholinergic co-activation of excitatory cells and SST-mediated inhibition would shift plasticity rules, in which inhibition becomes inverted along the somatodendritic axis, and may play a role in the closure of the critical period.</s></p></div>
