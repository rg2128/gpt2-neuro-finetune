<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The acquisition of olfactory information and its early processing in mammals are modulated by brain states through sniffing behavior and neural feedback.</s><s>We imaged the spatiotemporal pattern of odor-evoked activity in a population of output neurons (mitral/tufted cells, MTCs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) of head-restrained mice expressing a genetically-encoded calcium indicator.</s><s>The temporal dynamics of MTC population activity were relatively simple in anesthetized animals, but were highly variable in awake animals.</s><s>However, the apparently irregular activity in awake animals could be predicted well using sniff timing measured externally, or inferred through fluctuations in the global responses of MTC population even without explicit knowledge of sniff times.</s><s>The overall spatial pattern of activity was conserved across states, but odor responses had a diffuse spatial component in anesthetized mice that was less prominent during wakefulness.</s><s>Multi-photon microscopy indicated that MTC lateral dendrites were the likely source of spatially disperse responses in the anesthetized animal.</s><s>Our data demonstrate that the temporal and spatial dynamics of MTCs can be significantly modulated by behavioral state, and that the ensemble activity of MTCs can provide information about sniff timing to downstream circuits to help decode odor responses.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUBJECTS</head><p><s>For most of our experiments, we used Kv3.1-GCaMP2 mice, in which GCaMP2 expression is driven by a promoter fragment from the Kv3.1 potassium channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Diez-Garcia et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies have found that the expression of GCaMP2 in these mice is confined largely to mitral and tufted cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fletcher et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Data from nine adult (50-120 days old) mice were used for analysis (six for widefield, three for multiphoton).</s><s>We also used four adult (p60) OMP-synaptopHluorin mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bozza et al., 2004)</ref> for some experiments.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HEADPLATE AND SNIFF CANNULA IMPLANTATION SURGERY</head><p><s>The initial surgery consisted of two stages performed in one session.</s><s>The first was to implant the headplate and the second to implant a cannula used for sniff measurements.</s><s>Adult male Kv3.1-GCaMP2 mice (50-120 days old) were anesthetized with a Ketamine/Xylazine (100 mg/kg:10 mg/kg, i.p., Webster) mixture and set on a stereotactic mouse holder.</s><s>Body temperature was monitored with an external probe placed under the abdomen and maintained at 37 • C with a homeothermic heating blanket (507220F, Harvard Apparatus).</s><s>The scalp was retracted to expose the skull.</s><s>After thorough cleaning and drying of the skull, a thin layer of cyanoacrylic adhesive (Vetbond, 3M) was applied to the skull and surrounding skin.</s><s>Finally, a custom cut titanium headplate <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wienisch et al., 2012)</ref> was attached using acrylic cement (Jet Repair, Lang Dental).</s><s>After the acrylic adhesive hardened (approximately 20 min), the sniff cannula implantation surgery was started.</s><s>The area of the skull above the right nasal cavity and immediately anterior to the head-plate was thinned and removed.</s><s>The epithelium was then punctured with a thin needle.</s><s>After widening the hole and drying the cavity by removing blood and mucus, a short piece of medical tubing (#425415, BD Intramedic) was placed on top of the skull, aligned over the hole, and fixed with the acrylic cement.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HEAD-FIXATION TRAINING</head><p><s>To minimize motion artifacts during imaging sessions, animals were trained to remain on a custom-built head-fixation setup.</s><s>Adapting the methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dombeck et al. (2007)</ref>, animals were placed on a styrofoam wheel (8 diameter, 4 wide, Smoothfoam, Plasteel Corp).</s><s>The center of the wheel was pierced with a 2 mm diameter steel rod acting as an axle, and this axle was mounted to posts damped by soft springs.</s><s>This method offered the animals' forward and backward freedom of motion while preventing uncontrolled lateral motion that a styrofoam ball may have <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wienisch et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Training was started 48 h after headplate implantation surgery.</s><s>Animals were acclimated to being placed on the wheel for short periods of time for multiple sessions daily.</s><s>To further enhance animal place preference, animals were water restricted when not on the wheel and given 10% sucrose water ad libitum while on the wheel.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WIDE-FIELD IMAGING</head><p><s>Ketamine-Xylazine (100 mg/kg: 10 mg/kg, i.p.) was used to anesthetize animals for the "anesthetized" imaging trials.</s><s>The OB was visualized using a custom-built microscope outfitted with a 10X objective (UPLFLN 10X, Olympus America).</s><s>GCaMP2 was imaged using excitation light from a blue LED (Luxeon V Star, 470 nm, Philips Lumileds) and a fluorescence filter set (HQ480/40×, Q505LP, HQ510LP, Chroma Technology Corp.).</s><s>A CCD camera (Sensicam HP, Cooke Corp.), binned 8 × 8, was used to image the OB at 33 Hz.</s><s>With the magnification and binning, the image resolution was 6.2 μm per pixel, with an overall image dimension of 990 × 790 μm.</s><s>Image acquisition, synchronized to odor delivery, was performed through customwritten LabView (National Instruments) software.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MULTI-PHOTON IMAGING</head><p><s>A custom-built two-photon (2P) microscope was used for multiphoton imaging experiments.</s><s>The OB was imaged with a water immersion objective (20×, 0.95 NA, Olympus America) at 910 nm using a Ti: Sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Newport Corporation).</s><s>Image acquisition, synchronized to odor delivery, was done through custom-written LabView (National Instruments) software.</s><s>For most experiments, images were obtained with a pixel resolution of 1 μm, with frame rates of 4 Hz.</s><s>For experiments that involved comparisons with sniffing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>, for example), higher frame rates of 8 Hz were used, with a consequent loss in spatial resolution (2 μm).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA ANALYSIS</head><p><s>All data analysis was performed using custom scripts written in Matlab (Mathworks).</s><s>Sniffing signals were processed by mean filtering the raw analog signal and finding the inhalation peaks based on thresholding the slope and raw signal.</s><s>Each trial was individually examined, and false positives and negatives were corrected.</s><s>From the sniff peak data, frequency could be calculated as the inverse of the time between each peak.</s><s>Raw image data were aligned to sniff data using transistor-transistor logic (TTL) signals of exposure times from the camera that was simultaneously collected with sniffing signals.</s><s>The raw image stacks were used to create F (odor signal minus air signal) glomerular response maps.</s><s>Time courses were extracted from the image stacks by selecting responding glomeruli as regions of interest (ROI) and computing the mean fluorescence of the ROI over the course of the trial.</s><s>Many of the anesthetized odor responses contained spatially extensive signals, making it difficult to identify individual glomerular hotspots.</s><s>To better isolate hotspots in anesthetized animals (for visualization), we applied a Gaussian spatial filter with a standard deviation of 50 μm to the response image and subtracted this out.</s><s>Such filtering was not done when we specifically analyzed diffuse responses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PREDICTION ANALYSIS</head><p><s>Each sniff-triggered response (STR) was found by taking the fluorescence time course data surrounding each inhalation peak.</s><s>All of the STRs were then averaged to derive the sniff-triggered average (STA), the shape of the generic response.</s><s>This shape was then scaled to match the amplitude of the first STR of the odor period.</s><s>This scaled STA became the predicted response evoked by a sniff, and at every sniff peak, the STA was added to the prediction time course.</s><s>For added complexity of modeling, we added the decay in response as an additional parameter.</s><s>The actual amplitude of each STR was divided by the amplitude of the first STR.</s><s>This normalized relative amplitude was then used as a lookup table to adjust the individual STR amplitudes as a function of sniff number.</s><s>Beyond 40 sniffs, there was large variability due to small number of events for averaging and we used an extrapolated linear regression as the decay function.</s></p><p><s>To compare the prediction algorithms, we used the Extra Sum of Squares F-test <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Motulsky and Christopoulos, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>We calculated the mean sum of squares of the residuals for each trial.</s><s>The sum of all the mean values became the total sum of squares.</s><s>Degrees of freedom were calculated as the number of trials minus the number of parameters used.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GLOBAL RESPONSE PATTERNS</head><p><s>Glomerular hotspots were chosen for each mouse if they responded to any of the odors in either the anesthetized or awake states.</s><s>These hotspots were then used to create response vectors for each odor, consisting of the F values for each of the hotspots.</s><s>Whole-field correlation studies were done to more objectively analyze global patterns.</s><s>Images were filtered with a circular averaging filter with a 5 μm radius.</s><s>The mean F images in both the anesthetized and awake states were compared by linear correlation.</s><s>In order to account for misalignment of the images, 1600 different cuts were taken, representing 35 μm (20 pixel) shifts in each direction, left, right, up, and down.</s><s>The best correlation was taken to be the best alignment.</s><s>Positive controls were calculated by finding the correlations between trials of the same odor within the anesthetized and awake conditions.</s><s>A negative control was calculated by averaging the correlations between the mean anesthetized F image of a given odor and a mean awake F image of a random different odor.</s><s>The mean correlation coefficients from multiple experiments were compared using a Komogorov-Smirnov test.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIFFUSE RESPONSE</head><p><s>To examine spatially diffuse responses we drew concentric rings of 1.7 μm thickness around the glomerular hotspot and calculated the F within each annulus.</s><s>Points in the concentric rings that overlapped other hotspots were excluded.</s><s>The average F was then plotted as a function of distance from the glomerulus.</s><s>For each trial, an exponential function was fitted, and the decay constant, τ, was calculated.</s><s>The average τ values for anesthetized and awake were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</s><s>Diffuse responses were also assessed by taking a Fourier transform of the F images for each odorant and calculating the power as a function of spatial frequency.</s><s>The relative power in low frequencies (0-2.5 mm -1 ) compared to high frequencies (25-35 mm -1 ) was used as an index of diffuse responses in anesthetized and awake conditions.</s></p></div>
