Previous studies</head><p><s>showed that the ACC can process a visual signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , suggesting that external visual input is a source of persistent neuronal activity during sustained attention.</s><s>To distinguish potential internal and external sources, we manipulated the length of a visual cue of a successful trigger in well-trained rats.</s><s>We alternatively presented either transient or continuous cues, in one of two blocks in each test session (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>).</s><s>If driven by external visual input, neuronal activity in the transient cue block should also be transient.</s><s>We observed no significant difference in terms of accuracy and proportion of premature responses between transient and continued cue blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>).</s><s>However, rats responded more rapidly in transient than in continuous cue blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c</ref>).</s><s>Notably, the percentage of omitted trials in transient blocks was greater than that in continuous blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, loss of the transient signal tended to trigger withdrawal of sustained attention on the stimulus delivery port.</s><s>Moreover, we observed no significant difference in neuronal activity between continuous and transient blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7d-f</ref>): persistent neuronal activity was sustained until rats responded, even if the cue associated with initiation of attention was transient, strongly suggesting that that neuronal activity is not driven by external visual input.</s><s>Further comparison of correct and omitted trials revealed significant differences in neuronal activities during the attention period in correct trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7g</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we developed a task to assess sustained attention in rats in both visual and olfactory modalities based on the widely used 5CSRTT paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Then, using pharmacological lesion experiments, we employed it to assess function of ACC in sustained attention.</s><s>We then recorded neuronal activity in ACC using multichannel extracellular recording techniques.</s><s>The results showed that a group of ACC neurons was persistently activated during the period of attention, suggesting a correlation between ACC neuronal activity and sustainment of attention.</s><s>The following results demonstrated this correlation.</s><s>First, modality of attention target had minimal influence on neuronal activity.</s><s>Second, although the presence distractors during the attention period resulted in a greater number of premature responses and omitted trials, we observed no significant difference in attention-related neuronal activity in terms of accuracy between the presence and absence of distractors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s><s>Third, we demonstrated that persistent activity seen during sustained attention is not driven by sensory input (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, trial-to-trial variability of population activities in the ACC decreased significantly within the attention period, especially in attention-related neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S15</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To clarify the correlation between ACC neuronal activity and sustained attention, we should also eliminate potential psychological interferences including reward expectation, motivation, and working memory.</s><s>In the present task, reward expectation and motivation should be equivalent for correct and incorrect trials and for omitted and correct trials, since the reward amount does not change during testing.</s><s>But the neuronal activity between correct and incorrect trials, as well as omitted and correct trials was significantly different (Figs 3f-h, 6g and 7g).</s><s>Thus, it is unlikely that these differences were due to altered reward expectation and motivation but rather emerged from changes in the psychological state of attention.</s><s>Also, tests of working memory usually employ different objects to memorize in each trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>However, we did not rats to memorize different objects in each trial but rather to recall the task rules.</s><s>Such recall could not be sustained during the entire period of attention and differed in correct and incorrect trials.</s><s>Thus, the present task likely eliminates potential interference by working memory.</s><s>However, attention-related neurons may also be activated or suppressed in other contexts, suggesting that these neurons are active in other states in addition to attention.</s><s>First, neurons inhibited during sustained attention were maximally activated at initiation of reward consumption (Figure <ref type="figure">S8f</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S12f</ref>), suggesting they function in the reward process, in accordance with previous findings that ACC activity is associated with reward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Second, two of three types of activated attention-related neurons identified were activated or suppressed simultaneously with the trigger (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>), suggesting they function in response to the trigger or in initiating attention.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge, ours is the first study to investigate potential effects of target modality on the neural basis of sustained attention.</s><s>We observed that the same neurons participated in both visual and olfactory attention, suggesting a common ACC pathway functioning in sustained attention.</s><s>These findings are consistent with the idea that the attention system enhances all sensory input processing 1 , although deployment of attention is distinct for different targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>During sustained attention in our experimental paradigm, properties of the detected target shaped strategies to detect the stimulus port.</s><s>For example, in the olfactory task, rats were required to put their nose near the delivery site to detect an olfactory stimulus, while rats could detect visual stimuli more rapidly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2b</ref>), likely because they did not need to evaluate stimulus ports one by one.</s><s>Thus, distinct detection strategies may underlie differences in response time between modalities or differences in behavioral performance or neuronal activity.</s><s>However, we found that activity of certain types of ACC neurons did not differ between modalities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), suggestive of common mechanisms related to attention.</s></p><p><s>It should be noted that our lesion results differed in some respects from previous studies.</s><s>First, decreased accuracy resulting from the ACC lesion was temporary (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), although comparable lesion studies of visual attention report long-term deficits in attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Second, here the proportion of premature responses increased following lesioning, but a similar study reported an increase in the proportion of premature responses following lesion of the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and infralimbic cortex (IL) but not after ACC lesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>These differences might be due to differences in the extent or location of lesioned sites: sites in previous studies (AP + 2.2 ~ + 3.2) were approximately two millimeters anterior to lesion sites employed here (AP 0 ~ + 1).</s><s>Also our experimental design differed from previous studies: ours is the first to use a trigger aperture to control the period of sustained attention.</s></p><p><s>It is noteworthy that the decrease in the Fano factor of neuronal activity started about 2 sec before the trigger.</s><s>Here, except for sustained attention, the event sequence and locomotion of animals were comparable across trials, which could also decrease trial-to-trial variability of neuronal activity and lead to a decrease in the Fano factor before the trigger.</s><s>However, the fact that the Fano factor decreased more significantly after rather than before the trigger and then differed significantly between attention-related activated neurons and other neurons suggests that sustained attention correlates with a decrease in the Fano factor.</s></p><p><s>ACC function is extensive and includes affective processing (such as regulation of emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> ), reward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , and representation of both physical <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and social <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> pain.</s><s>The ACC also participates in cognitive control through conflict monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> and error detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> .</s><s>Bush et al. proposed that the ACC is divided into dorsal cognitive and ventral affective subdivisions that interact with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , potentially accounting for the structure's complex function.</s><s>Our results, along with previous studies of ACC function in attention, suggest a slightly different perspective, namely, that both affective and cognitive processing consumes sustained attention, leading to persistent neuronal activity in ACC as a critical part of the attention system.</s></p><p><s>We analyzed neuronal activity in the ACC only.</s><s>However, others note that multiple brain regions function in sustained attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>The ACC is clearly an important component of this network that cooperates with other brain regions to enable sustained attention.</s><s>In fact, a pattern of persistent neuronal activity has been observed in medial prefrontal cortex in tasks of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and waiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , and similar persistent OFC activity is seen in a waiting task <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Also, although our study showed comparable ACC activation in visual and olfactory attention, brain networks underlying sustained attention may differ for particular modalities.</s><s>Therefore, understanding of mechanisms underlying sustained attention requires investigation of attention-related activity in the entire network across modalities.</s></p></div>
