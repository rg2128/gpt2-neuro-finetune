target="#b51">(Squire et al., 2013)</ref>, but it could not be the only source because lesions of the entire dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, including FEF, reduce but do not completely eliminate either the attentional modulation of responses in area V4, or an animal's ability to attend to stimuli in the presence of distracters <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gregoriou et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Another possible source of signals for the attentional modulation of the ventral stream is the pulvinar, which has long been suggested to play an important role in selective

cytoarchitecturally defined sub-nuclei.</s><s>Ventral stream areas V1, V2, V4, and IT cortex have connections with the ventro-lateral portions of the pulvinar, including the inferior pulvinar and ventral parts of the lateral pulvinar <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Soares et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Shipp, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kaas and Lyon, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gattass et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Cells in layers 5 and 6 of these cortical visual areas project topographically to the pulvinar, which in turn projects mainly back to the superficial layers of these areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sherman and Guillery, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Shipp, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Such a cortex-thalamus-cortex pathway could be consistent with either a role in attention or in the relay of sensory information from one area to another <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Purushothaman et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This "ventral-stream" portion of the pulvinar also has connections with other parts of the attentional control network.</s><s>The inferior pulvinar receives inputs from the superior colliculus (SC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Benevento and Standage, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Berman and Wurtz, 2010)</ref>, which has functions in oculomotor control and attention.</s><s>There are no direct connections between the ventro-lateral pulvinar and parietal or prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baizer et al., 1993)</ref>, but the entire pulvinar receives GABA-ergic inputs from the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, which itself receives converging input from many different cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Zikopoulos and

2009)</ref>.</s><s>However, it would take more detailed analyses of causal influences to distinguish whether the pulvinar is a cause of attention modulation in visual cortex or simply mirrors its cortical input.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Saalman et al (2012)</ref> conducted a Granger causality analysis of pulvinar interactions with the visual cortex during the delay period following an attentional cue.</s><s>They suggested that the pulvinar synchronizes cortical activity at alpha frequencies following the cue, thereby regulating the transmission of information from one cortical area to another according to attentional demands.</s><s>However, the role of neural synchronization in the processing of the attended stimulus was not clear in that study.</s><s>Large alpha synchrony has

studies have all involved the more dorsal portions of the pulvinar with parietal connections, and one lesion study confined to the ventro-lateral pulvinar found no effects on attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bender and Butter, 1987)</ref>.</s><s>By combining pulvinar deactivation with cortical recording, <ref type="bibr">Purushothamanet al. (2012)</ref> found that deactivation of the pulvinar eliminated visual responses in the superficial layers of V1 in anesthetized Galagos, and <ref type="bibr">Soares et al. (2004)</ref> found mixed positive and negative effects on responses in V2 following pulvinar deactivation in anesthetized new world Cebus monkeys.</s><s>Although the differences in results are puzzling, together they suggest a possible role of the pulvinar in cortical visual processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sherman and Guillery, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, the effects of pulvinar deactivation on attentive visual processing in the cortex have never been investigated in awake monkeys.</s></p><p><s>To further understand the functions of the pulvinar-cortex loop, we recorded simultaneously in the pulvinar and V4 and IT cortex of monkeys performing a spatial attention task.</s><s>We first tested the synchronous interactions between the pulvinar and visual cortex in normally awake state.</s><s>We found that cells in the pulvinar had properties similar to those of cells in the cortical areas projecting to them, but the effects of attention were weaker and later than those in V4.</s><s>Gamma frequency synchrony between V4 and the pulvinar was enhanced by attention, but this synchrony was led by V4.</s><s>Likewise, we found for the first time that gamma spike-field synchrony between V4 and IT cortex was also enhanced by attention and led by V4.</s><s>Thus, neuronal properties in the pulvinar seem to reflect its cortical input.</s><s>Next, we inactivated the ventro-lateral pulvinar and simultaneously recorded in V4 and IT, which allowed us to test for the first time the causal influence of the pulvinar on cortical processing in awake monkeys.</s><s>The animals were significantly impaired in the task in the affected portion of the visual field.</s><s>The effects of attention on V4 responses were greatly reduced.</s><s>However, visual responses in V4 were also reduced even below the level of response normally found without attention, suggesting that the pulvinar is essential for normal visual processing in cortex as well.</s><s>V4 showed a large increase in low frequency (0.5-20 Hz) power in the LFP following pulvinar deactivation, almost as if the affected part of the cortex went into a state of "sleep".</s><s>Thus, the return inputs from pulvinar to the cortex seem necessary to keep the cortex in a normally active state.</s></p></div>

(2012)</ref> based on DTI connectivity.</s><s>Using structural MRI imaging, we first targeted this general region known to have V4 connections, and then we used RF mapping to identify the subregion representing the contralateral lower visual field, overlapping the RFs of the V4 recording sites.</s><s>For simplicity, we will refer to the region with V4 connections as simply "pulvinar" unless indicated otherwise.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> shows a representative MRI section through the pulvinar and a track of an electrode.</s><s>The representative MRI image from another monkey and estimated pulvinar recording sites in the two monkeys are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>.</s><s>In V4, we targeted areas on the prelunate gyrus where neurons had RFs in the lower contralateral visual field at an eccentricity of about 5-7deg (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1a</ref>).</s><s>The IT recording sites were located in the mid-portion of IT cortex, in both the lower bank of the STS and the inferior temporal convexity, similar to the sites in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Zhang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for details see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>During recording sessions, the monkeys fixated a central spot and were required to attend to a cued stimulus to detect a brief (50 ms) color change, while ignoring color changes of two other stimuli that served as distracters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Stimuli were gray-scale images of complex objects.</s><s>The cue appeared either 500-700 ms before or after the stimuli appeared on the screen.</s><s>The target and two distractors were placed at equidistant locations in the contralateral visual field.</s><s>The precise positions were adjusted to be optimal for V4, but they were normally at an eccentricity of about 5-7 deg.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pulvinar responses</head><p><s>A total of 339/641(53%) recording sites in the pulvinar were visually responsive (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P&lt; 0.05), compared to 310/366 (85%) in V4 and 210/422 (50%) in IT cortex, and all further analyses were based on these responsive sites.</s><s>On average, pulvinar RFs were intermediate in size between those in V4 and IT cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2a</ref>), consistent with anatomical studies showing that separated points in the V4 visual field map may have overlapping connections with a given location in the pulvinar <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gattass et al, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A total of 120 of 339 pulvinar sites (35%) showed significant stimulus selectivity when tested with the complex objects, compared to 129 sites (42%) in V4 and 68 sites (32 %) in IT cortex, according to an ANOVA calculated on responses to all stimuli, and relative stimulus tuning (object selectivity) for the selective cells was similar across all three areas (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, to a first approximation, the pulvinar appears to reflect the sensory properties of cells in the cortex, consistent with its role in relaying visual information from one cortical visual area to another.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of attention</head><p><s>We tested for the effects of attention on 'Attention In' versus 'Attention Out' trials.</s><s>On the Attention In trials, the stimulus in the RF of the recorded neurons was the target, which was attended by the monkeys.</s><s>On the Attention Out trials, the stimulus in the RF was an unattended distracter, and attention was directed to a target stimulus outside of the RF.</s><s>The monkeys performed 72.8% correct on detection of the target color change and rarely (2.6%) responded to a distractor color change.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows population averages of V4 and pulvinar responses in the Attention In and Attention Out conditions with the cue presented first.</s><s>Both areas showed larger responses to the attended stimulus compared to the unattended.</s><s>The latency of attentional effects was assessed in these "cue-first" sessions, because they were not affected by transient inhibitory responses to the cue sometimes found in the "stimulus-first" sessions.</s><s>Latencies calculated directly from the population histograms showed attentional effects at 135 ms and 115 ms after stimulus onset in the pulvinar and area V4, respectively.</s><s>However, the latency difference failed to reach significance (two-sided permutation test, P=0.22), possibly because so few cells contributed to early effects in the population responses.</s><s>We also assessed latencies using the full cumulative distribution of latencies calculated for each recording site separately, which takes into account the full distribution of latencies.</s><s>The effects of attention were significantly later in pulvinar than in V4 in the cumulative distributions (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P=0.0085; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The magnitude of the attentional effect was quantified by an attention contrast index (Methods) based on firing rates during the 250 ms window preceding the earliest target or distracter color-change.</s><s>With the cue presented first or second, the mean attentional index in the pulvinar was 0.04 (cue-first, n=105) or 0.03 (stimulus-first, n=132), respectively (Wilcoxon signed rank test, cue-first, P=1.61e-6; stimulus-first, P=0.0038), which was significantly smaller than the mean index in area V4, which was 0.16 (cue-first, n=152) or 0.13 (stimulus-first, n=136), respectively (Wilcoxon rank sum test, cue-first, P=6.11e-10; stimulus-first, P=2.47e-11).</s><s>Given that attentional effects in the pulvinar were smaller and occurred later than in V4 in the cumulative distribution of latencies, these pulvinar effects might reflect attentional effects in the cortical areas that project to it.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of attention on spike-LFP coherence within and across areas</head><p><s>To test for synchrony among the three structures, we measured the coherence between spikes and LFPs recorded simultaneously across the three areas.</s><s>Only those pulvinar and IT neurons with RFs that overlapped the RF of V4 neurons were included in this analysis.</s><s>We focused on the 256 ms time window immediately before the earliest target or distracter color change so that LFPs would not be contaminated by the transient of the evoked stimulus response.</s><s>Data from cue-first and stimulus-first sessions were combined in this analysis.</s><s>We compared trials in which the target was located within a shared RF (Attention In) to those in which a distracter was in the shared RF (Attention Out).</s><s>To account for spike-field coherence effects that might be influenced by differing firing rates across attentional conditions, we subtracted the coherence computed after shuffling trials (Methods).</s></p><p><s>Consistent with the results of previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fries et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mitchell et al., 2009)</ref>, spike-field coherence within V4 was enhanced by attention at gamma frequencies (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P=4.86e-46; n = 1489; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), and coherence below about 15 Hz (theta-alpha) was reduced by attention (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P=7.61e-11; n = 1489).</s><s>We also found for the first time that spike-field coherence within IT was enhanced in the gamma range (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P=7.58e-13; n =1349) with attention to the preferred location in the RF, despite the fact that the IT neurons had larger RFs and thus less spatial selectivity.</s><s>Thus, gamma synchrony appears to be enhanced by attention throughout the extrastriate areas of the ventral stream.</s><s>There was no significant change in gamma coherence within the pulvinar with attention (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P=0.31; n = 1278; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Gamma coherence between V4 spikes and IT LFPs was also enhanced by attention (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p=5.12e-36; n = 1720), as was the coherence between IT spikes and V4 LFPs (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p=7.50e-5; n = 917; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The increased gamma coherence between V4 and IT occurred only when attention was directed to a location that fell within the overlap between the V4 RF and IT RF, even though the unattended stimulus location was typically also located within the same large IT RF, similar to what was found between V1 and V4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bosman et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the spatial resolution of the attentional modulation of coherence between V4 and IT was finer than the IT RF.</s></p><p><s>Although there was no significant attentional modulation of gamma coherence within the pulvinar itself, gamma coherence between pulvinar LFPs and V4 spikes was enhanced significantly by attention (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p=1.35e-22; n=1461; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), as were pulvinar spikes and V4 LFPs (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p=1.01e-13; n=1625; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), and there was a corresponding decrease in coherence at low frequencies (&lt;=15Hz, theta-alpha) in both directions with attention (Wilcoxon signed rank test, V4 spike -Pulvinar LFP, p=6.40e-05; pulvinar spike -V4 LFP, p=1.83e-03).</s><s>Thus, the effects of attention on gamma synchrony between V4 and pulvinar were similar to what has been found between cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buffalo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grothe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Roberts et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Enhanced gamma coherence and firing rates with attention are thought to enhance inter-areal communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gregoriou et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bastos et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>There was very little attentional modulation of gamma coherence between the pulvinar and IT cortex, possibly because the recordings were targeted to the portions of the pulvinar with mainly V4 connections.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with these interactions in the frequency domain, we also found a correlation between firing rates in the pulvinar and the LFP power within V4 and IT.</s><s>On a trial-to-trial basis, V4 and IT gamma power in the LFP was positively and significantly correlated with pulvinar firing rates (V4, 40-100Hz, 0.0050, t-test, P=2.66e-4;
