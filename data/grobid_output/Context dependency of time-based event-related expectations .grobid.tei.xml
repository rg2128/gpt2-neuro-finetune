however, the longer we do not smell anything the more likely that we forgot to turn on the oven.</s></p><p><s>In the past, different types of expectations 1 such as spatial, identity-specific, temporal and time-based event-related expectations (for graphical illustration, see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) have been examined.</s><s>Spatial expectations-expectations about where events will happen-are traditionally manipulated using spatial probabilistic cues without providing information about the temporal onset or identity of targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Posner, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Posner et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zuanazzi &amp;

specifically, effects of TE were often reduced for unimodal auditory and even more for visual unisensory targets (compared with multisensory audio-visual targets).</s><s>This finding might imply that participants, instead of creating TEs which should facilitate perception of and preparation for all targets independent of modality may have rather created modality-specific TBEE in our TE study.</s><s>However, given that we manipulated only TEs and not TBEE, our results can also be explained by multisensory interplay (i.e., higher performance for multi-compared with unisensory stimuli;
