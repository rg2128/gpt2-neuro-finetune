<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Sensory perception emerges from the confluence of sensory inputs that encode the composition of external environment and top-down feedback that conveys information from higher brain centers.</s><s>In olfaction, sensory input activity is initially processed in the olfactory bulb (OB), serving as the first central relay before being transferred to the olfactory cortex.</s><s>In addition, the OB receives dense connectivity from feedback projections, so the OB has the capacity to implement a wide array of sensory neuronal computation.</s><s>However, little is known about the impact and the regulation of this cortical feedback.</s><s>Here, we describe a novel mechanism to gate glutamatergic feedback selectively from the anterior olfactory cortex (AOC) to the OB.</s><s>Combining in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recordings, optogenetics, and fiber-photometry-based calcium imaging applied to wild-type and conditional transgenic mice, we explore the functional consequences of circuit-specific GABA type-B receptor (GABA B R) manipulation.</s><s>We found that activation of presynaptic GABA B Rs specifically depresses synaptic transmission from the AOC to OB inhibitory interneurons, but spares direct excitation to principal neurons.</s><s>As a consequence, feedforward inhibition of spontaneous and odor-evoked activity of principal neurons is diminished.</s><s>We also show that tunable cortico-bulbar feedback is critical for generating beta, but not gamma, OB oscillations.</s><s>Together, these results show that GABA B Rs on cortico-bulbar afferents gate excitatory transmission in a target-specific manner and thus shape how the OB integrates sensory inputs and top-down information.</s></p></div>
