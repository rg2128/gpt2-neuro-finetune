<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Olfactory perception in the fly is initiated by the binding of an odorant to an ensemble of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the antennae, resulting in the activation of a unique and topographically fixed combination of glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>The discrimination of odours therefore requires the integration of information from multiple glomeruli in higher olfactory centres.</s><s>AL projection neurons (PNs) extend dendrites into a single glomerulus and project axons that bifurcate to innervate two distinct brain regions, the lateral horn and the MB <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>The invariant circuitry of the lateral horn is thought to mediate innate behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , whereas the MB translates olfactory sensory information into learned behavioural responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>PN axons that innervate the MB terminate in large boutons <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> that synapse on KCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> .</s><s>A given KC extends a small number of dendritic "claws", with each claw receiving information from only one PN bouton <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> .</s><s>A single bouton connects to multiple KC claws to form a discrete anatomic structure, the microglomerulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> .</s><s>Each KC projects an axon to one of the three different classes of MB lobes, α/β, α'/β', or γ, where it synapses upon a relatively small number of extrinsic output neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Electrophysiological and optical imaging studies show that odorants activate sparse subpopulations of KCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> distributed across the MB without spatial preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Individual KCs could be connected to preferential combinations of glomeruli that are co-ordinately activated by behaviourally relevant odours.</s><s>Alternatively, KCs may not receive structured input; rather the glomerular inputs may be random, a feature that maximizes the diversity of odour representations in the MB.</s><s>We have exploited the specialized structure of the PN-KC synapse to characterize the glomerular origin of the PNs that converge onto individual KCs.</s></p><p><s>Photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP) was expressed in all neurons of the fly and a single KC was photolabelled.</s><s>We observe that individual photolabelled KCs elaborate between 2 and 11 dendritic claws (average = 7, n = 200) restricted to the main olfactory calyx (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, h, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The axonal projections of a labelled KC can be traced into either the α/β, α'β', or γ lobes of the MB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Texas red dextran was then electroporated into the centre of a single KC claw, filling the PN bouton innervating that claw (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-f</ref>).</s><s>Retrograde transfer of the dye labels a single PN and its associated AL glomerulus (n = 665, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>, Supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), providing further evidence that an individual KC claw receives input from only a single glomerulus.</s></p><p><s>We verified that this tracing method identifies functional connections between PNs and KCs.</s><s>Functional imaging was performed on flies that express the calcium indicator GCaMP3 in most KCs to identify the claws activated by the stimulation of a single glomerulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Electroporation of dye into an activated microglomerulus labels a single PN that innervates the stimulated glomerulus (n=10, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c-f</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the electroporation of dye into a KC claw allows us to faithfully identify the PN to which it is functionally connected.</s><s>We used the strategy of photolabelling a single KC and sequential electroporation of dye into each of its claws to define glomerular inputs to an individual KC.</s><s>In initial experiments, PA-GFP was expressed in all neurons and 100 randomly chosen KCs were photolabelled in 100 different flies.</s><s>Among the 100 photolabelled KCs, 84 α/β KCs, 14 α'/β' KCs, but only 2 γ KCs were identified (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Each MB contains about 1000 α/β KCs, 370 α'β' KCs, and 670 γ KCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>γKCs are underrepresented in this initial data set.</s><s>This is likely to result from the spatial segregation of their cell bodies, which renders γ KCs less accessible to photolabelling.</s><s>Most α/βKCs, but not the α/β and α'β' KCs, express Fruitless (Fru) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> .</s><s>An additional 100 γ KCs were targeted for photoactivation in flies expressing PA-GFP under the control of the Fru promoter (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Texas red dextran was sequentially electroporated into different claws of a photolabelled KC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>It is technically difficult to fill all the claws of a KC and on average 3 glomerular inputs were identified per KC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>In fewer than 5% of the samples, the number of labelled PNs differed from the number of claws filled, reflecting either unsuccessful or imprecise electroporation.</s><s>Samples with more labelled PNs than expected were discarded.</s><s>The low frequency of unsuccessful claw fills indicates that claws extending from a given KC were filled with equal efficiency independent of size.</s><s>Thus the size of a claw was not a selection criterion in these experiments.</s></p><p><s>A total of 683 inputs that synapse on 200 KCs were identified (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>We found that 654 of these inputs connect to PNs innervating 49 of the 51 AL glomeruli.</s><s>PNs innervating the DA3 and VL1 are absent from our data set but we observe boutons from these PNs in the MB calyx (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>29 of the claws receive input from brain regions other than the AL.</s><s>Interestingly, 11 of these claws are innervated by PNs that derive from pseudoglomeruli in the proximal antennal protocerebrum, a thermosensing centre in the fly brain that receives input from distinct heat-and cold-sensing neurons in the antennae <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>The remaining 18 PNs innervated different uncharacterized regions of the brain.</s></p><p><s>We observe that the distribution of the glomerular inputs to KCs is not uniform (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Inputs from the DA1 and DC3 glomeruli are most frequent, with each accounting for 5.1% of the total connections.</s><s>The non-uniform distribution reflects the fact that the size and number of calycal boutons formed by PNs varies across glomeruli (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>For instance, the PNs associated with the DA1 and DC3 glomeruli form more numerous boutons in comparison with the PNs of less frequently represented glomeruli (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We also observe that there is a small but significant difference between the inputs to the α/β and γ KCs (p &lt; 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>All subsequent statistical analyses were therefore performed separately on both the α/β and γ data sets, but failed to reveal any significant difference between the two data sets.</s><s>Therefore, only the results obtained from the full data set are shown.</s></p><p><s>Statistical analyses of the 665 connections allow us to search for structure among the connections between glomeruli and KCs.</s><s>First, we determined whether the KCs receiving input from a given glomerulus have a higher probability of receiving additional input from that same glomerulus.</s><s>Of the 200 KCs in the data set, only 11 receive two inputs from the same glomerulus, and none receive three or more such inputs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>We determined whether the frequency of convergent input from a single glomerulus is significantly above or below chance expectations by randomly shuffling the connections in the data set between the different KCs, while maintaining the number of connections each of them receives.</s><s>This shuffling maintains the frequency of glomerular connections observed in the experimental data, but eliminates any potential, non-random patterns of inputs onto individual KCs.</s><s>This shuffling is used in all subsequent statistical analyses.</s><s>The frequency of multiple connections from the same glomerulus in the observed and shuffled data sets is not significantly different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, we observe no KCs that receive preferential inputs from a single glomerulus.</s><s>Rather, individual KCs integrate information from multiple different glomeruli.</s></p><p><s>We next determined whether KCs are connected to any preferential pair, trio, or quartet of glomeruli.</s><s>Of the 1378 (53*52/2) different pairs of glomeruli that could converge onto an individual KC, 508 distinct pairs appear in the data set (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>310 of these pairs connect to only one of the 200 KCs analysed, whereas certain pairs of glomeruli connect to multiple KCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>The DA1-DC3 pair, for example, converges onto nine different KCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>There are combinations of glomerular trios that connect with two different KCs, and one case in which two KCs receive inputs from the same quartet of glomeruli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>However, the observed frequency with which the different pairs, trios and quartets converge onto different KCs is consistent with expectations from the shuffled data set (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>, data not shown).</s><s>Thus, the identity of a glomerulus connected to a KC provides no predictive information as to the identity of the remaining glomerular inputs onto that neuron.</s></p><p><s>Glomeruli can be grouped based on biological properties shared by their associated OSNs (sensilla type, odour specificity) and PNs (developmental origin and topography of their axonal projections).</s><s>KCs might receive preferential input from one or another of these glomerular categories.</s><s>For example, the OSNs innervating the AL are derived from three sensillar types (basiconic, coeloconic, and trichoid sensilla) that project to three classes of glomeruli tuned to different odour categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>If individual KCs were tuned to a particular class of odours, they might preferentially integrate inputs from one type of sensillum.</s><s>Statistical analyses, however, reveal that KCs that receive an input from one sensillar type are no more or less likely to receive additional inputs from this or any other type of sensillum than is predicted by chance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e-h</ref>).</s><s>Sensillar type, however, provides only a coarse correlate of odour tuning.</s><s>Therefore, we also grouped glomeruli based on the similarity of their odour response profiles and again observed no structure in the inputs to a KC that correlated with odour tuning (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also classified glomeruli on the basis of the properties of their PNs.</s><s>PN axons from different glomeruli project to broad but stereotyped domains in the lateral horn and calyx of the MB.</s><s>Input to an individual KC could be shaped by the topography of PN projections.</s><s>Analysis of the distribution of inputs to a given KC, however, fails to reveal any preferential PN connectivity that reflects the organization of their projection 7 in either the MB calyx (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) or lateral horn (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>KCs do not preferentially integrate information from glomeruli innervated by PNs sharing a developmental origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>In addition, KCs do not select their input based on topographical constraints as suggested by a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> (Fig 4d, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Finally, three glomeruli are innervated by Fru-expressing OSNs and PNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>We do not observe preferential pairing of inputs from Fru + PNs onto individual KCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, although most γ KCs express Fru, there is no preferential input from Fru + glomeruli to γ KCs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we performed an unbiased search for structure by examining correlations within the connectivity matrix between the 53 glomeruli (51 AL glomeruli and 2 pseudoglomeruli) and the 200 KCs.</s><s>Correlations were extracted by performing a principal component analysis of this matrix (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>).</s><s>This analysis failed to reveal structure in the input to KCs other than that inherent in the non-uniform distribution of glomerular inputs.</s><s>These data are consistent with a model in which each KC receives input from a combination of glomeruli randomly chosen from the non-uniform distribution of glomerular projections to the MB.</s><s>Classification of either glomeruli or KCs on the basis of several shared developmental, anatomic, and functional features fails to reveal structured input onto individual KCs.</s><s>Members of a given PN class do not preferentially converge onto an individual KC nor do members of a KC class receive specific and distinguishing PN inputs.</s><s>A given KC can integrate information from glomeruli activated by food odours, pheromones, CO 2 and even temperature.</s><s>Recent data suggests that the extrinsic output neurons of the MB that are responsible for the different forms of learned behaviour are anatomically segregated and synapse with KC axons within a specific MB lobe <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, similar glomerular inputs are observed for the KCs that innervate the different lobes of the MB.</s><s>This random input to individual KCs provides a mechanism to contextualize a rich diversity of novel KC responses.</s></p><p><s>It is important to note that the tracing procedure we have developed only allows us to characterize the inputs to a single KC per fly.</s><s>It is therefore possible that the inputs to every KC are determined but this developmental program results in a distribution of glomerular inputs that appears random.</s><s>However, it is difficult to conceive of a development mechanism that could dictate the identity of inputs to each of the seven claws of the 2000 KCs.</s><s>Moreover, the logic of employing complex and unlikely identity codes to achieve an uncorrelated distribution of inputs is elusive.</s><s>Indeed, a previous study examined the electrophysiological response of KCs to different odours in a line of flies that labels only 23 α/β neurons but failed to identify replicate KCs with shared odour response profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>These observations support the conclusion that the complement of glomerular inputs to KCs differs in different individuals.</s><s>In addition, we cannot, from the analysis of the glomerular inputs to 200 KCs, exclude the existence of small subsets of KCs that received determined inputs from the AL.</s><s>Nonetheless, our data are most consistent with a model in which the majority of individual KCs receive input from a random collection of glomeruli, a finding with important implications for odour processing in the MB.</s></p><p><s>If the connections from AL to MB are indeed random, a given odour will activate a different ensemble of KCs in different flies.</s><s>However, in an individual fly, a given odour will consistently activate the same ensemble.</s><s>This representation must acquire valence through experience or unsupervised activity dependent plasticity to dictate an appropriate behavioural output.</s><s>Uncorrelated glomerular input to KCs affords the fly with the ability to impart meaning to a diversity of novel and unpredictable sensory stimuli that it may encounter throughout its life.</s><s>Plasticity at highly convergent synapses between KC axons and MB extrinsic neurons could mediate experience-dependent behavioural output, an elemental feature of MB function.</s><s>Thus, the fly has evolved an olfactory circuit with a connectivity that optimizes its ability to contextualize and respond appropriately to a rich array of olfactory experiences.</s></p></div>
