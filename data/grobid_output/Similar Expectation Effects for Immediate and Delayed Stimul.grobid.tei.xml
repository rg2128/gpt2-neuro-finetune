<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Repetition related phenomena have been widely studied using both electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques.</s><s>Typically these studies report suppression of the neural signal for repeated when compared to alternating stimuli (repetition suppression, RS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Henson and Rugg, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Grill-Spector et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>RS has been explained in many ways (i.e., synaptic depression, network dynamics, and facilitation of the neural response) and has become one of the most intensively studied phenomena in cognitive neurosciences.</s><s>Further, it is broadly applied as a tool to investigate the selective properties of neuronal populations in neuroimaging experiments (fMRI adaptation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Malach, 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recently, the neural mechanisms of RS have been connected to predictive coding theories of sensory perception (PC, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Friston, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Auksztulewicz and Friston, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>According to models of PC, the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and then computes the difference between these predictions and the actual sensory input.</s><s>Therefore, surprising/incorrectly predicted events cause higher neural activity than expected/correctly predicted events <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Friston, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Friston, , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Friston and Kiebel, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In other words, the occurrence of an expected event can also lead to reduced neuronal activity when compared to incorrect predictions, i.e., to surprising events.</s><s>This phenomenon was recently labeled expectation suppression (ES, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Todorovic and de Lange, 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In an influential study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Summerfield et al. (2008)</ref> presented participants with pairs of faces that could either repeat or alternate.</s><s>These faces were grouped into blocks with either high (75%, RB) or low (25%, AB) repetition probabilities (P(rep)].</s><s>The results revealed larger RS in the fusiform face area (FFA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kanwisher et al., 1997)</ref> in blocks with more repetitions (RB), and hence more expected when compared to blocks with fewer repetitions, and thus surprising repetitions (AB).</s><s>Therefore, the authors suggested that higher-order contextual expectations modulated repetition-related processes.</s><s>Other studies confirmed the existence of such P(rep) modulations of RS for faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kovács et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kovács et al., , 2013;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Larsson and Smith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grotheer et al., 2014)</ref> and Roman letters <ref type="bibr">(Grotheer and Kovács, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>While no such modulations were found for chairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kovács et al., 2013)</ref> or unfamiliar characters <ref type="bibr">(Grotheer and Kovács, 2014)</ref>, but for a different conclusion see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mayrhauser et al. (2014)</ref>.</s><s>All of these studies used a factorial design in which repetition and repetition probability varied orthogonally.</s><s>However, they did not allow the independent testing of expectation and repetition effects due to the use of high and low repetition blocks to manipulate expectations.</s></p><p><s>Other studies have induced explicit perceptual expectations on a trial-by-trial basis by associating a given stimulus with a preceding schematic cue or image <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Egner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Meyer and Olson, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Current MEG and neuroimaging studies have combined such paradigms with stimulus repetitions, in the sense that the first stimulus of a pair signals the likelihood of repetitions or alternations, and found both ES and RS to be present in the target-related signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Todorovic and de Lange, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grotheer and Kovács, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Amado and Kovács, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, both the MEG and the neuroimaging studies have found that the effects of expectation and repetition are independent and additive processes in the human brain.</s><s>Moreover, a recent EEG study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Feuerriegel et al., 2018</ref>) also investigated whether repetition effects are influenced by perceptual expectations and found distinct spatiotemporal patterns of repetition and expectation effects, supporting the idea of separable mechanisms underlying these phenomena.</s></p><p><s>Earlier studies have explored the influence of the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) length on RS and showed similarities between short and long-lagged repetition effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Henson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sayres and Grill-Spector, 2006)</ref>, but it has also been suggested that different neuronal mechanisms explain RS for long and short ISIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Epstein et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kouider et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Weiner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Larsson and Smith, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, both electrophysiological <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feuerriegel et al., 2015)</ref> and behavioral <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Matthews, 2015)</ref> studies of RS and repetition priming, describing behavioral response improvements for repeatedly presented stimuli, have reported distinct effects of stimulus duration and ISI variability.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, it is also known that ISI length affects attentional cueing <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hansen and Hillyard, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busse et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, attentional cueing experiments rely on the flexible allocation of attention to specific aspects of the sensory stimulation, such as certain features of the stimuli, as well as their temporal or spatial properties.</s><s>In general, attention can be driven both by top-down (i.e., cognitive expectations, called "endogenous" attention) or bottom-up (i.e., sensory events, called "exogenous" attention) processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hopfinger and West, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The nature of the cue determines the type of attentional process (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Posner and Cohen, 1984)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, the ISI length seems to interfere with exogenous and endogenous attention in a different manner.</s><s>At short durations (at around 2 s), endogenous attention enhances perceptual sensitivity (through an improvement in the accuracy of the responses).</s><s>However, at longer durations (typically larger than 4 s) endogenous attention can actually impair stimulus sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ling and Carrasco, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>In the case of exogenous attentional processes, the responses are faster and more accurate when valid cues are presented with short intervals between the cue and the target.</s><s>If, however, the ISI length is large the participants' reactions for valid cues will be slower (i.e., larger than 300 ms; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Posner and Cohen, 1984)</ref> and less accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Handy et al., 1999)</ref> than for invalid cues.</s><s>Also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busse et al. (2006)</ref> found facilitation of the behavioral response (in terms of shorter RTs) with short cue-target ISIs, only when both location and feature cues were valid.</s><s>Longer ISIs induced the opposite effect, as the RTs were longer when the targets appeared at the cued location.</s></p><p><s>In terms of the PC theory expectations are probability-based top-down information that are tested against sensory input.</s><s>Endogenous attention can be connected to the term perceptual expectation as both can rely on cues on a trial-by-trial basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Meyer and Olson, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In spite of the demonstrated effects of ISI on RS and on attentional cueing, previous studies which have investigated ES have invariably used short (in the range of few hundred milliseconds) delay-intervals between the predictive cue and the target <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Egner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grotheer and Kovács, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Amado and Kovács, 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since we have no information on the temporal dynamics of cue-based expectation effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Matthews and Gheorghiu, 2016)</ref>, the current study aimed to investigate whether additive effects of RS and ES are consistent across changes of the presentation delay.</s><s>To this end, we used the methods, task, and paradigm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grotheer and Kovács (2015)</ref> with different ISI lengths.</s><s>To anticipate our results, we observed significant RS and ES in the FFA, but we did not find any interaction between ES and RS for either ISI conditions, suggesting that the length of ISI does not influence the neural mechanisms of ES and RS.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Twenty-six healthy Caucasian volunteers participated in the experiment.</s><s>The number of participants was chosen based on our prior published works.</s><s>In our previous papers testing RS <ref type="bibr">(Grotheer et al., 2014: n = 26;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grotheer and Kovács, 2014: n = 17;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grotheer and Kovács, 2015: n = 25;</ref><ref type="bibr">Amado et al., 2016: n = 22;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hermann et al., 2016</ref>: n = 29) we invariably tested similar number of participants and observed always strong and reliable RS as well as probability-based modulations of RS.</s><s>Therefore, we did not use any specific way to estimate the sample sizes here.</s><s>No participant reported any neurological or psychiatric illnesses and all subjects had normal or corrected to normal visual acuity and gave written informed consent in accordance with the protocols approved by the Ethical Committee of the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena by following the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>Overall, three participants were excluded from the final analysis.</s><s>One was excluded due to excessive headmovements (i.e., translation/rotation of &gt; 5 mm/degrees) during the recording, while another participant failed to perform the experimental task properly (the performance was below 50% in one experimental run) and one participant interrupted the recording session.</s><s>Therefore, the current report is based on the data of 23 participants (17 females; 20 right-handed, mean age (±SD): 21.6 (0.7) years).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulation and Procedure</head><p><s>Stimuli were 300 gray-scale, digital photos of full-frontal Caucasian faces (2.75 • visual angle), identical to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grotheer and Kovács (2015)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, stimuli were fit behind a circular mask, placed in the center of the screen on a uniform black background.</s><s>Stimulus pairs were presented, with 250 ms presentation time for each stimulus.</s><s>We only used Caucasian faces as it is known that the own-race bias results in differences regarding the perceptual expertise with own when compared to other-race faces (for review see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Meissner and Brigham, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Two ISI conditions were used.</s><s>In the Immediate condition, the ISI was 500 ms, and hence identical to that of previous publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grotheer and Kovács, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Amado and Kovács, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In the Delayed condition, the ISI was varied randomly between 1.75 and 3.75 s (this temporal jitter was introduced to help the separation of the BOLD response, related to S1 and S2 as these two are not presented within one TR anymore).</s><s>The two ISI trial types (Immediate and Delayed) were presented in two separate runs in an order randomized across participants.</s><s>The inter-trial intervals were randomized between 1 and 3 s or between 3.75 and 5.75 s for the Immediate and Delayed conditions, respectively (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>This relatively short timerange for the Delayed ISI condition was chosen because the further elongation of the ISI (to the order of minutes) would have led to an experiment-duration up to 2 h.</s><s>Two runs were recorded from each participant (one for each ISI condition) and no stimulus occurred in more than one trial during a given run (i.e., the same stimulus could occur in two different runs).</s><s>The runs contained 180 trials and lasted for about 11 and 25 min for the Immediate and Delayed conditions, respectively.</s><s>Stimuli were back-projected via an LCD video projector (NEC GT 1150, NEC Deutschland GmbH, Ismaning, Germany, with modified lens for short focal point) onto a translucent circular screen, placed inside the scanner bore [stimulus presentation was controlled by Matlab R2013a (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, United States), using Psychtoolbox (Version 3.0.9)].</s></p><p><s>Trial structure and design were identical to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grotheer and Kovács (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Amado and Kovács (2016)</ref>.</s><s>We used a paired stimulus presentation where the predictive cue, the first stimulus (S1), could either be different <ref type="bibr">[Alternation Trial (Alt)</ref>] or identical <ref type="bibr">[Repetition Trial (Rep)</ref>] to the second, target stimulus (S2).</s><s>To reduce local feature adaptation the size of either S1 or S2 (chosen randomly) was reduced by 18%.</s><s>Both stimuli of a pair were either female or male and participants were presented with 50% female/male trials randomly.</s><s>The gender of S1 cued stimulus repetition or alternation to the participants probabilistically, meaning high (75%) or low (25%) probabilities of repetition/alternation of the target stimulus (S2).</s><s>For example, for half of the subjects, female faces signaled high repetition probability (75%), while male faces signaled high alternation probability (75%).</s><s>This way, participants could form expectations regarding the likelihood of repetitions and alternations.</s><s>Correctly predicted trials correspond to a congruence between the given cue (S1) and the repetition/alternation occurrence during S2 (75% of the trials), whereas the incorrectly predicted, or surprising trials correspond to an incongruency between the given cue (S1) and the repetition/alternation occurrence during S2 (25% of the trials).</s><s>The relationship between face gender and repetition probability was counterbalanced across participants (11 participants in one version and 12 in the other one), in a way that for the other half of the subjects (N = 11) the gender cueing high repetition probability was male and the relative repetition probabilities were reversed accordingly.</s><s>Participants were informed about the relative repetition/alternation probabilities as well as about their contingencies on the face gender of S1 prior to the scanning sessions.</s><s>In addition, participants performed a 5-min long training session (using stimuli that were different from those used in the main experiment) immediately prior to the fMRI recordings.</s></p><p><s>Briefly, a trial started with a yellow fixation cross, which was presented for 1 or 3 s in the Immediate ISI condition and 3.75 or 5.75 s in the Delayed ISI condition.</s><s>Participants were asked to fixate it.</s><s>The cross was followed by the predictive cue, S1, which was shown for 250 ms.</s><s>During the ISI a small white circle appeared on the screen.</s><s>The ISI conditions correspond to Immediate and Delayed lengths of fix 500 ms and varying 1.75/3.75</s><s>s, respectively.</s><s>Finally, the target, S2, was presented for 250 ms.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, following the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Larsson and Smith (2012)</ref>, 20 (11.1% of the trials) additional blank trials were included in each run to enable the estimation of the average response time course to the target stimulus (S2) alone.</s><s>In these trials, S1 was normally displayed and instead of S2, a blank screen was presented.</s><s>This way, an estimate of the average response time course to S2 alone was obtained by performing a subtraction between the blank trials and the experimental conditions which included S2 and S1 as well.</s><s>In order not to bias the predictions of participants, these trials had an equal amount of female and male faces for S1.</s><s>Importantly, the overall probabilities for the correctly predicted and surprising conditions were 66.7 and 22.2%, respectively.</s><s>As the introduction of the blank trials made the separation of subsequent trials perceptually more difficult, the color of the fixation cross was changed to yellow before the presentation of S1, to clearly mark the beginning of trials.</s></p><p><s>In total, we had five different experimental conditions, presented randomly within a run: expected repetition (E_Rep), expected alternation (E_Alt), surprising repetition (S_Rep), surprising alternation (S_Alt), and blank (Blank) trials.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the experimental design.</s></p><p><s>To control participants' attention and to confirm that they are able to judge the stimulus gender effectively, 18% of the trials were target trials in which subjects had to report whether the S1 had been a female or male face by pressing a button <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Todorovic and de Lange, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, for these target trials, a choice-screen was presented for 2 s centrally showing either the text "female?</s><s>male" or "male?</s><s>female," randomly.</s><s>The

(2017)</ref> employed the influential Summerfield paradigm (2008) with an additional alternating block type where alternations were predictable.</s><s>Participants could predict the S2 face based on S1, as S2 was specifically paired with S1.</s><s>The participants were not aware of the contingencies but learned those in a preceding training session on the day before the scanning session.</s><s>The authors found that predictable alternation trials elicited reduced FFA responses, as compared to unpredictable faces.</s><s>Interestingly, repetition trials showed similar neuronal activation when presented in alternation blocks to when presented in the predictable alternation blocks.</s><s>In other words, even though these repetition trials are surprising FFA responses were more suppressed than for predictable.</s><s>In fact, repetition is always expected as it is the default expectation and, therefore, even with the alternating trials being predictable and expected, default expectations of repetition maintain and are stronger than the experimentally induced perceptually expectations.</s><s>Still, it is not yet known how the predictable alternation affects cue-based, explicit expectations.</s><s>Thus, future training studies will be necessary.</s></p><p><s>The gender-identification task used in the current study requires attention to S1 and not to S2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Todorovic and de Lange, 2012)</ref>, which can lead to different attentional states between S1 and S2.</s><s>Prior studies using this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grotheer and Kovács, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Amado et al., 2016)</ref> revealed that subjects utilized different repetition probabilities to perform the task.</s><s>In other words, even if they did not know or remember the gender of the first face, they could expect the faces to be repeated or alternating, congruent on the gender of S1.</s><s>If so, then participants should show perfect performance and faster reaction times for expected trials.</s><s>Interestingly, the results of the current study do not show any behavioral facilitation response for expected trials, a result similar to those of Todorovic and de Lange (2012).</s><s>One possible explanation is that the gender-identification of S1 is less dependent on the effects of expectation and surprise than that of S2.</s><s>We decided the behavioral task relied on the discrimination of the S1 gender, to make sure participants directed their attention to the S1 in a way that expectations were induced and to ensure those expectations were not incorrect due to wrong discrimination of the S1 gender.</s><s>It is possible that the chosen behavioral task might have directed attention toward S1 and way from S2, still, we found RS and ES effects in the FFA.</s><s>A very recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Olkkonen et al., 2017)</ref>, on the other hand, found a strong behavioral modulation of a priming effect (shorter RT for repeated as compared to alternating trials) depending on the likelihood of repetitions (larger modulation for expected as compared to unexpected trials).</s><s>Surprisingly and contrary to many prior studies, the fMRIa was not modulated by expectation in this study, suggesting the relative independence of behavioral and neuroimaging correlates of expectation and urging further experiments, testing the issue.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible ISI Variability Effects</head><p><s>In addition, we also know that the frequency or pace of events is a crucial parameter for the creation of expectations.</s><s>A central timing system also referred to as "pacemaker, " describes that the pace/frequency of the event occurrences enables the creation of temporal perception units <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Zakay and Block, 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it has been proposed that these local temporal perception units feed information to central systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Matthews, 2015)</ref> and probably have an important role in prediction generation as well.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Summerfield et al. (2011)</ref> investigated in an electrophysiological study how the consistency of stimulus repetition influences the effects of expectation and RS using stable (30-40 trial long) and volatile (10 trial long) blocks of stimulus presentations.</s><s>Note that expectation was manipulated using different repetition probabilities in these blocks.</s><s>Their results showed that RS was modulated by expectations at central electrodes for the stable, long blocks, while no modulation was present for the volatile, shorter blocks.</s><s>As stability over time (sometimes labeled as "time-variability, " see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Friston, 2010)</ref> can play a role in forming expectations, it will be important to test possible effects of ISI variability and the ISI length, independently.</s><s>This relates to the major limitation of the current experiment, i.e., the fact that the two ISIs had different variability characteristics, as we, due to methodological constraints, only had one long ISI but variable and one short and at the same time constant ISI condition.</s><s>Furthermore, the possibility that activation differences found between the Immediate and the Delayed ISIs are dependent on the different synchrony levels cannot be excluded as the additionally longer ITIs we used for the Delayed condition might also contribute to different overall temporal patterns.</s><s>Therefore, further experiments are necessary to disentangle these two distinct effects (variability and length).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole-Brain Analysis</head><p><s>The results obtained by the whole-brain analysis are in line with the previous studies that propose different neuronal mechanisms for short and long lagged cue-target stimulation periods.</s><s>The results show several brain activation differences between the Immediate and the Delayed ISIs.</s><s>Yet no significant differences between these two conditions were found in the FFA.</s><s>Moreover, the whole-brain did not elicit main effects of trial or expectation conditions which were previously found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grotheer and Kovács (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Amado et al. (2016)</ref>.</s><s>The lack of these effects in the present study might be due to the lower number of trials in comparison with the former studies.</s><s>Furthermore, the possibility that activation differences found between the Immediate and the Delayed ISIs are dependent on the different variability levels (constant and variable) cannot be excluded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>In conclusion, this study shows that RS and expectation effects in the FFA are independent and additive processes for both Immediate and Delayed ISIs.</s><s>As no significant difference was found between the two ISI lengths in the FFA, we can conclude the effects of repetition and expectation are maintained for several seconds in the FFA.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Overview of the stimulation parameters and arrangements.</s><s>At the beginning of each trial, a yellow fixation cross was presented for 1 or 3 s in the Immediate ISI condition and for 3.75 or 5.75 s in the Delayed ISI condition.</s><s>The cross was followed by the predictive cue, S1, which was shown for 250 ms.</s><s>During the ISI a small white circle appeared on the screen.</s><s>The ISI conditions correspond to Immediate and Delayed lengths of fix 500 ms and varying 1.75/3.75</s><s>s, respectively.</s><s>Finally, the target, S2, was presented for 250 ms.</s><s>Note that Immediate and Delayed trials were given in separate runs.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,128.13,69.02,336.96,216.14" type="bitmap" /></figure>
