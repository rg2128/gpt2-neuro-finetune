<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>ampullary organs also expressed several Ca V auxiliary subunits and exhibited similar I CaV current density and activation threshold compared with skate electrosensory cells (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>Thus, our results suggest that Ca V 1.3 mediates the major depolarizing current in both skate and shark electrosensory cells.</s></p><p><s>In skate electrosensory cells, Ca 2+ influx activated outward K + currents at relatively negative potentials to occlude inward Ca 2+ currents (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a-c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>In shark cells, however, we observed large K + currents that were activated at more positive voltages and did not affect inward current amplitude, suggesting reduced functional interaction between Ca 2+ and K + currents (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a-c</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, K + currents were not affected by a I CaV blocker or BK antagonist (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2d</ref>).</s><s>Instead, the voltage-gated K V channel inhibitor, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), blocked outward currents from shark electrosensory cells (I KV , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1b</ref>).</s><s>I KV was K + selective and exhibited a relatively high voltage activation threshold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we observed fast activation and deactivation kinetics, whereas voltage-dependent inactivation (similar to desensitization) in response to prolonged voltage pulses was weak and slow, resulting in a K + conductance of undiminished current amplitude even after repeated activation-deactivation cycles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1d</ref>, e and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2g</ref>).</s><s>Among voltage-gated K + channels, transcripts encoding the pore-forming subunit of K V 1.3 predominated in shark ampullary organs (together with several K V auxiliary subunits) and co-localized with Ca V 1.3 in electrosensory cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1f</ref>, g, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2h</ref>).</s><s>Outside of ampullary organs, only a truncated form of K V 1.3 lacking an essential N-terminal tetramerization domain was observed in the brain (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2i</ref>).</s><s>K V 1.3 expression was not detected in skate ampullary organs and only shark electrosensory cells expressed 4-AP sensitive voltage-gated K + currents (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a-b</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, both shark and skate electrosensory cells expressed BK transcripts which, when heterologously expressed, produced channels with similar properties; however, functional BK currents were observed only in the latter (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>Thus, BK channels do not contribute appreciably to the major K + conductance in shark electrosensory cells, at least not under developmental or physiological conditions examined here.</s><s>In summary, shark electrosensory cells express a specific I KV with voltage-dependent properties that support repetitive stimulation.</s><s>Shark K V 1.3 is 80% identical to the human orthologue, but its voltage threshold for activation was shifted to more depolarized values compared with human K V 1.3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4a</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, shark K V 1.3 activated at slightly slower rates and deactivated with rapid kinetics, requiring substantially less negative voltage to return to resting state compared with the human channel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Shark K V 1.3 inactivation was slow and only weakly voltage-dependent compared to human K V 1.3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4d</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, shark K V 1.3 produced a conductance that could be repetitively stimulated with undiminished amplitude, whereas human K V 1.3, quickly inactivated with repetitive voltage pulses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2e</ref>).</s><s>These biophysical properties resemble those of native shark I KV , which also exhibited a comparable pharmacological profile (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>One notable difference is that deactivation kinetics of native I KV were faster than those of the cloned channel, particularly at positive voltages.</s><s>Thus, while K V 1.3 forms the predominant K + conductance in shark electrosensory cells, auxiliary subunits, signaling cascades, or structural proteins may provide additional regulatory mechanisms to further enhance rapid deactivation.</s></p><p><s>The voltage-dependent properties of shark K V 1.3 likely derive from altered voltage sensor domain movements, which we verified by comparing gating currents from modified nonconductive shark and human K V 1.3.</s><s>For these experiments, we analyzed a human isoform exhibiting increased surface expression and thus enhanced gating current amplitude (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4g</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Similar to ion (permeating) currents, upward/activating voltage sensor movements (represented as ON gating charge, Q ON ) for shark K V 1.3 exhibited a higher voltage activation threshold and slower kinetics compared with human K V 1.3 (Extended Data 5a-c).</s><s>Moreover, shark K V 1.3 gating current deactivation (Q OFF; return of voltage sensors to resting state following depolarizing pulses) required less negative voltage and was accelerated (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5d-h</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, ion tail current deactivation, representing channel pore closure, was faster in shark K V 1.3 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5i</ref>).</s><s>Why does shark K V 1.3 favor the resting state?</s><s>When we recorded Q OFF following a series of depolarizing voltage pulses of varying lengths, human K V 1.3 deactivation kinetics markedly slowed following pulses longer than 1 ms, while shark channel deactivation rates remained relatively rapid and constant with increasing pulse lengths (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6a-d</ref>).</s><s>This slowing in deactivation is characteristic of voltage sensor domain 'relaxation', which has been proposed to slow K V channel closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>We therefore hypothesize that reduced voltage sensor relaxation in shark K V 1.3 results in decreased open state stability; as such, much less negative voltage is required to return channels to a resting state and mediate fast channel closure (depicted in our model, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We analyzed shark-human K V 1.3 chimeras to see if specific domains specify relevant biophysical attributes.</s><s>Replacement of the S1-S6 region of human K V 1.3 with that of shark recapitulated the high voltage activation threshold, rapid deactivation kinetics, and weak inactivation of wild type shark K V 1.3 channels, and the converse chimera also altered channel properties (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>We next substituted just the voltage sensor domain region (S1-S4) and found that activation threshold and deactivation kinetics were greatly affected, while inactivation remained similar (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, only inactivation was affected by replacing S5-S6 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7c-e</ref>), consistent with a role for the outer pore in C-type inactivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Thus, specific structural adaptations in the K V 1.3 transmembrane core specify physiologically relevant biophysical properties.</s></p><p><s>Membrane voltage (V m ) oscillations within ampullae control neurotransmitter release from electrosensory cells onto afferent nerves, thereby sculpting signals to the central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>In skate electrosensory cells, functional coupling of Ca V 1.3 and BK mediates V m oscillations that are tuned to low frequencies, such as those detected by behaving animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with our previous results, skate electrosensory cells had a resting V m of -54 mV, near the peak of the I CaV window current where cells exhibited spontaneous voltage oscillations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Injecting current to bring skate cell V m to various potentials modulated oscillatory behavior, greatly changing both frequency and amplitude across physiological membrane potentials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, shark electrosensory cells had an average resting V m of -66 mV, on the cusp of the I CaV window current where cells were relatively quiet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Injecting current to bring V m within the range of I CaV threshold and window current elicited robust repetitive V m spiking that lasted the duration of recordings.</s><s>Spiking only slightly decreased in amplitude and frequency at more positive voltages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), since spike amplitude is likely determined by the voltage threshold of I KV .</s><s>Indeed, the I CaV inhibitor nifedipine blocked evoked depolarization and 4-AP prevented or greatly slowed repolarization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3c</ref>).</s><s>Thus, in both shark and skate, activity is limited to membrane voltages in which I CaV window current is observed, but dynamics are drastically different, behaving more as an all-or-none ON/OFF switch in sharks compared to a more tunable system in skates.</s></p><p><s>To further assess how I CaV and I KV kinetics and voltage dependence contribute to V m spiking dynamics, we recorded currents in response to simulated V m spikes in voltageclamp.</s><s>Repetitive simulated spikes induced inward and subsequent outward currents that rapidly activated and deactivated but did not inactivate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3d</ref>).</s><s>Inward I CaV was small at a resting potential of -65 mV and increased with positive voltage until a high voltage threshold, which triggered an outward current that rapidly deactivated when voltage was returned to rest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3d</ref>).</s><s>4-AP blocked this outward current, implicating I KV , while also revealing a resurgent I CaV upon hyperpolarization that could contribute to initiating the following voltage spike (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the low voltage threshold and inactivation properties of I CaV , coupled with the high voltage threshold, rapid deactivation, and weak inactivation of I KV are suited to cooperatively mediate V m spiking in shark electrosensory cells.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, transcripts for Ca 2+ binding proteins and pumps were enriched in shark ampullary organs, which may help facilitate repetitive Ca 2+ influx (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>).</s><s>Together, these cellular properties could support robust repetitive activity in shark electrosensory cells to amplify responses to incoming electrical signals.</s><s>In contrast, skate cells exhibit low-level tonic activity at rest that could be retimed or modulated in response to particular incoming electrical frequencies to alter neurotransmitter release.</s></p><p><s>To determine how synaptic vesicle release is affected by differences in V m activity, we monitored membrane capacitance (C m ) to measure vesicle fusion in response to electrical stimuli.</s><s>Depolarization of shark or skate electrosensory cells elicited inward currents and capacitance changes that were blocked by Cd 2+ , indicating that I CaV is required for vesicular release (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4a</ref>).</s><s>Increasing stimulus duration increased C m changes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>), but with distinct dynamics in shark versus skate electrosensory cells: brief voltage stimuli induced larger changes in shark cell C m that saturated in response to longer stimuli, while skate cells exhibited C m changes that increased linearly with stimulus duration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Differences in synaptic vesicle number or distribution could account for these distinct vesicle release dynamics.</s><s>Skate electrosensory cells contain large synaptic ribbons that tether numerous vesicles for release onto postsynaptic afferents <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, shark and skate ampullae expressed transcripts associated with ribbon synapses, and ultrastructural analysis of electrosensory cells revealed that both contain remarkably long synaptic ribbons compared to those from mammalian hair cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, shark and skate ribbons were similarly shaped and tethered an equivalent number of vesicles of comparable diameter.</s><s>However, shark electrosensory cells had a larger "readily releasable" vesicle pool (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8d</ref>), which facilitates rapid and efficient exocytosis in other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and might account for our observation that short voltage stimuli induce larger changes in C m in electrosensory cells from shark.</s><s>Skate electrosensory cells, on the other hand, contained more free cytosolic vesicles, which by analogy with other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> may represent a larger "refilling pool" of recently generated vesicles available for tethering and release (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, skate cells may be better equipped to continuously supply vesicles for tonic release, reflected by the non-saturating, linear change in C m in response to increasing voltage stimuli.</s></p><p><s>To determine the magnitude of C m change induced by a single V m spike or oscillation, we first integrated I CaV (Q Ca2+ ) elicited by stimuli of varying duration, thereby establishing a relationship between Q Ca2+ and C m (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4e</ref>).</s><s>Shark and skate cells responded equally to identical voltage stimuli, further suggesting that I CaV is similar in both cell types and that K + channel identity dictates the oscillation phenotype and resulting I CaV amplitude (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9b-d</ref>).</s><s>We next fit Q Ca2+ induced by simulated V m spikes or oscillations to Q Ca2+ -C m relationships and used the specific capacitance for a pure lipid membrane of electrosensory cell vesicle diameter to estimate fusion events from measured C m changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Strikingly, our calculations suggest that shark cells released at least 10X more vesicles in response to one V m spike compared to skate cells subjected to a single oscillation event (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4f</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, as with other ribbon synapses, the large storage pool could facilitate sustained release of vesicles in response to repetitive V m spiking, further amplifying signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, these properties should render sharks acutely sensitive to incoming signals by greatly amplifying vesicular release to even very brief stimuli.</s><s>In contrast, skate cells may better encode stimulus variation with tunable voltage oscillations and more graded vesicle release.</s><s>How do differences in V m oscillations and vesicle release at the cellular level contribute to sensation at the organismal level?</s><s>Elasmobranchs preferentially respond to low frequency electrical signals produced by their prey, but direct comparison of frequency selectivity between species is confounded by behavioral and physiological differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>We therefore measured changes in ventilatory rate as a basic, time-locked physiologic metric that is wellvalidated in electroreceptive elasmobranch species and readily observed in response to sensory cues, such as weak electrical stimuli or odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Supplementary videos 1 and 2).</s><s>When presented with electrical stimuli of identical strength, sharks increased ventilation rates similarly at all stimulus frequencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4g</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, skates maximally increased ventilation at low frequencies resembling voltage oscillations in their electrosensory cells or those emitted by their electric organ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4g</ref>).</s><s>In both species, maximal electrically-induced ventilatory responses were similar to those evoked by food odorants as a comparative control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4g</ref>).</s><s>Thus, shark electroreception may act as a threshold detector for broad frequencies, potentially reflecting its role in predation, whereas skate sensation appears more specifically tuned to particular frequencies in the range of conspecific electric organ discharges <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Electroreception has independently evolved in many taxa to facilitate particular behaviors ranging from predation to communication.</s><s>By analyzing related species that use electroreception for distinct purposes, we found that subtle molecular variations significantly alter cellular properties that could ultimately mediate differences in behavior.</s><s>Our results suggest that molecular tuning of electrosensory cell V m oscillations is important for initial detection and discrimination of salient electrical signals, although anatomical characteristics and processing by the central nervous system likely contribute to additional signal filtering (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">10</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>This observation is reminiscent of other sensory modalities in which sensory cells or their receptors are modified to mediate detection of relevant stimuli.</s><s>For example, expression and regulation of ion channels enable hair cells, which are developmentally related to electrosensory cells, to produce V m oscillations of various amplitudes and frequencies to mediate detection of particular auditory signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>While it is not known how broadly voltage oscillation tuning mechanisms apply to electroreception, paddlefish electrosensory organs also express transcripts for Ca V and K + channels, suggesting that similar mechanisms may produce V m oscillations in these systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, weakly electric fish use oscillating or spiking electrosensory organs to facilitate conspecific communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Our results demonstrate one mechanism by which K + channel modification shapes electrosensory cell activity, but regulation of other transduction components could provide alternative tuning mechanisms in distinct species or under specific developmental or physiological states to facilitate dynamic electroreceptive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s></p></div>
