<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Intronic regions are rich in repetitive sequences and longer than exonic regions</head><p><s>Introns are rich in repetitive sequences, containing over double the density of these elements as exonic regions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>These include Long and Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs and SINEs), DNA transposons, tandem and low complexity repeat sequences.</s><s>Most of these genomic features are longer than the 75 -150 nucleotide read length characteristic of current high-throughput RNA sequencing technologies.</s><s>This presents a unique challenge since RNA-optimised mapping algorithms such as Tophat2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, STAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> and MapSplice <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> have filters in place to discard reads that map to more loci than a specific threshold.</s><s>Moreover, counting reads mapping to multiple locations is not straightforward (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, Bai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, have suggested that considering reads mapping to multiple locations introduces "noise" into IR calling and analysis.</s><s>Unfortunately, exclusion of multimapping reads can lead to the loss of biologically important information.</s><s>For example, repetitive sequences have been reported to be the critical functional component of retained introns in rat neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In this case, SINE retrotransposons in retained introns are necessary and sufficient for targeting of cytoplasmic mRNAs to dendrites, while similar repeat elements in the 3' UTR do not alter RNA subcellular localisation.</s><s>Hence, any bioinformatic tool for IR identification and differential analysis which does not include an approach to deal with multi-mapping reads and repetitive sequences in the genome is likely to miss substantial, functionally relevant biological complexity.</s></p><p><s>Introns are significantly longer than exons, reaching up to 500 kbp in some mammals.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, it is difficult to evenly "sample" them to achieve adequate read coverage across their entire length.</s><s>In humans, the average size of exons is 150 nucleotides, and that of introns is 3500 nucleotides <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, meaning that most exons are fully covered by current 150 bp paired-end sequencing approaches, while introns are not.</s><s>There are two contrasting strategies to deal with this challenge as follows.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Pitfalls of splice-junction-only approaches to analyse IR from short read sequencing data</head><p><s>The first approach to deal with long introns involves considering only reads mapping across the splice junctions of interest when calculating IR levels.</s><s>This circumvents the issues described above concerning repetitive sequences within introns, and the issues of adequate normalisation of read coverage across introns of vastly different lengths.</s></p><p><s>However, this approach requires very high read depth, since only ~10 -25% of sequencing reads in a typical paired-end library span one or more splice junctions.</s><s>For example, the developers of VAST-tools, which takes such a junction-read-only approach, recommend at least 70 million reads per sample (ideally &gt;150 million reads) for improved detection and quantitation of all splicing typesnot IR specifically.</s><s>They observe improvement in alternative splicing assessment when read depth is increased to 200 -300 million reads per sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref> .</s><s>If insufficient read depth is observed, conclusions about the background distribution and baseline IR levels can be erroneous.</s><s>Depending on the statistical tests implemented by each tool, this may lead to biased and unreliable analyses.</s><s>Unfortunately, most publically available datasets and experiments carried out without the specific prior aim of alternative splicing characterisation are usually not as deep as this, meaning that using such tools to analyse pre-existing datasets may not be appropriate.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Pitfalls of coverage-based approaches to analyse IR from short read sequencing data</head><p><s>The second strategy considers both junction reads and reads mapping within the body of the intron.</s><s>Tools and protocols that use this approach need to reliably address the mappability issues presented by repetitive elements, and to account for intron length when normalising retention levels between different introns of the same gene or across genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>Such approaches also require relatively high sequencing depth, since they frequently implement a coverage cut-off, where a certain proportion of the intron, or uniquely mappable region of the intron, must be covered by sequencing reads with a minimum depth (for example, 70% of the intron covered at a depth of 5 reads) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>.</s><s>A common caveat with this cut-off is whether to consider the mean number of reads or the median, with most tools using the mean.</s></p><p><s>Unfortunately, this is unlikely to be the best strategy, as the mean is statistically more susceptible to being skewed by outliers than the median.</s><s>Hence, if there is a small repetitive region not masked by mappability assessment, using the mean coverage will inflate the actual level of reads (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Coverage thresholds are especially critical when considering mammalian protein-coding genes, as many of these harbour independently transcribed small RNAs, such as snoRNAs or microRNAs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>If host transcripts are expressed at high levels, and a coverage cut-off is not implemented or used, it might be erroneously concluded that IR affects the coding gene.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Differential gene expression can bias IR detection and quantitation</head><p><s>Any assessment of IR and differential IR must also consider the expression levels of the whole gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>For example, if a gene is highly expressed, it is more likely that reads spanning both inclusion and exclusion splice junctions will be detected in the RNA sequencing library; therefore, passing any coverage, splice junction boundary balance or other cut-off.</s><s>If a differential IR analysis between two tissues is attempted, the differences in gene expression level must be taken into account and subtracted, as these will directly affect detectability of IR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Finally, the fact that many IRTs are subject to NMD adds an additional layer of complexity, as the gene may be observed as expressed at a lower level due to the specific degradation of IRTs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">IR detection can be confounded by antisense transcription</head><p><s>An additional constraint when using next generation sequencing to characterise IR is the abundance of sense and antisense transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>.</s><s>This means that any analyses of IR must take great care in identifying the strand of origin of the observed sequencing reads (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>), and use strand-specific sequencing protocols whenever possible.</s><s>IR detection can be confounded by traces of genomic DNA.</s><s>Thus, care must be taken to ensure effective DNase treatment of RNA samples and confirmation via quality control testing and filters implemented informatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Long read sequencing captures full intron length but is limited by sequencing depth and accuracy</head><p><s>Long read sequencing technologies have been heralded as ground-breaking in improving alternative splicing detection and quantitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, as they circumvent many of the length and mappability challenges outlined above.</s><s>Unfortunately, these technologies are currently limited by their relatively low throughput, high error rates and propensity towards amplification and detection of shorter transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Assessing the extent of IR in species more complex than yeast <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> or beyond a small number of target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> using long read sequencing is currently not readily tractable.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">IR validation rates remain low</head><p><s>Even for dedicated IR studies, validation rates for estimates in the levels of IR remain low.</s><s>For example, one study reported a correlation coefficient (r) of only 0.63 between IR fold-changes determined using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Given the low number of genes validated using qRT-PCR in most studies to date, the best computational approaches capable of providing the most robust IR predictions remain to be determined.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Best practices for informatic IR analysis</head><p><s>To circumvent the challenges described above, for both junction-based and coveragebased IR analysis, strand-specific sequencing should be carried out, and followed by a robust assessment of whether the read depth is adequate to sample intronic regions.</s><s>This can be done by subsampling reads and examining splice junction or intron coverage statistics.</s><s>If a junction based IR assessment approach is chosen, more sequencing depth will be required, while if a coverage-based approach is selected mappability assessment must be incorporated into the mapping and intron quantitation.</s><s>Both strategies also require a filtering step to segregate IR in differentially expressed genes from IR in non-differentially expressed genes, with estimates for the latter frequently being more robust and reliable.</s><s>Finally, new computational techniques need to be developed to incorporate data generated by longread sequencing with short-read data, and benchmarking studies of best practices for IR detection, normalisation and quantitation similar to those available for differential gene expression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref> need to be carried out.</s></p></div>
