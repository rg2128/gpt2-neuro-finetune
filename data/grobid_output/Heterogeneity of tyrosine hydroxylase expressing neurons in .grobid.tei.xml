(2017)</ref> examined the synaptic connections of small dopaminergic JG neurons with the electron microscopic serial section-reconstruction; the neurons reconstructed were shown to extend their dendrites into glomeruli and receive numerous asymmetrical synapses from ON terminals, M/T dendrites and non-ON terminals and a few symmetrical synapses from presumed GABAergic processes and make symmetrical synapses mainly to M/T dendrites.</s><s>These features appears to correspond to those of PG cells, especially "type 1 PG cells" as suggested in their paper J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kiyokage et al. 2017)</ref>, although the authors used just the term "TH-expressing JG cells" instead of PG cells and short-axon cells.</s><s>In the present study we could not confirm the axonic processes in most SPG cells, but we encountered a few dopaminergic SPG cells displaying thin axonic processes although almost of them were AnkG negative.</s><s>There might be both axonic and anaxonic dopaminergic SPG cells; the former might correspond to the classical PG cells.</s></p><p><s>In the present study we revealed the structural features of the larger type of dopaminergic JG cells.</s><s>They displayed dendritic processes located in one to several glomeruli usually making tufts and apparent axonal processes extending rather distantly as well as near their somata and penetrating into glomeruli.</s><s>The overall structural features might correspond well to those of classical PG cells described above but their larger sizes.</s><s>Thus we would like to name them "large periglomerular cells LPG cells", whereas the smaller type of PG cells, both axonic and anaxonic ones, might be named "small periglomerular cells SPG cells."</s><s>Furthermore it seems comprehensible that these LPG cells could be regarded as "external tufted cells" if we had not known their GABAergic nature.</s></p><p><s>Most of the dopaminergic JG neurons with AIS shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3</ref> of their paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Galliano et al.

(2017)</ref>.</s><s>Clasping cells were defined by several characteristics of their dendritic processes: dense dendritic arborizations clasping around other JG somata, dendrites mostly ramifying in the JG space of the GL, and no dendritic branches in the EPL.</s><s>In addition, Bywalez et al.</s></p><p><s>(2017) described as follows; "If these dendrites ever entered the glomerular neuropil (in 8 out of 16 fully reconstructed cells with parent glomerulus), they did so only in a restricted fashion, namely within mostly superficial volumes of one particular glomerulus.</s><s>No substantial projection into any additional glomeruli was observed."</s></p><p><s>Thus the incrusting cells we named in the present study resembled the clasping cells in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f overall structural features.</s><s>The clasping cells might be considered as a particular subtype of the incrusting cells.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bywalez et al.
