<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p><s>Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme constitutional types allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system level differences in normal individuals which could lead to differential disease predisposition.</s><s>This is a first attempt towards unraveling the clinical phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern biology.</s><s>An integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise for future predictive medicine.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Genome wide expression as well as genetic marker studies reveal that most genetic variation is due to inter-individual differences at genetic loci within populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The enormous heterogeneity in expression and sequence variation of genes coupled with genetic network interactions and environmental factors contributes to phenotypic diversity in health and disease.</s><s>In the Ayurveda system of medicine, predisposition to a disease as well as selection of a preventive and curative regime is primarily based on phenotypic assessment of a person which includes one's body constitution termed "Prakriti".</s><s>Prakriti is a consequence of the relative proportion of three entities (Tri-Doshas), Vata (V), Pitta (P) and Kapha (K), which are not only genetically determined (Shukra Shonita), but also influenced by environment (Mahabhuta Vikara), maternal diet and lifestyle (Matur Ahara Vihara), and age of the transmitting parents (Kala-Garbhashaya) (see Additional <ref type="bibr">File 1)</ref>.</s><s>In an individual, the Tri-Doshas work in conjunction and maintain homeostasis throughout the lifetime starting from fertilization.</s><s>Distinct properties and functions have been ascribed to each Dosha.</s><s>For instance, Vata contributes to manifestation of shape, cell division, signaling, movement, excretion of wastes, cognition and also regulates the activities of Kapha and Pitta.</s><s>Kapha is responsible for anabolism, growth and maintenance of structure, storage and stability.</s><s>Pitta is primarily responsible for metabolism, thermo-regulation, energy homeostasis, pigmentation, vision, and host surveillance.</s><s>Much as it would sound surprising, but the sanskrit version of the modern terms described above exists in the ancient texts (see Additional File 1).</s><s>Thus phenotypic diversity, according to Ayurveda, is a consequence of a continuum of relative proportions of Doshas resulting in seven possible constitutional types namely Vata, Pitta, Kapha, Vata-Pitta, Pitta-Kapha, Vata-Kapha and Vata-Pitta-Kapha.</s><s>Amongst these, the first three are considered as extremes, exhibiting readily recognizable phenotypes, and are more predisposed to specific diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In an earlier study, correlation of specific HLA-DRB1 polymorphisms with Prakriti has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Recently an attempt has also been made to integrate Ayurveda with functional genomics to identify pathways associated with activity of crude and active components of a herb, Ashwagandha, which is used for cancer treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, to investigate the Ayurvedic system of phenotypic classification in molecular terms, we examined the possibility of identifying genome wide expression and biochemical differences amongst the Prakriti types.</s><s>We considered gene expression for correlation because it is a better measure of functional variation at the molecular level and can also be mapped more effectively to biological processes and pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>It has also been recently demonstrated that genetic variations underlie variations in gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>As a first step we analyzed normal healthy individuals belonging to the three most contrasting groups -Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of questionnaire for Prakriti assessment</head><p><s>A questionnaire for clinical phenotyping was designed on the basis of Ayurvedic literature on phenotypes and methods of Prakriti assessment (see Additional File 1).</s><s>The phenotypic classification, broadly, takes into account criteria for defining anatomical features like body built, body frame, size and symmetry of body parts, physiology, physical endurance and aptitudes.</s><s>Besides, the questionnaire also captures information pertaining to ethnicity, family history of diseases etc.</s><s>Each of the questions has multiple options to choose from, and each of the options further refers to it being a property attributed to either V, P or K (see questionnaire as Additional File 2 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Individuals who had thin and narrow body frame, weakly developed body build, with irregular appetite, food and bowel habits, difficulty in gaining weight, quick at physical activities, dry skin and hair, and less tolerance for cold temperature were considered as Vata Prakriti.</s><s>Individuals with moderately developed build, high frequency of appetite and thirst, good digestive power, perspiration tendency higher than normal, tolerance for cold weather, moderately mobile with moderate physical strength were identified as Pitta Prakriti.</s><s>Individuals who had broad body frames with well developed body build, tendency to gain weight, low appetite and digestion, preferred to be less mobile, less forgetful and with good healing power and cool temperament, were selected as Kapha individuals.</s></p><p><s>We also developed an automated software for parsing and calculating scores of V, P, K in an individual using a 0/1 against V/P/K for each of the questions depending on a no or yes answer respectively.</s><s>Cumulative scores of V, P and K is calculated in each individual through the software without the intervention of the Ayurveda expert.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical phenotyping and identification of volunteers</head><p><s>The identification of individuals of predominant Prakriti types were carried out by two Ayurveda physicians (co authors of this paper).</s><s>In order to avoid any confounding observations due to population stratification the study was conducted on Indo-European speaking large populations predominantly from North India.</s><s>A preliminary assessment of Prakriti was carried out on a total of 850 volunteers, nearly half by each of the two clinicians using subjective assessment and a screening questionnaire.</s><s>The short-listing of individuals to be recruited for detailed phenotyping was also carried out independently.</s><s>The short-listed individuals were swapped between the two clinicians and were assessed in detail for their Prakriti using the questionnaire (see Additional File 2).</s><s>These comprised of nearly 120 individuals of predominant Prakriti and 200 individuals of heterogeneous Prakriti.</s><s>There was nearly 80% concordance observed in Prakriti assessment between two clinicians.</s><s>Subsequently 96 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals with predominance of either Vata (39 individuals), Pitta <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> or Kapha <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> were identified and included equal numbers of both genders (n = 48 in each case) and belonged to an age group of 18 -40 years (mean age ~23 ± 4 years).</s></p></div>
