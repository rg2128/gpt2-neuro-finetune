<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intersectional genetic strategies to map the projections of midbrain DA neuron subtypes</head><p><s>We next devised three distinct intersectional genetic strategies to target putative DA neuron subtypes.</s><s>Strategy I uses a reporter mouse that labels with tdTomato only cells that express both Cre and Flpo recombinases (Ai65) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>This approach is not limited by the diffusion of viral particles and therefore provides a more complete picture of the intersectional neuron population.</s><s>However, one limitation of this approach is that several Cre lines may intersect with Th expression outside the midbrain, thereby labeling unwanted cells.</s><s>Additionally for genes that have broader expression in DA neurons during development, this approach will label more cells than represented by the adult gene expression pattern.</s><s>Strategy II exploits the INTRSECT viral system <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , in which EYFP expression is activated uniquely in cells that express Cre and Flpo recombinases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>By virtue of targeted viral delivery, this strategy has the advantage of avoiding most other TH+ populations in the brain, as well as labeling adult neurons based on their ongoing, rather than developmental, expression of Cre and Flpo.</s><s>Strategy III uses a Dat-tTA strain (tetracycline transactivator driven by the Slc6a3 (Dat) locus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ), in conjunction with the intersectional reporter mouse Ai82 17 , in which EGFP expression is driven by tetracycline response element (TRE) in a Cre dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>The Dat locus has the advantage of being largely restricted to midbrain DA neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , barring few other neuronal populations (e.g.</s><s>ventral premmamillary nucleus, PMv <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ).</s><s>Together these complementary approaches form a powerful arsenal to target molecularly distinct DA neurons.</s></p><p><s>To validate Strategy I and to establish a pan-midbrain DA neuron projection map, we obtained Th-2A-Flpo;Dat-ires-Cre;Ai65 mice as well as control littermates.</s><s>In mice with both Th-2A-Flpo and Dat-ires-Cre alleles, but not in controls, we observed strong fluorescence in midbrain DA neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>We also observed tdTomato expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH), but none in the PMv.</s><s>Since ARH DA neurons do not contribute to ascending DAergic pathways 2 , these experiments revealed ascending DA pathways in their entirety, which was neither possible using the Th nor Dat promoter alone.</s><s>As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>, tdTomato+ axonal fibers were observed in all known DA recipient regions.</s><s>Thus, this intersectional genetic strategy provides a comprehensive picture of the projections of midbrain DA neurons.</s><s>To establish the fidelity of Strategy II, we injected AAV--CreON,FlpON-EYFP virus in the SNc of mice with only the Th-2A-Flpo or Dat-ires-Cre allele, as well as mice with both alleles.</s><s>In mice with both Flpo and Cre alleles, but not either one alone, we observed strong fluorescence in DA neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Lastly, we validated Strategy III with Dat-ires-Cre;Dat-tTA;Ai82 mice, and observed robust fluorescence in DA cell bodies and axonal projections, but not in controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>These experiments demonstrate that our three complementary intersectional strategies display fidelity, and therefore allow analysis of genetically-defined DA neuron projections.</s></p></div>
