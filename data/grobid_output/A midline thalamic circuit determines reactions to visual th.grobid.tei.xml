<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>vMT neurons modulate threat responses</head><p><s>To further assess the functional role of the vMT, mice were stereotaxically injected with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing hM4Di (G i/o -coupled human muscarinic M 4 designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD)) tagged with mCherry (AAV-hSyn-hM4Di-mCherry) (n = 9 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2a-e</ref>).</s><s>Control mice (n = 9) received injections of a virus lacking DREADD (for example, AAV-hSyn-mCherry).</s><s>Other mice (n = 15) received injections of AAV-hSyn-hM3Dq-mCherry (G q -coupled human muscarinic M 3 DREADD) into the vMT.</s><s>hM4Di and hM3Dq receptors bind clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and cause robust decreases or increases, respectively, in the firing of central nervous-system neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2b</ref>).</s><s>vMT neurons expressing hM4Di and exposed to CNO showed a significant decrease in c-Fos activation, whereas a significant increase in c-Fos activation occurred in vMT neurons expressing hM3Dq (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Marked differences in responses to looming were observed between the three groups of mice.</s><s>Control mice displayed normal ratios of behaviours, with freezing and hiding accounting for the vast majority of the loom-stimulus presentation time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2f,</ref><ref type="figure">i,</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Mice in which hM4Di-mCherry was expressed in the vMT and CNO had been administered (that is, mice in which the vMT was inactivated), showed normal responses to overhead looming stimuli by freezing or running to hide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2g,</ref><ref type="figure">i,</ref>); however, the overall number of mice exhibiting tail rattling was reduced from 3 out of 9 control mice to 0 out of 9 vMT-inactivated mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2f</ref>, k, Supplementary Video 3).</s></p><p><s>Considerable shifts in the behavioural responses to overhead looms were observed in mice that expressed hM3Dq and were treated with CNO (that is, mice in which the vMT was activated).</s><s>Although the mice hid at normal frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2h</ref>, i, r), they exhibited significant increases in the number (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2h,</ref><ref type="figure">j,</ref><ref type="figure">o</ref>) and duration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2i</ref>) of tail-rattling episodes, most of which occurred outside the confines of the shelter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2h</ref>, l, Supplementary Video 4).</s><s>The overall percentage of mice exhibiting tail rattling was also significantly increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2k</ref>).</s><s>Tail rattling is associated with aggression in male mice before fighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and in female mice eliciting maternal territorial behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , although it can reflect non-aggressive states as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>We observed significant increases in tail rattling in both male and female mice, with no sex differences (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Although the emotional state associated with tail rattling is unclear, it unequivocally increases the visual and auditory saliency of the mouse to predators (Supplementary Video 4).</s><s>Mice treated with both hM3Dq and CNO also displayed significantly more walking (duration) and running (incidence), with the vast majority of this locomotion occurring within the open arena (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> i, j, m, p).</s><s>Overall, we observed a significant shift towards more motile behaviours in mice treated with both hM3Dq and CNO compared to control mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2n,</ref><ref type="figure">s</ref>), and a shift away from immotile, saliency-reducing behaviours (for example, freezing and hiding).</s><s>No increase in the amount of motile behaviour occurred in the absence of visual threats (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, vMT influences action selection in response to threats, but does not influence locomotor behaviour in itself.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distinct threat responses by vMT outputs</head><p><s>Next we explored the structure and function of vMT output circuitry.</s><s>We injected AAV-XFP into the vMT (n = 12 mice;

this resulted in specific infection of the hM3Dq-mCherry/Cre + neurons that project to mPFC (vMT→mPFC; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3m</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>We then injected these mice with CNO to selectively activate vMT→mPFC circuitry.</s><s>This caused a significant increase in tail-rattling events compared to controls, but did not change freezing or hiding behaviours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3n</ref>, q, r).</s></p><p><s>In both the vMT→mPFC-activated and the vMT→mBLA-activated mice, we observed mCherry + axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), suggesting that axonal projections from the vMT bifurcate to innervate the NAc.</s><s>Anterograde tracing from the vMT with AAV-GFP confirmed this (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3a-d</ref>).</s><s>We tested whether the vMT→NAc pathway altered behavioural responses to looming (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), but found that it did not (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3g</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, the vMT→mPFC and the vMT→BLA circuits determine the behavioural responses to visually threatening stimuli.</s></p><p><s>To specifically activate the vMT→mPFC pathway and not the bifurcated NAc axons, we injected AAV-ChR2-eYFP (ChR2, channelrhodopsin-2; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> into the vMT and implanted a fibre-optic cannula above the mPFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3o</ref>).</s><s>Upon optogenetic stimulation of the vMT→mPFC pathway, 100% of mice exhibited tail rattling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3p</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>The stimulation of vMT→mPFC terminals significantly increased tail rattling (duration and incidence) and running (incidence) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3p-r</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, these data reveal that each of the two divergent outputs of the vMT determines a unique set of responses to visually threatening stimuli: the vMT→mPFC circuit increases tail rattling and motile behaviours, and the vMT→BLA circuit suppresses these behaviours and encourages freezing instead, effects that do not simply reflect differences in the number of infected neurons in each condition (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4a-d</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of vMT activation prior to loom exposure</head><p><s>To understand further how the vMT affects behavioural response selection to visual threats, we again used virally-expressed ChR2 (n = 32 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4a</ref>) and varied the timing of vMT activation relative to loom presentations.</s><s>In the first condition, the vMT was stimulated at the same time as the presentation of the loom stimulus (Supplementary Video 5).</s><s>Control mice with AAV-GFP expressed in the vMT, but no ChR2, showed normal loom responses (n = 17 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, mice with ChR2 expressed and blue light stimulation presented in concert with the looming stimulus exhibited significant increases in both the duration and incidence of tail rattling and running (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Overall, vMT stimulation together with looming significantly increased saliency-enhancing behaviours, and decreased saliency-reducing behaviours such as freezing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4e,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next we asked whether vMT stimulation before looming also induces shifts in the behavioural responses of mice.</s><s>We stimulated the vMT for 30 s before any exposure to looming stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4d</ref>) (n = 15).</s><s>This induced a remarkably similar pattern of effects to vMT stimulation in concert with looms; in both cases, the mice displayed significantly increased saliency-enhancing behaviours, such as tail rattling and running, compared to controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4e-g</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that vMT stimulation causes a shift in the internal state of the mouse and does not somehow alter visual perception in itself.</s></p><p><s>To further test the idea that vMT activation shifts mice towards states that favour saliency enhancing responses to threat, we exposed a subset of mice to a visual 'sweep' stimulus, which reliably induces freezing but not escape and/or hiding behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4h,</ref><ref type="figure">i,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>Activating the vMT with ChR2 and blue light during the presentation of visual sweeps significantly reduced the amount of sweep-induced freezing and promoted saliency enhancing behaviours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>ChR2-induced activation of the vMT also significantly reduced freezing and avoidance of olfactory threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , and increased saliency-enhancing ambulatory and approach behaviours (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6a-c</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>vMT firing scales with perceived threat</head><p><s>Next we carried out single-unit tetrode recordings from freely behaving mice before, during and after exposure to looming stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6a</ref>; see Methods).</s><s>Example spiking activity from five different vMT cells in response to the first round of looming stimuli is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6b</ref>.</s><s>Four out of five cells showed increased firing to looms relative to the pre-loom condition.</s><s>Overall, the firing rates of vMT neurons increased by approximately 30% in response to looms on the first day of loom exposure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6c</ref>), which is when the most robust behavioural responses to loom occur.</s></p><p><s>Aligning vMT-spiking activity with the behaviours exhibited during looming showed that vMT spiking scaled with the degree to which the mice exhibited different behavioural responses.</s><s>The firing rates of vMT neurons markedly increased when the mouse tail-rattled, walked or ran, but not when the mouse froze (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6d</ref>).</s><s>Overall, there was a significant increase in vMT firing when the mouse exhibited saliency-enhancing behaviours as opposed to saliency-reducing behaviours to looming (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6d-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>It is well established that mice habituate their responses when looming is repeatedly presented over several days <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>We explored whether vMT firing adjusts to those changes, and found that the relative pre-loom versus loom firing rate of vMT neurons attenuated in parallel with the behavioural attenuation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6g</ref>), an effect also seen with c-Fos (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that the firing of vMT neurons scales according to the novelty of a threat stimulus, and in a way predicts the changes in behavioural responses to visual threats over time.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We show that when vMT neurons are activated before, or during, simulated predator looms or olfactory threat, mice shift from saliency-reducing to saliency-enhancing reactions to those threats.</s><s>Whereas looms typically induce freezing, activation of the vMT or the vMT→mPFC pathway induced tail rattling-a behaviour associated with aggression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .</s><s>Although the range of emotional states represented by behaviours such as tail rattling is likely to be broad, saliency-enhancing behaviours in general can be thought of as 'courageous' because they increase the visibility of the mouse in the direct presence of a perceived threat.</s><s>Indeed, from the perspective of predator-prey interactions, avoiding predation reflects a trade-off between avoiding detection (for example, freezing, hiding or camouflage) and avoiding capture (for example, running or fighting); which category of behaviour is adaptive requires ongoing risk assessment.</s><s>Our data indicate that arousal level appears to bias which category of behavioural response mice will exhibit in response to threats (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>).</s><s>Activation of the vMT consistently increased arousal and saliency-enhancing 'courageous' behaviours to threats.</s><s>This is unlikely to indicate increased stress because our real-time place preference test showed that the internal state caused by vMT activation is rewarding (that is, it has positive valence).</s><s>In light of this, it is notable that at least two previous studies found that self-stimulation of the human brain area that is homologous <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> to the rodent vMT is strongly reinforcing, even more so than activation of areas associated with sexual arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The vMT structures described here reside well outside the primary visual pathway and receive diverse sources of input from sensory structures, including the superior colliculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , as well as from hindbrain areas associated with arousal and emotion, such as the raphe and the periaqueductal grey <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the vMT may act as a hub for integrating several types of sensory inputs with internal states in order to select specific categories of behavioural outputs.</s><s>In contrast to the vast inputs to the vMT, the outputs of the vMT are fairly restricted: they include the basolateral amygdala, the medial prefrontal cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and the nucleus accumbens (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), structures all shown previously to be associated with fear and/or reinforcement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Our data point to the powerful influence that activation of thalamic midline structures can have on arousal and behavioural responses to threatening stimuli.</s><s>Other midline-residing structures-such as the ventromedial hypothalamus and the periaqueductal grey-have been shown by others to control aggression and arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , which raises ideas about whether midline nuclei of the hind-, mid-and forebrain may represent a larger circuit devoted to sensory-autonomic modulation.</s><s>In the future, experiments that adjust the activity of several brain areas such as the periaqueductal grey, the ventromedial hypothalamus and the vMT could shed light on this idea.</s><s>The strong convergence of circuitries involved in arousal, reward and action selection to perceived threats in structures such as the vMT also raises the possibility that dysregulation of midline thalamic function may underlie disorders of these processes such as addiction, phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder.</s></p></div>
