more ancient midbrain, it has been implicated in a range of cognitive functions from arousal and vigilance to attention and learning, and even consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Everitt and Robbins, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hasselmo and Sarter, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Cholinergic cell loss is a major feature of multiple diseases of cognition: the severity of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's dementia is correlated with the extent of deterioration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Whitehouse et al., 1982)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, deep brain stimulation of the basal forebrain is being tested as a therapeutic option for dementia, and can improve the cognitive symptoms of some Alzheimer's and Parkinson-dementia patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Freund et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kuhn et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, progressive degeneration of central cholinergic neurons is thought to play a key role in neurodegenerative dementias and agerelated cognitive decline, lending acute pathophysiological significance to basal forebrain research.</s></p><p><s>It may not be surprising then, that perturbations of the central cholinergic system affect a wide range of behaviors.</s><s>Rodents with selective lesions of cholinergic neurons, pharmacological blockade of acetylcholine receptors or optogenetic suppression of cholinergic activity show performance deficits in detecting and discriminating sensory stimuli <ref

performance.</s></p><p><s>Nonetheless it remains unclear why behavioral performance decreases after loss of cholinergic tone, and the possible underlying mechanisms range from arousal to attention to learning processes.</s><s>To gain insight into these processes, it is critical to first understand at what time scales the firing of cholinergic neurons vary with behavioral performance.</s><s>For instance, fast modulation of cortical arousal might occur within a behavioral trial, leading to a trial-by-trial co-variation of cholinergic activity and behavioral performance.</s><s>On the other hand, slow but steady decrease in vigilance throughout a behavioral session due to a concomitant diminution of cholinergic firing could lead to deterioration of behavioral performance.</s><s>Importantly these possibilities would be expected to lead to similar changes in overall behavioral accuracy that are difficult to disentangle.</s></p><p><s>Therefore we reasoned that determining the conditions under which cholinergic neurons are normally active is essential for revealing their behavioral functions across multiple time scales.</s><s>Although there have been some recordings of unidentified neurons from the basal forebrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lin and Nicolelis, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Richardson and DeLong, 1991;</ref><ref

reasons for this are twofold.</s><s>First, cholinergic neurons lie deep in the forebrain intermingled with other cell types including two cortically projecting populations, GABAergic and glutamatergic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Freund and Gulyás, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gritti et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gritti et al., , 2006))</ref>.</s><s>In addition, they lack distinguishing spike shape features or firing characteristics that could aid identification.</s><s>Second, the cholinergic basal forebrain is comprised of a number of topographically projecting nuclei representing a high degree of anatomical complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Saper, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zaborszky et al., 2013)</ref>, including the prefrontally projecting horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB) and the auditory/parietal cortex projecting caudal nucleus basalis (NB).</s><s>Auditory projecting cholinergic neurons of the caudal nucleus basalis are present in a thin sheet on the lateral border of the internal capsule, making these experiments technically challenging even in the era of optogenetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lehmann et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Saper, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zaborszky et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Here we recorded identified cholinergic neurons from both the NB and the HDB during behavior for the first time.</s><s>We report surprising dynamics of cholinergic firing including exceptionally fast and precise responses to innate reward (water) and punishment (air puff) -collectively referred to as primary reinforcers.</s><s>The responses of cholinergic neurons were indistinguishable between the two nuclei despite their different projection targets, suggesting they constitute a unified broadcast system to cortex.</s><s>Finally, we constructed a computational model to understand the variations in cholinergic responses and found they could be explained as responding to reinforcement surprise, showing stronger activation after unexpected reinforcement.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optogenetic identification of central cholinergic neurons</head><p><s>We sought to record identified basal forebrain cholinergic neurons to determine when and how they are recruited during behavior.</s><s>We targeted two distinct nuclei of the cholinergic basal forebrain.</s><s>First, we identified the auditory projecting portion of the nucleus basalis (NB) revealed by retrograde tracing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, bottom).</s><s>Second, we performed recordings from the prefrontally projecting horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB).</s><s>These two nuclei are not only far apart (1.5 mm) but send non-overlapping cortical projections that are thought to underlie distinct functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nelson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Parikh et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Virtually all cholinergic cells are projection neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zaborszky et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Zaborszky et al., , 2013))</ref>, obviating the need for retrograde or antidromic identification of a projection subpopulation.</s><s>However, both NB and HDB contain a diversity of cell-types, including GABAergic and glutamatergic projection neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Freund and Gulyás, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gritti et al., 1997)</ref> that lack distinct electrophysiological signatures or pharmacological properties that could enable identification in extracellular recordings.</s><s>Therefore we used optogenetic tagging to identify cholinergic neurons in extracellular recordings.</s><s>We rendered cholinergic neurons lightsensitive using either viral transfection to deliver channelrhodopsin-2 in ChAT-Cre mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), or a ChAT-ChR2 mouse line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A-F</ref>; we observed no differences between the two lines, see Experimental Procedures).</s><s>We recorded well-isolated single units and delivered brief (1 ms) blue light-pulses to elicit short-latency action potentials.</s><s>Cholinergic neurons were identified by their significant short latency light-responses (n = 34 out of 1580 units, p &lt; 0.01, SALT test for optogenetic identification; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C-E</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1G-K</ref>).</s><s>Note that only around 6% of the basal forebrain neurons are cholinergic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gritti et al., 2006)</ref> and since our methods are designed to minimize false positives they might have missed some cholinergic cells because of insufficient viral infection or light access (see Experimental Procedures).</s></p><p><s>Slow fluctuations of cortical acetylcholine levels have been long hypothesized to mediate gradual changes of vigilance or arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Buzsaki et al., 1988)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore we first examined whether the baseline firing of cholinergic neurons was correlated with behavioral and brain states in freely moving mice.</s><s>Video tracking data were used to differentiate segments of sleep (no motion, accompanied by delta band, 1-4 Hz oscillations in cortical local field potentials) and quiet wakefulness (characterized by head movements without locomotion) from freely moving epochs <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1F,</ref><ref type="bibr">see Experimental Procedures)</ref>.</s><s>Cholinergic neurons showed the highest activity in freely moving mice (5.0 ± 1.4 Hz, median ± s.e.; n = 5; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>), which decreased during quiet wakefulness (4.0 ± 1.7 Hz) and further in sleep (2.0 ± 1.1 Hz), in agreement with previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hassani et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lee et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p></div>

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>Head-fixed mice (n = 22) were trained to detect two pure tones, well separated at distinct frequencies, and respond to the 'go' tone with a lick while ignoring the 'no-go' tone.</s><s>Responses to the 'go' tone were considered hits and resulted in the delivery of a drop of water reward, while responses to the 'no-go' tone constituted false alarms triggering a mild puff of air directed to the face as punishment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Thirsty mice learned to lick for water (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, left) and avoid air puffs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, right; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), thus demonstrating that water and air puff have positive and negative motivational value, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cohen et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Mice consistently responded to air puffs by blinking, likely reflecting the aversive quality of the punishment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>To make the task attention-demanding, the stimulus was presented at unexpected moments following the trial start signal and tones of varying loudness were interleaved across trials in a whitenoise background to create graded difficulty levels.</s><s>Mice performed the task well and their accuracy and reaction time (RT) varied systematically as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>, F;

p &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney test, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A-C</ref>).</s><s>This was characteristic both to NB (n = 19/22) and HDB (n = 11/12) cholinergic neurons despite their anatomical separation and distinct projection targets.</s></p><p><s>Encouraged by the phasic nature of cholinergic activation after punishment, we further examined its temporal properties.</s><s>The phasic activation of NB cholinergic neurons showed remarkably short latency (17.5 ± 0.6 ms, median ± s.e; range, 15-31 ms; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>) and extremely high temporal precision (jitter, 3.2 ± 0.7 ms), unexpected for a neuromodulatory system.</s><s>Cholinergic neurons either fired a single spike or a brief burst of action potentials in response to punishment, with high reliability (76.9 ± 6.2%; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>).</s><s>Within the narrow range of spike latencies, shorter response times were associated with higher spike counts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>; p &lt; 0.01 for 8 out of 11 neurons firing at least three bursts; remaining 3/11 p-values, p = 0.011, p = 0.06, p = 0.14), consistent with stronger excitatory drive.</s><s>Similar to NB, identified cholinergic neurons recorded from the HDB also exhibited fast response kinetics (median latency, 18.7 ± 2.3 ms; jitter, 3.8 ± 2.9 ms excluding two neurons showing atypical 220-230 ms activation with 15 ms onset; reliability, 75.5 ± 8.4%).</s><s>Such rapid punishment-elicited responses may be either related to cues associated with punishment (termination of the stimulus, touch of air on the face or click of the air valve) or the execution of a stereotypic motor program (mouth opening or licking).</s><s>To dissociate these possibilities, we introduced a variable delay (200-400 ms Gaussian, s.d.</s><s>= 30 ms) between the animal's motor response and the feedback (punishment or reward) delivery (n = 16 cholinergic neurons).</s><s>We found that the phasic activation of cholinergic neurons was aligned to the timing of feedback and not the animals' motor response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A-B</ref>).</s><s>This demonstrates that the rapid activation of cholinergic neurons was triggered by sensory cues associated with the behavioral feedback and not motor events.</s></p><p><s>Because air puff punishment acts as an innate, primary reinforcer we hypothesized that rapid, unconditional neural responses to reinforcers should also occur outside of task performance.</s><s>To test this we delivered air puffs at random, unsignaled moments to head fixed mice.</s><s>All cholinergic neurons (n = 6 neurons from 5 mice; 2 from NB and 4 from HDB) showed fast, reliable activation after air puff delivery (p &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney test; median latency, 19.8 ± 5.5 ms; jitter, 3.7 ± 2.7 ms; reliability, 70.6 ± 14.5%; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>In addition, one NB cholinergic neuron also responded to mild foot shocks (latency, 9.5 ms;
