<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Well-isolated V1 neurons were recorded from two rhesus monkeys while performing a task that required fast detection of a visual stimulus.</s><s>The recordings were obtained by using an implantable, multielectrode/microdrive array with ultra-thin electrodes 30 that allowed us to study each neuron for several hours.</s><s>The recording stability combined with the excellent spike isolation allowed us to measure the response properties from each neuron with great level of detail (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In addition to quantifying response modulations to spatial attention and task difficulty, we also measured orientation tuning, direction selectivity, spatial frequency tuning, receptive-field structure (by reverse correlation analysis), response latency, color selectivity, contrast sensitivity, spike width, interspike-interval distribution, response linearity (F1/F0) and spontaneous firing rate for each neuron.</s><s>A main goal of this study was to characterize the functional properties of neurons that are modulated by spatial attention and task difficulty, so as to identify the specific types of neurons that mediate attentional effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of spatial attention and task difficulty</head><p><s>During the recordings, monkeys held a bar and fixated a small cross while attending to one of five peripheral drifting gratings, which was cued at the beginning of each trial (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The five gratings had different spatial locations but they were all identical in orientation and direction of movement, spatial frequency, temporal frequency and size (matching the response properties of the neuron studied).</s><s>After a randomized period of time that lasted 1.5-3 seconds, the cued grating changed color and the monkey indicated the color change by releasing the bar as fast as possible (shorter reaction times resulted in larger rewards; reaction times longer than 500 ms were not rewarded).</s><s>Response modulations to spatial attention and task difficulty were measured within the 500 ms preceding the color change (1-2.5 seconds after the cue was turned off, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">top</ref>).</s><s>The color change could be either easy or hard to detect (due to the change in its color/luminance contrast) and it could take place either inside or outside of the neuron's receptive field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>The level of task difficulty was adjusted in each recording session to obtain reaction times that were significantly longer during the hard task than the easy task (P &lt; 0.05 in Wilcoxon test).</s><s>The cue was blocked for both spatial location and difficulty for 20 or more consecutive trials so that the monkeys could maximize their effort within a trial block (i.e. if the first trial was difficult to detect, the monkeys knew that the following trials would be also difficult and would need to increase their effort to maximize reward).</s><s>We studied visual responses from 92 neurons at two or more different levels of task difficulty and two spatial locations of attention.</s><s>We also measured in detail the response properties of each neuron (average recording duration: 1.6 hours; see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>During the easy task, the monkeys detected the color change rapidly (average reaction time: 337 ± 47 ms) and made few mistakes (percentage of rewarded bar releases: 98%), but only 8 out of 92 V1 neurons (8%) were modulated by spatial attention (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, top; see methods for data on each monkey).</s><s>During the hard task, the reaction times were significantly higher (394 ± 61 ms, P &lt; 0.0001 Wilcoxon test), errors were more frequent (percentage of rewarded bar releases: 86%) and 39 out of 92 neurons in V1 (42%) were modulated by spatial attention (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, bottom; all cells modulated by attention during the easy task were also modulated during the hard task).</s><s>We selected the cells that were significantly modulated by attention for further analysis (n = 39, red bars in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, P &lt; 0.05 in Wilcoxon test, see Methods for measurements of significance).</s><s>Throughout the text, visual responses measured in the four different conditions of task difficulty and spatial attention will be referred to as E (responses during the easy task), H (responses during the hard task), I (responses while the focus of attention was inside the receptive field) and O (responses while the focus of attention was outside the receptive field).</s></p><p><s>The modulation of V1 visual responses by spatial attention and task difficulty are illustrated with two representative cell examples in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The top of the figure shows the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of the visual responses driven by the last grating cycle before the color change (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> for details about the temporal course of stimulus and response).</s><s>Each PSTH shows responses to different levels of difficulty (easy in blue, hard in red and intermediate in black) and different spatial locations of attention (left: attention inside the receptive field; right: attention outside the receptive field).</s><s>The panels below the PSTHs illustrate different functional properties measured in each neuron (i.e.</s><s>spike width, interspike interval distribution, receptive field, direction selectivity and spatial frequency tuning).</s><s>As illustrated in this figure, the most pronounced effect of increasing task difficulty in cell_a (from an easy to a hard task) was response enhancement when spatial attention was located inside the receptive field.</s><s>In contrast, the most pronounced effect of increasing task difficulty in cell_b was response suppression when attention was located outside the receptive field.</s><s>Cell_a and cell_b differed in several other response properties.</s><s>Cell_b had wider spike waveforms and a tighter interspike-interval distribution than cell_a.</s><s>Moreover, unlike cell_a, cell_b was direction selective, color selective (not shown) and it could not be visually driven with sparse noise stimuli (light and dark spots presented for 40 ms within the receptive field).</s><s>Other properties such as spatial frequency tuning and Fourier harmonic F1/F0 ratio were similar in both cells.</s></p><p><s>On average, the attentional ratio [(I -O)/(I + O)] of attention-modulated V1-cells was 0.09 during the hard task, which corresponds to a mean response enhancement of 22% [(I -O)/I * 100] when spatial attention was located inside versus outside the receptive field.</s><s>In contrast, the average attentional ratio during the easy task was significantly lower, 0.03 (P &lt; 0.0001 Wilcoxon test), which corresponds to a modest enhancement of just 7% when attention was inside versus outside the receptive field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Clearly, increasing task difficulty made the attentional modulations much stronger within area V1, from a 7% modulation, which matches some V1 measurements in previous studies 21 , to a 22% modulation, which approaches the modulations measured in higher cortical areas 8, 10, 21 .</s></p><p><s>The effect of task difficulty on visual responses was spatially specific.</s><s>Increasing task difficulty (from an easy to a hard task) enhanced the visual responses of cells with receptive fields at the focus of attention and suppressed the responses of cells with receptive fields outside the focus.</s><s>We measured the difficulty ratio [(H -E)/(H + E)] of the responses from the attentionmodulated cells at two spatial locations of attention (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>When spatial attention was inside the receptive field, most difficulty ratios were positive (30 out of 39, P = 0.0008, Chi-square test) indicating that V1 neurons responded more strongly during the hard task than the easy task (response enhancement).</s><s>In contrast, when spatial attention was located outside the receptive field, most difficulty ratios were negative (28 out of 39, P = 0.006, Chi-square test) indicating that V1 neurons responded less strongly during the hard task than the easy task (response suppression).</s><s>The magnitudes of the response enhancement and response suppression were significantly correlated to each other (r = 0.56, P &lt; 0.001, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>That is, neurons that showed the strongest response suppression when spatial attention was outside the receptive field showed the weakest response enhancement when spatial attention was inside the receptive field.</s><s>Conversely, neurons that showed the strongest response enhancement when attention was inside the receptive field showed no response suppression when attention was outside the receptive field.</s><s>This suggests that the response suppression and response enhancement driven by an increase in task difficulty could be mediated by different populations of neurons.</s><s>We investigated this idea further by performing a detailed study of the functional properties of neurons modulated by attention.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional properties of V1 neurons</head><p><s>Intrigued by the differences in the response properties of cell_a and cell_b, we divided our population of attentionally modulated cells into two groups: difficulty-enhanced and difficultysuppressed neurons.</s><s>We called difficulty-enhanced neurons those cells that showed a net enhancement in visual response with task difficulty, such as cell_a (n = 20) and difficultysuppressed neurons those that showed a net suppression of visual responses, such as cell_b (n = 19).</s><s>By definition, difficulty-enhanced neurons generate the strongest visual responses when the task is hard (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, left) and difficulty-suppressed neurons generate the strongest visual responses when the task is easy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">left</ref>).</s><s>We noticed that difficulty-enhanced neurons, such as cell_a, were usually non-directional selective, had narrow spike-widths and broad interspike interval distributions, as illustrated by four cell examples in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> (middle and right).</s><s>In contrast, difficulty-suppressed neurons, such as cell_b, were directional selective, had broader spike-widths and tighter interspike interval distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>, middle and right).</s></p><p><s>To quantify the relation between task-difficulty modulations and neuronal functional properties, we calculated a summed difficulty ratio for each cell as (Hs -Es)/(Hs +Es), where Hs = IH + OH and Es = IE + OE.</s><s>A positive ratio indicates that the cell responded more strongly during the hard task than the easy task (independently of the location of attention) and a negative ratio indicates that the cell responded more strongly during the easy task.</s><s>Consistent with the examples shown above, the summed difficulty ratio was correlated with the cell direction selectivity both in the sample of cells modulated by spatial attention (r = -0.58,</s><s>P &lt; 0.001, n = 39, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>) and in the entire sample (r = -0.25,</s><s>P &lt; 0.02, n = 92, not shown).</s><s>Moreover, the summed difficulty ratio was correlated with the cell's spike width (r = -0.58,</s><s>P &lt; 0.001, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>), and the peak of the interspike-interval distribution (r = 0.45, P &lt; 0.004, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>We also found a correlation between the summed difficulty ratio and contrast sensitivity (r = 0.51, P &lt;0.03) although the sample of cells tested for contrast was smaller (n = 19; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the regression lines from some of these correlations seemed to link two separate clusters of cells rather than a continuum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To estimate the significance of this observation, all the scatter plots from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> were tested for bimodality 31 (Hartigan tests were run in histograms with X-axes parallel to the regression lines).</s><s>These tests revealed a significant bimodal distribution in the projection defined by direction selectivity and the summed-difficulty-ratio (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>, P = 0.018), supporting the notion that difficulty-enhanced and difficulty-suppressed neurons form two separate clusters.</s><s>Interestingly, neurons whose responses were not modulated by spatial attention had intermediate properties between these two clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Other response properties were also compared between clusters but were not significantly different.</s><s>These included mean firing rate, response linearity (F1/F0 ratio), color sensitivity, spatial frequency tuning (peak and bandwidth), orientation tuning (circular variance), receptive field size, response latency and visual responses to brief dark/light spots (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Ideally, the attentional modulations should be measured at multiple levels of task difficulty to quantify the correlation between task difficulty and response magnitude.</s><s>However, it was not technically possible to measure multiple levels of task difficulty and acquire detailed quantification of the response properties from each cell, due primarily to the amount of time that the animals were willing to work.</s><s>To address this limitation, in a group of cells (n = 59) we gave priority to the measurement of attentional modulations over response properties and studied three or more levels of difficulty at two spatial locations.</s><s>Within 22 attention-modulated cells in the group, seven of them were classified as difficulty-enhanced (summed difficulty ratio &gt; 0) and six as difficulty-suppressed (summed difficulty ratio &lt; 0).</s><s>We calculated separate correlation coefficients for difficulty-enhanced and difficulty-suppressed neurons by measuring the mean firing rate at three different levels of difficulty (hard, medium and easy) and then normalizing the mean firing rate after dividing by the maximum mean rate obtained under the three conditions.</s><s>Consistent with the results reported above, the mean firing rate of the difficulty-enhanced neurons was positively correlated with task difficulty only when the spatial attention was inside of the receptive field (attention inside the receptive field: r = 0.66, P &lt; 0.0001; attention outside the receptive field: r = 0.07, P = 0.69).</s><s>In contrast, the mean firing rate of the difficulty-suppressed neurons was correlated with attention difficulty only when attention was outside of the receptive field (attention inside the receptive field: r = 0.12, P = 0.55; attention outside the receptive field (r = -0.77,</s><s>P &lt; 0.0001; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our results demonstrate that task difficulty modulates the activity of single neurons within the primary visual cortex and that attentional gain can be enhanced by a factor of about 3 when task difficulty is increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>We show that the increase in V1 attentional gain is obtained through a center-surround mechanism that enhances visual responses at the focus of attention and suppresses visual responses outside the focus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>We also demonstrate that the amount of response enhancement and suppression are correlated across neurons: neurons that show the strongest suppression when attention is outside the receptive field show the weakest response enhancement when attention is inside the receptive field, and vice versa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finally, we show that response enhancements and suppressions are mediated by two distinct populations of neurons with different response properties (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The difficultysuppressed neurons are more directionally selective, have tighter interspike interval distributions, wider spikes and higher contrast sensitivity than the difficulty-enhanced neurons.</s><s>These two populations of neurons may work together to increase sensitivity at the focus of attention while suppressing distractions caused by peripheral transient movement 7 .</s><s>Also, there may be laminar differences corresponding to the two populations of neurons modulated by attention.</s><s>It is interesting to note that some functional properties of difficulty-suppressed neurons (i.e.</s><s>high directional selectivity and high contrast sensitivity) match the functional properties of V1 neurons projecting to area MT 33 .</s><s>This match is interesting because area MT is involved in detecting fast transient movement that could lead to shifts in the spatial focus of attention 34, 35 .</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential contribution of small eye movements</head><p><s>Although our results clearly demonstrate the existence of task-difficulty modulations in area V1, a potential contribution from small microsaccade movements to these modulations must be carefully evaluated.</s><s>Microsaccades increase the firing rate of V1 neurons during fixation 40, 41 , therefore, differences in microsaccade frequency could potentially generate different firing rates in the various conditions tested here.</s></p><p><s>There are several reasons why microsaccades are unlikely to affect our measurements.</s><s>First, microsaccade frequency was not significantly different between the easy and hard task (0.40 ± 0.02 Hz versus 0.45 ± 0.02 Hz, P = 0.087, Wilcoxon test).</s><s>Second, the average eye position and fixation stability were similar across conditions and were not correlated with either the location of attention or the task difficulty (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Third, our results could be replicated when we selected trials without microsaccades (see methods).</s><s>And finally, it would be difficult to explain how a small change in microsaccade frequency or eye position could generate the correlations reported here between the magnitude of the visual response and the cell's response properties (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>For the eye movements to generate these correlations, the monkeys would have to be aware of the direction selectivity of the cell recorded and the location of the neuronal receptive field and use this information to generate patterns of eye movements that consistently suppressed the response of directional cells only when paying attention outside of the receptive field.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selective spatial attention during the easy task</head><p><s>It is important to emphasize that the monkeys had to attend selectively even when performing the easy task.</s><s>For example, if the color change was very noticeable, the monkeys could detect it as a bottom-up pre-attentional 'pop-out' effect instead of as a result of top-down selective spatial attention.</s><s>This scenario is unlikely for several reasons.</s><s>First, the color change was subtle (see methods) and monkeys reacted significantly faster when the spatial location of the change was cued at the beginning of the trial (see methods for detail).</s><s>Second, at the end of most trials the monkeys made saccades aimed at the cued spatial location, indicating that they were paying attention to this region of visual space (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Third, we found strong spatiallyselective correlations between the level of task difficulty and the magnitude of the visual response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>; since these correlations required the use of at least three levels of difficulty, it is clear that the monkeys used spatial attention to perform tasks that differed in difficulty).</s><s>Fourth, a main result from this study (the correlation between difficulty-modulations and direction selectivity) could be replicated in a foveal task, in which the monkey must pay attention always, independently of task difficulty (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> for details).</s></p><p><s>Finally, the task was designed to highly reward increased effort: the faster the detection the larger the reward.</s><s>Since monkeys are primarily motivated to perform for the reward, it is unlikely that they would increase the attentional effort during the hard task and at the same time failed to pay attention during the easy task, which is when they could best hope to achieve maximal reward.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuronal circuitry of visual attention</head><p><s>Our results suggest that the neuronal network of visual spatial attention involves not only specific brain areas 8, 12, 21 but also specific neuronal populations within each area.</s><s>It is interesting to speculate that the attention-enhanced neurons with short-duration spikes may have been fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons.</s><s>This conclusion is consistent with a recent study in area V4 that found strong attentional modulations in neurons with different spike widths 29 (the distribution of spike widths in our sample of V1 neurons shares certain resemblance with the distribution reported by Mitchell et al. in area V4, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The finding that task difficulty can enhance or suppress visual responses within area V1 has important implications for current models of spatial attention.</s><s>Whereas response enhancement could be explained by a spotlight that 'increases in intensity' with attentional load, the response suppression is better explained by models that emphasize the role of response-suppression and center-surround interactions in spatial attention 8, 10, 22, 24, 42-47 .</s><s>Most mathematical models of visual attention assume that response suppression is mediated by intracortical inhibition 10, 44 .</s><s>Our results support these models by showing that neurons with the thinnest spikes (putative inhibitory neurons) enhanced their visual responses with increased taskdifficulty, whereas neurons with the broadest spikes (unlikely to be inhibitory neurons) suppressed their responses (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with these models 10, 44 , our results also indicate that the strongest inhibition should be found inside the focus of attention since the difficulty-enhanced neurons increased their responses more strongly when the focus of attention was inside the receptive field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>It is important to note, however, that not all inhibitory populations have short-duration spikes and, conversely, that some cortical spiny neurons have very brief spikes 48 .</s></p><p><s>An important finding of this study is that difficulty-suppressed neurons are more directional selective and have tighter interspike interval-distributions (i.e. more transient responses) than difficulty-enhanced neurons.</s><s>Moreover, although neurons with the thinnest spikes are all difficulty-enhanced, neurons with broad spikes (presumably excitatory neurons) can be either difficulty-enhanced or difficulty-suppressed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Based on this finding, we would like to propose a conceptual model for the V1 neuronal circuitry involved in visual attention (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>According to this model, an increase in attentional load has two different effects on V1 neuronal responses.</s><s>First, it increases the visual responses of nondirectional/sustained neurons at the focus of attention to improve detection.</s><s>Second, it reduces the neuronal responses of directional/transient cells outside the focus of attention to suppress distraction.</s><s>We speculate that neurons with enhanced responses are part of a neuronal network involved in making detection more reliable at the focus of attention.</s><s>And neurons with suppressed responses are part of a neuronal network involved in detecting transient movement in the visual periphery, which needs to be suppressed to avoid attentional shifts during difficult detection tasks.</s><s>As part of this conceptual model, we predict that, unlike V4 cells 16, 17 , most V1 neurons projecting to area MT (and perhaps most MT neurons) should be difficultysuppressed.</s></p><p><s>Taken together with results from previous studies 16, 17 , our findings suggest that the mechanisms driving task difficulty modulations of neuronal responses are likely to be similar in both early and late cortical stages of visual processing.</s><s>Moreover, our study provides further evidence that area V1 plays an important role in the neural network of visual attention 11, 22-24, 49, 50 .</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis and statistical analysis</head><p><s>The effects of spatial attention and task difficulty on visual responses were quantified as follows.</s><s>First, we calculated the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) of the visual response preceding the color change (500 ms time window, bin = 10 ms;
