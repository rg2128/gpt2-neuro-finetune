<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>In a first series of experiments, we compared responses elicited by acoustic stimuli in the auditory cortex when the animal was passive to those elicited when it was engaged.</s><s>In a second series of experiments, we examined responses in the auditory cortex elicited by auditory stimuli during an intermodal (auditory-olfactory) selective attention task.</s><s>In a third series of experiments, we compared responses during sleep and under anesthesia.</s><s>In a fourth set of experiments, we compared cortical responses in the passive vs. the engaged condition in a modified version of the task in which the subject did not initiate trials.</s><s>Finally, we compared passive and engaged responses in the auditory thalamus.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Responses are suppressed in the engaged condition</head><p><s>We trained adult male Long Evans rats to perform a two-alternative choice auditory discrimination task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> .</s><s>The animal initiated a trial by inserting its nose into the center port of a three port operant chamber (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and Methods: Task 1).</s><s>After a waiting period (~ 2 seconds), a "target" sound was presented from either the right or the left side of the box, indicating which goal port (right or left) would be rewarded with water.</s><s>The target stimulus consisted of a 300 msec broadband stimulus presented monoaurally from either the right or the left speaker.</s><s>Later in the training phase, we introduced "non-target" stimuli during the waiting period, allowing us to probe the response to the non-target stimulus without retraining the animal on a new target.</s><s>The non-target stimulus consisted of a train of clicks (5 msec white noise bursts; repetition rate from 2-35 Hz, a range over which cortical responses show strong modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> ) presented diotically for 1.8 seconds, beginning after a variable (400-600 msec) period following trial initiation.</s><s>The onset of the non-target stimulus was randomized with respect to the nose poke, so the animal could not predict the stimulus onset precisely.</s><s>After animals reached criterion performance (&gt; 95% correct; ~1 week), we implanted movable tetrodes in the left primary auditory cortex (area A1) to record neural activity, including single unit responses, multi-unit responses and local field potentials (LFPs).</s><s>We also implanted earphones to ensure delivery of a controlled auditory stimulus to the unrestrained animal, regardless of its position in the box.</s></p><p><s>We first compared sound-evoked neural activity when the animal was engaged in the task with activity elicited by the same stimulus when the animal was passive but not asleep (see SM1: Behavioral monitoring and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>: Video analysis of movement).</s><s>Because the sounds were delivered through headphones, differences in neural activity in this paradigm must be due to differences in the animal's behavior or state, rather than to differences in the stimulus itself arising from uncontrolled changes in the sound path from speaker to the ear.</s></p><p><s>We expected that engagement in an auditory task would, like selective attention, lead to an enhancement of stimulus-evoked responses in the auditory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> .</s><s>Surprisingly, we found just the opposite: in the engaged condition, neural responses to all components of the stimulus -both target and non-target -were consistently suppressed.</s></p><p><s>We first analyzed the responses elicited by the first non-target stimulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-d</ref>).</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> shows suppression of the sound-evoked response in a well-isolated single unit.</s><s>Suppression of the evoked response was observed for most of the responsive (SM2: Stimulus response analysis) single units (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>, p&lt;0.01).</s><s>Suppression was also observed for measures of neural population activity, including multiunit activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>, p&lt;1e-16) and evoked LFP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>, p&lt;1e-16).</s><s>We quantified these effects across the population with a modulation index, defined as: (Activity engaged -Activity passive )/(Activity engaged + Activity passive ).</s><s>The modulation index ranges from -1 (complete suppression in the engaged condition) to +1 (complete suppression in the passive condition).</s><s>The modulation index was significantly negative for all three physiological measures of the evoked response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h-j</ref>), indicating that engaging in an auditory task reduced the number of spikes used for stimulus representation.</s><s>This suppression of evoked responses was not accompanied by any change in the spontaneous activity preceding stimulus presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-c</ref>,e-f,h-i), in contrast to other studies reporting an increase in spontaneous activity with task engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> .</s><s>There was no change (p&gt;0.2) in neural activity between the first and second passive block of trials (i.e. between the passive block before and after the engaged block), indicating that suppression was not due to nonstationarities in the recording, satiety, reward expectation, arousal, etc. (see SM4: Comparison of neural activity between first and second passive block).</s></p><p><s>Although most single units showed a suppression of evoked activity in the engaged condition, a minority showed an increase (8/32 units).</s><s>This had the effect of concentrating the stimulus-evoked spikes into smaller population of neurons, each with a relatively higher firing rate.</s><s>This concentration of activity has been quantified in terms of the kurtosis, which is a measure of the sparseness of a neural representation.</s><s>The kurtosis of the firing rate distribution in the engaged condition was greater than in the passive condition (kurtosis engaged = 8.4 ± 2.4 vs. kurtosis passive = 4.1 ± 0.7; p &lt;0.05; see SM5: Kurtosis of firing rate distribution), indicating that the stimulus representation in the engaged condition was sparser.</s></p><p><s>We next analyzed the responses to the remaining non-target stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>As has been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> , responses to the click train diminished as a function of repetition rate.</s><s>However, at all but the highest repetition rates, the responses in the engaged condition were relatively suppressed relative to the passive condition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Thus suppression interacts with repetition rate, but is not limited to the initial stimulus.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we analyzed the response to the target stimulus.</s><s>The train of non-target (diotic) stimuli preceding the target provided no information about the location of the reward, and was therefore irrelevant to the performance of the task; only the final (monaural) target stimulus was relevant and required the animal to attend to it.</s><s>This raised the possibility that the previous results could be explained by a model in which the animal selectively withdraws its attention prior to the onset of the target stimulus.</s><s>According to this hypothesis, suppression would be limited to the non-target stimuli, and the response to the relevant target stimulus would be enhanced.</s><s>However, the response to the target stimulus was not enhanced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>; see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2a-b</ref>: Single unit responses to task relevant and task irrelevant stimuli are equally suppressed during the task).</s><s>Rather, the suppression of the responses to the target stimulus was indistinguishable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>-e and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2c</ref>: Single unit responses to task relevant and task irrelevant stimuli are equally suppressed during the task) from that of the last non-target stimulus in the stimulus train (paired t-test, p&gt;0.1).</s><s>The absence of response enhancement to the target stimulus is consistent with the modest attentional load in this task; had the attentional load been greater, the suppression might have been attenuated or even converted into enhancement (assuming that attentional mechanisms are distinct and additive).</s><s>The equal suppression associated with target and non-target stimuli, and the lack of correlation between suppression and target selectivity, suggests that engagement induces a widespread suppression of evoked activity upon which any selective attentional effect is superimposed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intermodal auditory attention does not suppress responses in auditory cortex</head><p><s>Comparing the passive and engaged conditions revealed that sound-evoked responses were suppressed when the animal was engaged in an auditory task relative to those evoked when it was not performing the task.</s><s>However, it was unclear from this comparison what the key difference between the two behavioral conditions was.</s><s>One possibility was that, as suggested above, the key difference was whether the animal was engaged or passive; according to this hypothesis, suppression resulted simply from engaging in the task, regardless of the modality of the task.</s><s>Alternatively, the suppression might result specifically from the engagement of the auditory cortex in this auditory task.</s><s>Although this hypothesis would seem to contradict the intuitive expectation that engaging should increase rather than decrease neural activity, it is compatible with the data presented thus far, and makes a clear prediction: suppression in auditory cortex should not be observed if the animal were engaged but attending to a stimulus from a different sensory modality.</s></p><p><s>To distinguish these possibilities, we trained an additional group of five rats on an intermodal attention task <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> in which we could compare sound-evoked responses elicited in auditory cortex when the animal was engaged in an auditory task with responses elicited by the same sounds when the animal was engaged in a non-auditory (olfactory) task (see Methods: Task 2).</s><s>An auditory stimulus and an olfactory stimulus were presented simultaneously on every trial.</s><s>To increase the difficulty of the task and thereby increase the likelihood of detecting an effect of selective attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> , we used a tone discrimination task which was substantially more challenging (~3 weeks training, performance ~ 80%) than the spatial discrimination task (~1 week training, performance &gt;95%) presented above.</s><s>Trials were grouped into olfactory and auditory blocks (~50-70 trials each) in which the rat was rewarded for basing its decision on either the olfactory or the auditory stimulus, respectively.</s><s>We reasoned that if the suppression observed in the engaged condition were specific to engaging in an auditory task, then responses in the auditory block would be suppressed relative to the olfactory block, whereas if suppression were not specific to the auditory nature of the task no difference would be observed between the two conditions.</s><s>In these experiments, we defined the modulation index as: (Activity auditory block -Activity olfactory block )/(Activity auditory block + Activity olfactory block ).</s></p><p><s>There was no net suppression of sound-evoked responses elicited during the auditory block compared with those elicited during the olfactory block (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-b</ref>).</s><s>Spontaneous activity was also not affected.</s><s>Indeed, there was a slight, albeit nonsignificant, trend toward enhancement in the auditory block, as expected from recordings in an auditory area during an auditory task.</s><s>A subset of single neurons showed strong modulation (either positive or negative) between the auditory and olfactory blocks, so that the very small net change between the blocks reflected a balance between the changes in the two conditions (not shown; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> ).</s><s>These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that engaging in an auditory task per se suppresses responses in auditory cortex, and support the interpretation advanced above that suppression results from engaging in a task, regardless of sensory modality.</s></p><p><s>As a further test, we compared responses in all three conditions (passive, engaged-auditory, engaged-olfactory) in a single animal performing another intermodal attention task (see Methods: Task 3).</s><s>As expected, sound-evoked responses were suppressed in both the auditory and the olfactory blocks compared with the passive block, and responses during the auditory block were not suppressed relative to the responses during the olfactory block (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c-d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, engaging in an auditory task did not elicit a reduction in acoustically-evoked responses relative to engaging in an olfactory task, in marked contrast to the robust suppression of acoustically-evoked responses relative to the passive condition.</s><s>We therefore conclude that the general suppression observed in the purely auditory task did not depend on the auditory nature of the task.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suppression is independent of receptive field properties</head><p><s>In the visual cortex, attention can suppress responses in neurons that are not tuned to the attended feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s><s>Because in our experiments we recorded from several neurons simultaneously, we could not optimize the stimulus properties to match the receptive field properties of the recorded neurons.</s><s>This raised the possibility that the suppression we observed in the engaged condition was due to attentional suppression in the majority of neurons which were stimulated suboptimally.</s></p><p><s>To test this hypothesis, we recorded tuning curves and assessed the relationship between the receptive field and the modulation index of the evoked responses.</s><s>We expected that if suppression arose from the presentation of suboptimal stimuli, then the modulation index should increase with stimulus selectivity or with the degree to which the best frequency matched the attended frequency.</s><s>However, there was no correlation between the modulation index and spatial selectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2d</ref>: Single unit responses to task relevant and task irrelevant stimuli are equally suppressed during the task), frequency selectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>), or the distance in octaves between the best frequency and the attended frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>: Measurement of cortical tuning curves).</s><s>Interestingly, suppression was correlated with spontaneous activity, a property of the cells that does not depend on the stimulus used during the task (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>: Cortical units with high spontaneous firing rates show less suppression of the evoked response during the task).</s><s>Thus in summary, taskengaged suppression cannot be readily predicted from receptive field properties.</s></p></div>
