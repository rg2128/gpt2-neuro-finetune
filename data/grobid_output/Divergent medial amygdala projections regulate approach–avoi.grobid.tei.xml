<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Animals across all levels of complexity possess approach mechanisms that evoke social and exploratory behavior, and avoidance behaviors that evoke withdrawal and flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>In order to maximize gains, animals will engage in risky exploratory behavior, ignoring signs of potential threat, to exploit resources in their environment.</s><s>Animals exposed to competing environmental cues must negotiate between mutually incompatible behaviors, such as feeding, reproduction, flight or defense.</s><s>In some contexts, threatening stimuli, such as predators or aggressive conspecifics, will suppress appetitive behavior, such as reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Conversely, hunger and food seeking will override defensive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Defensive responses can be adaptive depending on the fed state of an animal and evidence suggests that these adaptations specifically involve neurons in sub-regions of the medial amygdala (MeA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>Thus, animals require integrated circuits to generate gradients of defensive responses appropriate to the contextual threat, and approach responses proportional to potential gains.</s><s>A major conflicting drive of innate avoidance is an inherent motivation to approach and explore the unknown.</s><s>In the classical sense of approachavoidance conflict, exploratory drive is an essential feature of maximizing an animal's ability to thrive, whereas avoidance is essential for survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Early lesion and electrical stimulation studies have provided intriguing insight into potential loci of approach-avoidance interactions.</s><s>In rats, electrolytic lesion of the corticomedial amygdala, which encompassed the MeA, elicited a reduction in freezing behavior and an increase in exploratory interactions with a live cat, a natural predator of the rat <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, more restricted excitotoxic lesion of the MeA greatly reduces defensive behavior in rats during exposure to a live cat and increases exploratory locomotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>These finding supports the idea that innate approach of the unfamiliar cat is actively suppressed by the innate avoidance impulse.</s><s>In contrast to lesions, electrical stimulation of subcortical brain regions can elicit either approach, avoidance, or in some cases ambivalent responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Intriguingly, the regions that produced these ambivalent responses are innervated by the MeA, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH).</s></p><p><s>In addition to lesion studies, activity mapping using the immediate-early gene Fos has strongly implicated the MeApv in the processing of innate threat cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Retrograde tracing and Fos expression analysis revealed that MeApv neurons that were activated by threat stimuli projected to hypothalamic nuclei are implicated in both appetitive (reproduction) and aversive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, MeApv neurons activated by reproductive stimuli did not project to these regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that the MeA-hypothalamic pathway may be an important "gate" between conflicting appetitive behavior and threatening stimuli, either through interneurons within the VMH or through indirect modulation by the BNST <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We recently identified the MeA as a brain region activated in response to stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>The midbrain dopamine system plays an essential role in reward learning, motivation, fear learning and avoidance of conditioned stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Recent data support a role for dopamine in modulating approach-avoidance conflict.</s><s>Increasing dopamine activity by lesioning an inhibitory input onto dopamine neurons in the VTA causes animals to display increased approach to a predator odor threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, increasing dopamine with the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors is an effective treatment for specific phobias <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , disorders likely caused by dysfunction in innate fear circuitry <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The MeA is considered part of the caudal striatum, or more generally a component of the striatopallidal complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>This anatomical association suggests that the MeA may be functionally involved in dopamine-dependent behaviors.</s><s>Given the role of the MeA in regulating innate defensive responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , along with the observation that dopamine neurons of the midbrain are connected to this striatopallidal-like structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , we hypothesized that dopamine receptive neurons in this region would likely contribute to innate approach and avoidance behavior.</s><s>We identified dopamine receptive neurons in the MeA that express D1R and are strongly biased in their localization to the MeApv.</s><s>Using viral tracing methods, calcium imaging, and optogenetic/pharmacological manipulations, we find that MeApv D1R neurons segregate into distinct populations that regulate either approach or avoidance of innate threat stimuli.</s><s>These populations regulate approach and avoidance behaviors through two separate projections, one largely inhibitory projection to the BNST, and one largely excitatory projection to the dorsomedial VMH (VMHdm)</s></p></div>

some clear distinctions.</s><s>Like the striatum, the MeA contains dopamine-receptive neurons and appears to possess a type of direct and indirect pathway.</s><s>First, MeApv-D1R neurons send a direct excitatory projection to the VMHdm to regulate innate defensive behaviors.</s><s>Second, MeApv-D1R neurons send an inhibitory projection to the BNST which may serve as an indirect pathway.</s><s>Consistent with previous anatomical analysis of MeApv projections, MeApv neurons preferentially innervate the BNSTtr and to a lesser extent the BNSTif, both of which project to the defensive nuclei in the hypothalamus; notably the BNSTif projects to the VMHdm <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>The manner in which GABAergic projections from the MeApv-D1R neurons to the BNST suppress defensive behavior remains unclear.</s><s>One possibility is that these projections would inhibit intra-BNST GABAergic interneurons to disinhibit GABAergic outputs to the

not been established.</s><s>Here we demonstrate a role for dopamine in innate fear behavior through the modulation of dopamine D1R signaling in the MeApv.</s><s>Specifically, we show that increasing D1R signaling onto MeApv-D1R neurons increases approach behavior, likely through the simultaneous suppression of the VMH pathway and activation of the BNST pathway.</s><s>This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that a significant fraction of dopamine neurons are inhibited by aversive stimuli and activated by appetitive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Under these conditions dopamine levels would be low during threat encounters and high during increased incentive motivation.</s><s>Thus, when an animal is threatened, reduced dopamine would promote the activation of the VMH avoidance pathway, and under increased appetitive motivational states elevated dopamine levels would promote activation of approach pathways and suppression of avoidance pathways.</s><s>Interestingly, it has recently been shown that activation of distinct inhibitory subpopulations within the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) oppositely regulate olfactory cue-induced freezing to an innate threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>Given that the LDT is a potent regulator of the midbrain dopamine system this represents a putative mechanism

(k-i) Proposed model for how competing incentive states modulate VMH versus BNST MEA PV -D1R pathways depending on dopamine levels in the amygdala. Under low competing incentive states when dopamine levels are low the MEApv-D1R→ VMH pathway predominates to mediate avoidance. Under high competing incentive states when dopamine levels are increased the MEApv-D1R→BNST predominates to mediate approach in the face of danger. Unless otherwise indicated, Tukey&apos;s multiple comparisons test used for a 1-way ANOVA and Bonferonni&apos;s multiple comparison&apos;s test was used for 2-way ANOVA.
