<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor RNAs is responsible for greatly expanding the regulatory and functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes.</s><s>Of the different classes of AS, intron retention (IR) is the least well understood.</s><s>In plants and unicellular eukaryotes, IR is the most common form of AS, whereas in animals, it is thought to represent the least prevalent form.</s><s>Using high-coverage poly(A) + RNA-seq data, we observe that IR is surprisingly frequent in mammals, affecting transcripts from as many as three-quarters of multiexonic genes.</s><s>A highly correlated set of cis features comprising an ''IR code'' reliably discriminates retained from constitutively spliced introns.</s><s>We show that IR acts widely to reduce the levels of transcripts that are less or not required for the physiology of the cell or tissue type in which they are detected.</s><s>This ''transcriptome tuning'' function of IR acts through both nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and nuclear sequestration and turnover of IR transcripts.</s><s>We further show that IR is linked to a cross-talk mechanism involving localized stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and reduced availability of spliceosomal components.</s><s>Collectively, the results implicate a global checkpoint-type mechanism whereby reduced recruitment of splicing components coupled to Pol II pausing underlies widespread IR-mediated suppression of inappropriately expressed transcripts.</s></p><p><s>[Supplemental material is available for this article.]</s></p><p><s>Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread process by which splice sites in primary transcripts are differentially utilized to produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pan et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wang et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nilsen and Graveley 2010)</ref>.</s><s>It is regulated by the complex interplay of cis-and trans-acting factors that serve to promote or repress the assembly of productive splicing complexes, referred to as spliceosomes.</s><s>Alternative ''cassette'' exon splicing is thought to represent the most frequent type of AS in animals and has been implicated in the control of diverse aspects of normal and disease biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kalsotra and Cooper 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Irimia and Blencowe 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, intron retention (IR), the process by which specific introns remain unspliced in polyadenylated transcripts, is thought to represent the least prevalent form of AS in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Galante et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sakabe and de Souza 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wang et al. 2008)</ref>, whereas it is the most frequent form in plants, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes <ref type="bibr"

shown that IR functions in the homeostatic control of the expression of some RNA processing and export factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kalyna et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr"

controls the expression of developmentally regulated genes in plants and animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kalyna et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yap et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wong et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>For example, a set of retained introns in a murine neuroblastoma cell line was shown to negatively regulate genes with neural-associated functions.</s><s>Several of these introns were linked to nuclear retention and exosome-mediated RNA turnover of the host transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yap et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, another set of IR events was found to control the levels of transcripts important for granulocyte maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wong et al. 2013)</ref>, largely through the process of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).</s><s>These recent studies suggest that different IR events control gene expression through distinct mechanisms.</s><s>However, the extent to which IR operates across different primary cells and tissues to regulate gene expression via these and possibly additional mechanisms is not known.</s></p><p><s>By applying a new pipeline for IR detection to high coverage poly(A) + RNA-seq data from more than 40 diverse human and mouse cell and tissue types, we have performed the most comprehensive analysis of IR to date in mammals.</s><s>We find that IR is far more frequent in mammals than previously appreciated, affecting transcripts from most genes.</s><s>A set of distinct cis features reliably discriminates this greatly expanded set of retained introns from introns that undergo constitutive splicing.</s><s>These retained introns comprise three main classes with distinct evolutionary origins.</s><s>We further provide evidence that retained introns act widely to functionally ''tune'' transcriptomes by further reducing the expression of relatively low abundance transcripts that often lack physiological relevance to the cells and tissues they are detected in.</s><s>Finally, we show that IR is tightly linked to the increased occupancy of RNA Pol II over the corresponding intronic sequence at the genomic level and to reduced levels of core splicing factors.</s><s>Our results thus suggest that bidirectional cross-talk between Pol II and IR as a consequence of reduced splicing factor recruitment is an important and widespread mechanism that contributes to the functional tuning of mammalian cell and tissue transcriptomes.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High prevalence of intron retention in mammalian transcriptomes</head><p><s>To systematically detect IR in mammals, we discriminated retained from constitutively spliced introns using alignments of reads from poly(A) + RNA-seq data from ;40 cell and tissue types from human and mouse (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>Reads were aligned to a comprehensive set of reference sequences comprising exon-intron junctions, intron midpoint sequences, and exon-exon junctions formed by intron removal.</s><s>The degree of IR was represented using the metric percent intron retention (PIR), the percentage of transcripts in which a given intron is retained.</s><s>In brief, PIR was calculated as the percentage of the average number of reads mapping to the 59 and 39 exon-intron junctions, over the sum of the average of the exon-intron junction reads plus the exon-exon junction reads.</s><s>Additionally, we required a balanced accumulation of reads mapping to 59 and 39 exon-intron junctions and to intron midpoint sequences (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>These and additional steps were also used to distinguish IR from alternative transcription initiation/ termination, alternative 59/39 splice-site selection, and/or overlap with transcripts from other genes including antisense loci (see Methods).</s><s>IR was detected to variable extents between different cell and tissue types.</s><s>In general, a higher proportion of introns were found to be retained in neural and immune cell types, whereas IR was detected less often in ES and muscle cells (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>; see below).</s><s>These differences in IR frequency are unlikely due to differences in read coverage, since the majority of analyzed RNA-seq data sets had a comparable degree of read depth (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>RT-PCR validation experiments on 25 representative examples of IR detected by our analysis pipeline, using cell and tissue RNA samples from independent sources from those used to generate the RNA-seq data, confirmed the presence of IR in all cases (Methods; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, measurements of cell/tissue-differential PIR by RNA-seq correlated well with corresponding measurements of PIR by RT-PCR (r = 0.63, P &lt; 2.2 3 10 À16 , Pearson correlation) (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To estimate the total proportions of human and mouse introns that may be subjected to retention, we determined the frequency of IR detection after randomly sampling increasing numbers of cell and tissue RNA-seq data sets.</s><s>Remarkably, ;53% and 51% of all human and mouse introns, respectively, have the potential to be retained in poly(A) + transcripts at a PIR $ 10 in at least one of the cell or tissue types, and ;9% and 8% have the potential to be retained at a PIR $ 50 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S1C</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, ;77% of human and mouse multiexonic genes contain one or more retained introns with a PIR $ 10, and 35% contain one or more retained introns with a PIR $ 50% (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S1D</ref>).</s><s>These results reveal that the frequency of IR compares with the frequency of cassette exon AS <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pan et al. 2008)</ref> and is far more prevalent in mammalian cells and tissues than previously detected using lower coverage RNA-seq data <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wang et al. 2008)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distinguishing features and classes of retained introns</head><p><s>Consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Galante et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sakabe and de Souza 2007)</ref>, retained introns are on average shorter, more C/G rich, and associated with weaker splice sites than are constitutive introns (all tests P &lt; 0.001, one-sided Mann-Whitney U test) (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S3</ref>).</s><s>We used logistic regression to determine whether these and additional cis features, or an ''IR code,'' can be used to reliably discriminate retained from constitutively spliced Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s><s>Detection and prevalence of intron retention.</s><s>(A) Intron retention was detected by aligning RNA-seq reads to comprehensive sets of exon-intron and exon-exon junctions.</s><s>Reads mapping to midintron sequences and balanced counts of reads aligning to upstream and downstream exon-intron sequences were used to discriminate IR from other forms of transcript variation.</s><s>IR levels were measured using percent intron retention (PIR): 1003 mean retention reads over the sum of retention and spliced intron reads (see Methods for details).</s><s>(B) Percentage of total human introns detected as retained at different PIR thresholds as increasing numbers of cell and tissue samples are randomly sampled.</s><s>Numbers in parentheses are estimates for percentages of total introns retained at different PIR thresholds, as derived from extrapolation.</s><s>(Circles) Means from 1,000 iterations;

data for mouse genes in Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">S1D</ref>.</s><s>(D) Cis-acting features predictive of IR in human.</s><s>The main graph quantifies, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, how well individual features or a logistic regression model comprising 136 features (''Complete IR code'') (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) distinguish retained (PIR $ 10) from constitutive (PIR &lt; 2) introns in neural tissues.</s><s>See Methods for details.</s><s>The graph on the upper right shows the receiver operating characteristic of the complete IR code with area under the curve (AUC) indicated.</s><s>(TPR) True positive rate;

1 3 10 À300 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>; Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>These results indicate that introns detected as retained in poly(A) + RNA by our pipeline are associated with a set of hallmark features that distinguishes them from general introns.</s></p><p><s>To further investigate cis features that define IR events, we considered that retained introns comprise three distinct types with different evolutionary origins, designated below as Types A-C (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>; see Methods).</s><s>Type A are ancestral introns flanked by constitutive exons, Type B arose by ''intronization'' of ancestral exonic sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Irimia et al. 2008)</ref>, and Type C are located adjacent to one or more alternative exons that may or may not be conserved between species.</s><s>Separating retained introns according to this classification reveals markedly different features.</s><s>Type A introns are the most frequent and, relative to Type B and C, have an intermediate C/G content and length, and are the most weakly retained (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">2B-D</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S4A-C</ref>).</s><s>Type B represent the smallest fraction of retained introns and, consistent with their intra-exonic location, have the highest C/G content, the shortest length, the weakest splice sites, and the highest PIR values (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">2B-D</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S4A-D</ref>).</s><s>Type C are intermediate in number, have the lowest C/G content, and are longer than Type A and B introns, which suggest a relatively recent evolution that may be tied to the flanking alternative exons (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">2B-D</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S4A-C</ref>).</s><s>Retained introns thus comprise a heterogeneous group harboring distinct features and PIR levels that likely reflect different evolutionary origins and functional properties.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evolutionary conservation of IR across vertebrate species</head><p><s>To gain insight into which cell and tissue differential IR events may have conserved functions, we next examined the extent to which IR events are conserved between the equivalent organs (whole brain, cerebellum, heart, muscle, liver, kidney, and testis) from up to 11 vertebrate species spanning ;440 million years of evolution (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3A</ref>).</s><s>Similar to cassette exon AS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barbosa-Morais et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Merkin et al. 2012)</ref>, IR has diverged rapidly in all tissues during vertebrate evolution, although to a considerably lesser extent in the brain than in organs such as testis, which shows the most divergent IR profiles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3A</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S5A</ref>).</s><s>Hierarchically clustering tissue samples by their transcriptomewide PIR profiles results in the segregation of most brain tissues from primate species, whereas other samples generally cluster according to species; testis is an exception due to its high heterogeneity of PIR patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3B</ref>, see legend).</s><s>Similar results were obtained using principal component analysis (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S5B</ref>).</s><s>These results thus suggest that IR, although having diverged rapidly in all analyzed vertebrate organs, more often provides conserved functions in the nervous system than in other tissues.</s></p></div>
