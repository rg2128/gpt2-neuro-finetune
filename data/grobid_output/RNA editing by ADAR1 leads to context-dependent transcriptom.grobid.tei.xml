type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , is the most widespread RNA-editing type in humans.</s><s>This modification is catalyzed by the ADAR (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) protein family.</s><s>Most editing events are mediated by ADAR1 (gene symbol-ADAR) with two distinct protein isoforms p110 and p150.</s><s>Doublestranded RNA (dsRNA), often formed between adjacent inverted repetitive (IR) elements, is the obligatory substrate of ADAR.</s><s>Thus, a large fraction of editing sites occurs in Alu retroelements, interspersed within non-coding regions of mRNA transcripts including introns and untranslated regions (UTRs).</s><s>The high abundance of the primate-specific Alu retroelements in the human genome, is a major cause of most of the RNA-editing activity in the human transcriptome <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>There are millions of editing sites in non-coding regions and although many are edited at only a tiny fraction of the transcripts, there are still thousands of sites where the editing level is significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , suggesting a functional role.</s></p><p><s>ADAR1 is required for normal fetal development.</s><s>Knocked out mice die at an early embryonic stage (day 11.5) with defects in hematopoiesis and liver disintegration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> apparently due to abnormal induction of a type-I interferon response.</s><s>In hematopoietic stem cells, loss of ADAR1 led to global up regulation of interferon-stimulated genes and apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>ADAR1 is also vital for post-natal hepatic development and homeostasis, with hepatocyte-specific depletion of ADAR1 leads to liver inflammation and necrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Likewise, ADAR1 is vital for B lineage development <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s></p><p><s>dsRNA is a major inducer of anti-viral type-I interferon response via activation of cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, bi-allelic mutations in ADAR1 were documented to cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, an inflammatory genetic syndrome associated with toxic perturbation of the type-I interferon response ("interferonopathy") <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Recent studies directly connect the severe phenotypes of ADAR1 deficiency to its mRNA editing activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>ADAR1 is assumed to prevent activation of relevant cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids (mainly MDA5) by RNA duplexes dispersed in the human transcriptome.</s></p><p><s>Editing may regulate RNA abundance and fate by changing the local structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>This may change the stability of the RNA duplex, affect structural determinants recognized by trans-acting factors and can change accessibility of factors to defined regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> .</s><s>As even a single-nucleotide variant may affect RNA structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> , RNA editing may well affect the transcriptome secondary structure landscape.</s><s>Furthermore, A-to-I editing events frequently occur in clusters (hyper-edited regions), and such regions may undergo major structural alterations.</s><s>Indeed, early pioneering studies demonstrated an unwinding activity for ADAR enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Despite the accumulating evidence regarding the regulation of transcript structures by ADAR1 and the role of this regulation in health and disease, no study investigated the structural changes induced by ADAR using an experimental global approach.</s></p><p><s>Recently, new methodologies were developed for experimental identification of RNA 2D structure in a transcriptome wide manner using next generation sequencing (NGS).</s><s>Some are based on probing with single-strand (SS) and double-strand (DS) specific nucleases <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Using such approaches, the global yeast, thale cress, fruit fly, nematode and human transcriptome 2D structures, were mapped <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> .</s><s>Methods that are based on chemical probing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , more suitable for in vivo studies, were also developed and applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Here, we report the use of high-throughput probing techniques to directly examine, the effect of ADAR1 deficiency and A-to-I editing on the whole transcriptome 2D structure and relate the data to the regulation of the cytosolic innate immune response.</s><s>We show that in human cells, hundreds of transcripts undergo ADAR1 editing-dependent structural changes.</s><s>In contrast to the prevailing paradigm that ADAR1 activity decreases RNA duplex stability, we find that A-to-I editing may increase the stability of RNA duplexes and that the effect on the global RNA structure is context dependent.</s><s>The smaller subset of genes whose transcripts are destabilized upon editing, as previously postulated, are significantly enriched for housekeeping genes and genes linked to the anti-viral interferon response.</s><s>These transcripts tend to be localized in the cytoplasm, and are relevant to the involvement of ADAR1 in dampening innate immune response.</s></p></div>
