(2013)</ref> interestingly were able to drive changes in anxiety levels to the extent that previously neutral or innocuous odorants became unpleasant and took longer to detect.</s><s>Using fMRI they were able to discern that these now aversive odorants induced augmented responses in higher olfactory cortices and the anterior cingulate cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Krusemark et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Our mouse studies utilized three different types of anxiety paradigms including MB, LDB and EPM.</s><s>MB and LDB tests examine basal level of anxiety in non-threatening environments, whereas the EPM introduces a threatening or actual danger of being 42 cm off the ground.</s><s>The MB task has been demonstrated to be an effective assessment of anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Borsini et al., 2002)</ref> but is also utilized to measure the degree of repetitive compulsivity or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), for example, when transgenic mice are devoid of producing serotonin <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Angoa-Pérez et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, supplementing with serotoninactive compounds or a variety of anxiolytics that act to reduce anxiety, depression, or OCD, will oppositely reduce burying or digging behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Borsini et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deacon, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Because Kv1.3-/-mice did not bury significantly greater number of marbles than that of WT mice, they do not appear to be a model for repetitive compulsivity, although the other two paradigms, LDB and EPM, indicated a significant difference in anxiety-like behaviors, and ones that could be ameliorated by MPH treatment.</s><s>The LDB can predict basal anxiolytic-or anxiogenic-like activity in mice, whereby transitions have been reported to be an index of activity-exploration over that of time spent in each compartment, which might habituate over time, but is a reflection of aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bourin and Hascoët, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>In LDB, mice with targeted deletion of Kv1.3 channel spent less time in the light chamber and had a greater latency to move to the light chamber, indicating anxiogenic behaviors.</s><s>The level of transitions between chambers trended to be less for female Kv1.3-/-mice that perhaps additionally had reduced activity-exploration behaviors.</s><s>In the EPM, Kv1.3-/-mice not only spent less time in the open arms, they transitioned to them less frequently and their total transitions between compartments were less independent of sex.</s><s>In comparison to treatments in which insulin is intranasally delivered to phosphorylate its Kv1.3 substrate, which is known to decrease mean open time of the channel <ref type="bibr">(Fadool et al., 2011)</ref>, mice with reduced Kv1.3 activity but not targeted deletion have anxiolytic-like behaviors or reduced anxiety in terms of more time in the light chamber of the LDB as well as increased time in open arms of the EPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Marks et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Even though posttranslational modification of the channel and targeted deletion both disrupt channel function, phosphorylation of Kv1.3 channel can serve as a signalplex for a variety of protein-protein interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cook and Fadool, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Marks and Fadool, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Colley et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Marks et al., 2009)</ref> and may not necessarily correlate to a complete absence of the ion channel protein.</s><s>Intranasal insulin would also not be expected to have phosphorylation effects on a single substrate.</s></p><p><s>Studies have begun to examine the effect of MPH on anxiety in control vs. disorder populations.</s><s>In our investigation of the ability for MPH to mitigate the anxiety behaviors noted in the Kv1.3-/-mice, the time spent in the light chamber of the LDB was significantly reduced in Kv1.3-/-mice and increased compared with that of WT animals following MPH administration.</s><s>The Kv1.3-/-mice had a delayed latency to enter the light chamber that was 4× as long as that exhibited by WT mice-which again was completely ameliorated following MPH administration to the short 10 s latency observed for that of WT mice.</s><s>One could alternatively interpret that the reduced latency to the dark in MPH treated Kv1.3-/-mice could be due to the delivery of a potent stimulant drug, rather than reduced anxiety, however, the MPH treated Kv1.3-/-mice spend equal amount of time in the light as WT mice, indicating this was not attributed to increased movement.</s><s>MPH had no effect on anxiety in the WT cohort.</s><s>Interestingly, in comparing our data to that of a human subjects study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Segev et al. (2016)</ref> also found that MPH was ineffective in reducing anxiety across a control group or elicited mild enhancement in anxiety, but significantly decreased anxiety in individuals with subclinical or state-anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Segev et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Golubchik et al.

2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ishisaka et al., 2012)</ref>, but provided an advantage in terms of the absence of training required to perform the task and the reduced amount of time involved in completing the task.</s><s>We have previously demonstrated that Kv1.3-/-mice exhibit no deficits in short-(1 h) or long-term (24 h) memory when examined in a simple object memory recognition test <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Tucker et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore the reduced performance of Kv1.3-/-mice in the object-based attention test that was ameliorated by MPH treatment was not likely attributed to any disruption in memory.</s><s>Although our object-based attention test had the limitation that it could not fully examine ADHD characteristics by utilizing typical multiple fixed-interval/extinction schedules of reinforcement (FI/Ext schedules) to allow sustained attentiveness, impulsivity, or hyperactivity to be measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sagvolden et al., 2005)</ref>, it could potentially be used for large-scale preclinical screening of drug candidates, for example.</s><s>An operant attention task (5-choice serial reaction time task; Asinof and Paine, 2014) is a more demanding task that could be examined for a refined exploration of the type of inattentiveness defect.</s></p><p><s>While young Kv1.3-/-mice trended to have a reduced recognition index compared to that of WT mice, older mice exhibited a significantly reduced index that was restored following MPH treatment.</s><s>It is likely that the attention deficit present in the Kv1.3-/-mice is not strongly age-dependent because the reduced attention deficit observed in the young animals is similarly restored following MPH treatment and may be the result of lesser sample size.</s><s>The fact that MPH treatment could ameliorate a reduced recognition index in both age groups implicates that Kv1.3-/-mice could be suitable models for inattentiveness or cognition problems.</s><s>The amount of MPH presented to each mouse was equivalent to the clinical dose given to human subjects diagnosed with ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balcioglu et al., 2009)</ref>; however, only a single dose was utilized for this study, while some studies have included several dosages for comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balcioglu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zhu et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>A stronger effect on the attention levels of either Kv1.3-/-or WT mice may have been observed with the use of a higher dose or with the use of repeated or chronic administration of MPH.</s></p><p><s>Our use of a metabolic chamber to measure locomotor activity was an indirect method to assess hyperactivity, nonetheless we found that the Kv1.3-/-mice did not have significantly elevated, sustained hyperactivity levels.</s><s>The type of rapid locomotor activity we observed by our animals was unexpected and a slower rate of lessened activity over time would be more anticipated.</s><s>Any handling effect would have been anticipated to be closer to the time of gavage rather than 30-60 min following.</s><s>Our administered dose of MPH may have elicited a rapid onset of locomotor activity, which was just not sustained.</s><s>Another interpretation based upon studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kuczenski and Segal (2005)</ref> is that ''clinical doses'' of MPH (∼0.5 mg/kg) are near or below threshold for the induction of locomotor activation, although they retain the ability to affect extracellular neurotransmitter release <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kuczenski and Segal, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Venkataraman et al., 2017.</ref></s><s>Thus our dose of 0.75 mg/kg was clinical but perhaps only marginally affected locomotor activity.</s><s>Interestingly, route of delivery is also a factor.</s><s>It is known that intraperitoneal administration of MPH causes a higher peak plasma drug level <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Patrick et al., 1984)</ref> vs. that of oral administration.</s><s>In fact, <ref type="bibr">Kuczenski and</ref><ref type="bibr">Segal (2001, 2002)</ref> found that lower doses of MPH (0.75-3.0 mg/kg) had increased locomotor activity when administered IP but not when provided orally.</s><s>Previous studies involving metabolic chamber testing have indicated that Kv1.3-/-mice had significantly greater locomotor activity than WT mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fadool et al., 2004)</ref>; whereas here we noted the same trend although it did not reach statistical significance.</s><s>Additionally, treating young mice with MPH resulted in increased locomotor activity, regardless of genotype.</s><s>Because MPH is a stimulant, its administration to normally functioning individuals typically results in increased activity levels while its administration to individuals with inattention typically results in reduced activity.</s><s>Both young WT and Kv1.3-/-mice exhibited a trend toward greater activity with MPH treatment.</s><s>Whereas possibly due to age factor, older mice lacked locomotor response to MPH treatment.</s><s>Overall, these results indicate that Kv1.3-/mice are not a suitable model of hyperactivity.</s></p><p><s>Stimulants exert their effectiveness by acting on both the dopaminergic (DA) and norepinephrine systems in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Biederman and Faraone, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hellwig-Brida et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Neurodegenerative diseases that have a similar loss of DA, such as Parkinson's Disease, are also associated with a change in olfactory sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mesholam et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore focused our protein biochemistry analysis on DA and its downstream metabolites.</s><s>MPH, in particular, is a DA transporter (DAT) inhibitor, thus resulting in an increase in extracellular DA concentrations through the release of DA from intracellular storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carey et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Biederman and Faraone, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>While we did not explore direct MPH induction of DA, others have found it to increase DA release from the PFC, nucleus acumens and caudate-putamen <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carey et al., 1998)</ref> and also found that it increases frontal cortex and striatal activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hellwig-Brida et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Stress can increase DA release in the PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Deutch and Roth, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Finlay et al., 1995)</ref> and elevated D2DR availability in the orbitofrontal cortex has been linked in humans with social anxiety disorder symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Plavén-Sigray et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We found that Kv1.3-/-mice have an elevated, basal level of DA in the OB and a reduction in one of its metabolites, DOPAC.</s><s>While we don't know its comparative level in the PFC, the level of TH, ERK and D2DR were all unchanged in the PFC, suggesting that dopaminergic signaling in this region is likely not responsible for anxiety-like behaviors of the Kv1.3-/mice.</s><s>While vesicular release of DA is typically cleared by DAT in most brain regions, the OB predominantly uses catechol-Omethyl-transferase (COMT) over that of <ref type="bibr">DAT (el-Etri et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cockerham et al., 2016)</ref>, so it is not inconceivable that MPH would have no real targeted effect in the OB.</s><s>The fact that DA is elevated in the OB of Kv1.3-/-mice, however, might suggest a differential degree of dopaminergic modulation in the Kv1.3-/-mice, leading to a change in olfactory sensitivity.</s><s>For example, olfactory gain control driven by local juxtaglomerular interneurons via traditional lateral inhibition is regulated by co-release of DA and GABA from deep short axon cells to change firing frequency of the major output neurons, namely mitral/tufted cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Vaaga et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In order for an animal model to be similar to a human disease in terms of etiology, it must mimic the behavioral characteristics of the disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Davids et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sagvolden et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>While Kv1.3-/-mice are suitable models of inattentiveness, deletion of the Kv1.3 channel in humans has not, as of yet, been linked to ADHD-type behaviors.</s><s>In future studies, Kv1.3-/-mice may afford utility in exploring attentional problems associated with anxiety or depression.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Kv1.3-/-mice exhibit increased anxiety in the
