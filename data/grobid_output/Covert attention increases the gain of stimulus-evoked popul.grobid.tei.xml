<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task procedures</head><p><s>On each trial, observers viewed a sequence of four bullseye stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Across blocks, we manipulated whether observers attended the bullseye stimuli (attend-stimulus condition) or attended the central fixation dot (attend-fixation condition).</s><s>In the attend-stimulus condition, observers monitored the sequence for one bullseye that was lower contrast than the rest (a bullseye target).</s><s>In the attend-fixation condition, observers monitored the fixation dot for a 100 ms decrement in contrast (a fixation target).</s><s>Contrast decrements for both the bullseye targets and fixation targets occurred on half of the trials in both conditions, and the trials that contained bullseye targets and fixation targets were determined independently.</s><s>We instructed subjects to disregard changes in the unattended stimulus.</s><s>Although past work has suggested that there may be differences in the cortical regions that support attention to peripheral locations and attention to fixated locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kelley et al., 2008)</ref>, we contrasted target-evoked responses in these conditions because of the powerful effect that this manipulation of attention has on stimulusevoked responses.</s><s>Furthermore, recent studies that have used fMRI to examine the effect of attention on spatially tuned population responses have manipulated attention in the same way (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sprague and Serences, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Itthipuripat et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, this manipulation of attention allows for comparison with these past studies.</s><s>Observers fixated a central dot (0.1°in diameter, 56.3% Weber contrast, i.e., 100 Â (L -L b )/L b , where L is stimulus luminance and L b is the background luminance) before pressing the spacebar to initiate each trial.</s><s>Each trial began with a 400 ms fixation display.</s><s>A peripheral cue (0.25°in diameter, 32.8% Weber contrast) was presented where the bullseye stimuli would appear for 300 ms.</s><s>On each trial, the bullseyes appeared at one of eight locations equally spaced around fixation at an eccentricity of 4°.</s><s>Each bullseye (1.6°in diameter, 0.12 cycles/°) appeared for 100 ms.</s><s>The cue and each of the bullseyes were separated by a variable interstimulus interval between 500 and 800 ms.</s><s>Bullseye targets (the bullseye that was lower contrast than the others) were never the first bullseye in the sequence.</s><s>Thus, the first bullseye of each trial established the pedestal contrast the trial (i.e., the contrast of the nontarget bullseyes).</s><s>Fixation targets (a 100 ms decrement in the contrast of the fixation dot) occurred at the same time as one of the bullseye stimuli; and like bullseye targets, fixation targets never occurred during the presentation of the first bullseye of the trial.</s><s>Both bullseye and fixation targets occurred on 50% of trials, determined randomly and independently for each stimulus to preclude accurate performance based on attention to the wrong aspect of the display.</s><s>On trials with both a bullseye target and fixation target (25% of trials), the timing of each target was determined independently, such that the targets co-occurred on ;33% of these trials.</s><s>The final bullseye in each trial was followed by a 500 ms blank display before the response screen appeared.</s><s>Each trial ended with a response screen that prompted subjects to report whether or not a target was presented in the relevant stimulus.</s><s>Subjects responded using the number pad of a standard keyboard (1 = target present, 2 = target absent).</s><s>The subject's response appeared above the fixation dot, and they could correct their response if they pressed the wrong key.</s><s>Finally, subjects confirmed their response by pressing the spacebar.</s></p><p><s>Experiment 1.</s><s>In Experiment 1, the pedestal contrast of the bullseye was always 89.1% Michelson contrast (100 Â (L max -L min )/(L max 1 L min ), where L max in the maximum luminance and L min is the minimum luminance).</s><s>Subjects completed a 3.5 h session.</s><s>The session began with a staircase procedure to adjust task difficulty (see Staircase procedures).</s><s>Subjects then completed 12-20 blocks (40 trials each) during which we recorded EEG.</s><s>Thus, subjects completed between 480 and 800 trials <ref type="bibr">(1920-3200 stimulus presentations)</ref>.</s><s>The blocks alternated between the attend-stimulus and attend-fixation conditions, and we counterbalanced task order across subjects.</s></p><p><s>Experiment 2. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the contrast of the bullseye stimuli.</s><s>We included 5 pedestal contrasts (6.25%, 12.5%, 25.0%, 50.0%, and 90.6% Michelson contrast).</s><s>Thus, there were 10 conditions in total (2 attention conditions Â 5 pedestal contrasts).</s><s>Subjects completed three sessions: a 2.5 h behavior session to adjust task difficulty in each condition (see Staircase procedures), followed by two 3.5 h EEG sessions.</s><s>All sessions were completed within a 10 d period.</s><s>Each block consisted of 104 trials: eight trials for each of the 10 conditions, and an Experimental task and inverted encoding model method.</s><s>a, Human observers viewed a series of four bullseye stimuli, each separated by a variable interstimulus interval (ISI).</s><s>The trial began with a peripheral cue that indicated where the bullseye stimuli would appear.</s><s>In the attend-stimulus condition, observers monitored the bullseye stimuli for one stimulus that was lower contrast than the others.</s><s>In the attend-fixation condition, observers monitored the fixation dot for a brief reduction in contrast.</s><s>b, We modeled power measured at each electrode as the weighted sum of eight spatially selective channels (here labeled C1-C8).</s><s>Each channel was tuned for one of the eight positions at which the stimuli could appear in the experiment (shown on the right).</s><s>Curves represent the predicted response of the eight channels as a function of stimulus position (i.e., the basis set).</s><s>c, In the training phase of the analysis, the predicted channel responses (determined by the basis set) served as regressors, allowing us to estimate a set of channel weights that specified the contribution of each spatial channel to power measured at each electrode.</s><s>d, In the testing phase of the analysis, we used the channel weights from the training phase to estimate the response of each channel given an independent test set of data.</s><s>e, We circularly shifted the channel response profiles for each stimulus position to a common center and averaged them to obtained a CTF shown as black circles (data simulated for illustrative purposes).</s><s>A channel offset of 0°on the x axis marks the channel tuned for the location of the stimulus.</s><s>We fitted an exponentiated cosine function to CTFs to measure their amplitude, baseline, and width (measured as FWHM).</s></p><p><s>additional 12 trials in each condition at the highest pedestal contrast (90.6% contrast) for the purpose of training the encoding model (see Training and testing data).</s><s>Each block included a break at the halfway point.</s><s>As in Experiment 1, the blocks alternated between the attendstimulus and attend-fixation conditions, and we counterbalanced task order across subjects.</s><s>We aimed to have each subject complete 20 blocks across the EEG sessions to obtain 160 testing trials for each condition (640 stimulus presentations), and 480 training trials (1920 stimulus presentations).</s><s>All subjects completed 20 blocks with the following exceptions: 3 subjects completed 18 blocks, and 1 subject completed 24 blocks.</s></p><p><s>In Experiment 2, we made one minor change from Experiment 1: the experimenter could manually provide feedback to the observer to indicate whether they noticed blinks or eye movements during the trial by pressing a key outside the recording chamber.</s><s>When feedback was provided, the text "blink" or "eye movement" was presented in red for 500 ms after the observer had made their response.</s></p></div>
