<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene coexpression analysis of synthetic brain samples accurately predicts differential expression among CNS cell classes</head><p><s>To illustrate the premise of our approach, we aggregated SC RNA-seq data from adult human brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">1</ref> to create synthetic samples that mimic the heterogeneity of intact tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>).</s><s>We performed unsupervised gene coexpression analysis to identify gene coexpression modules in each synthetic dataset that were maximally enriched with published markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">23</ref> of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, or neurons ('cell-class modules'; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>).</s><s>Intuitively, expression variation in a cell-class module primarily depends on the representation of that cell class in each sample.</s><s>Mathematically, the vector that explains the most variation in a coexpression module is its first principal component, or module 'eigengene' (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">24</ref> .</s><s>This reasoning suggests that a cell-class module eigengene should approximate the relative abundance of that cell class in each sample.</s><s>Because the precise cellular composition of each synthetic sample was known, we tested this hypothesis and found that actual cellular abundance was nearly indistinguishable from that predicted by cell-class module eigengenes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine the affinity of each gene for each cell-class module, we calculated the Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis measure of intramodular connectivity, k ME <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">25</ref> .</s><s>k ME is defined as the Pearson correlation between the expression pattern of a gene and a module eigengene.</s><s>In the special situation of a cell-class module, k ME therefore quantifies the similarity between the expression pattern of a gene and the relative abundance of that cell class in each sample.</s><s>Because each sample is a heterogeneous mixture of cells, high k ME for a cell-class module suggests that expression of the gene in that cell class is sensitive and specific.</s><s>We tested this hypothesis by performing differential expression analysis of SC RNA-seq data for each cell class, restricting our analysis to exactly the same cells used to construct the synthetic samples.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1B</ref>, the genes that are most significantly up-regulated in a cell class also have the highest k ME values for the corresponding cell-class module.</s><s>We obtained nearly identical results by aggregating SC RNA-seq data from adult mouse brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>These findings demonstrate that gene coexpression analysis of intact CNS samples can determine which genes are most differentially expressed among CNS cell classes.</s><s>More generally, our results suggest that it is not always necessary to physically isolate cells in order to ascertain their defining transcriptional features.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrative gene coexpression analysis of intact tissue samples reveals consensus transcriptional profiles of major CNS cell classes in humans</head><p><s>To determine consensus transcriptional profiles of human CNS cell classes, we analyzed 7221 CNS transcriptomes from 840 neurotypical adult humans by combining data from eight studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[33]</ref> and one resource (http://www.brainspan.org/).</s><s>These data were generated from intact postmortem tissue samples using diverse technology platforms (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) and collectively represent billions of cells.</s><s>Each sample was assigned to one of 19 broad neuroanatomical regions, resulting in 62 regional datasets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1C</ref>).</s><s>After data preprocessing and quality control, each dataset consisted of ≥25 samples (median: 76) (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>For each dataset, we performed unsupervised gene coexpression analysis and identified the module that was maximally enriched with published markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">23</ref> of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, or neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>PC1 of these modules was used to estimate the relative abundance of each cell class over all samples and calculate genome-wide k ME values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we combined k ME values for significant cell-class modules from all 62 datasets, producing a single value (z-score) for each gene that quantifies its global expression fidelity for each cell class (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Importantly, estimates of fidelity were highly robust to the choice of gene set used for enrichment analysis (especially for glia; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>).</s><s>Canonical markers consistently had high fidelity for the expected cell class and low fidelity for other cell classes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A-D</ref>).</s><s>Highfidelity genes were also significantly and specifically enriched with expected cell-class markers from multiple independent studies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A-D</ref>).</s><s>Compared to glia, the distribution of expression fidelity for neurons was compressed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A-D</ref>), likely reflecting neuronal heterogeneity among CNS regions.</s><s>Genome-wide estimates of expression fidelity for major cell classes are provided in Table <ref type="table">S3</ref> and on our web site (http://oldhamlab.ctec.ucsf.edu/).</s></p><p><s>To further explore how estimates of gene expression fidelity derived from intact tissue relate to gene expression in individual cells, we analyzed droplet-based SN RNA-seq data from neurotypical adult human brains.</s><s>Habib et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">4</ref> analyzed 14963 nuclei from cortical and hippocampal samples from five individuals, detecting a median of 529 unique genes/ nucleus.</s><s>Lake et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">34</ref> analyzed 35289 nuclei from cortical and cerebellar samples from six individuals, detecting a median of 719 unique genes/nucleus.</s><s>In general, expression patterns of high-fidelity genes were conserved in SN RNA-seq data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2E</ref>).</s><s>We extended these comparisons by examining concordance among top high-fidelity genes and top differentially expressed genes for each cell class from each SN study (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2F-I</ref>).</s><s>For all comparisons, overlap was highly significant (p &lt; 10 -15 ), but less so for neurons, which likely reflects differences among CNS regions analyzed in each study.</s><s>Given the shallow coverage that characterizes droplet-based SC/SN methods, we hypothesized that discordant results might also represent type II error in SN RNA-seq data (i.e.</s><s>dropouts).</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we compared expression levels of discordant and concordant genes.</s><s>For all cell classes, discordant genes were expressed significantly lower than concordant genes in our collection of 7221 intact human CNS samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2F-M</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, discordant genes were detected far less frequently than concordant genes in single nuclei from both studies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>).</s><s>For an orthogonal perspective, we analyzed expression of discordant genes in cell classes purified by immunopanning from adult human temporal lobe surgical resections <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">3</ref> .</s><s>In all cases, gene expression fidelity correctly predicted the dominant cellular source of mRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2N-Q</ref>).</s><s>These results underscore the sparse nature of current droplet-based SN RNAseq data.</s><s>Comparisons of fidelity and differential expression results for all genes are reported in Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>.</s></p></div>
