Animal Care and Use Com-mittee and Animal Care Program.</s><s>Eight adult, male Long-Evans rats served as behavioral subjects.</s><s>Rats were housed individually and kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle.</s><s>Before experimentation, the animals were habituated to the colony room and handled daily for a period of 1-2 weeks.</s><s>After this period, animals were placed on food restriction until they reached 85-90% free-fed weight.</s><s>Water was available continuously.</s><s>Rats were required to reach a minimum weight of 350 g before surgery and subsequent experimentation.</s></p><p><s>Visuospatial attention task.</s><s>Each day, animals completed 100 trials of a selective attention task in a circular arena with a 1.2 m diameter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Along the circumference of the arena were 36 light ports, located every 10°and standing 6.5 cm above the arena floor.</s><s>Animals were trained by approximation to remain in a 25 cm circular region in the center of the arena and scan the arena boundary for a light flash (ϳ150 ms).</s><s>The trial-to-trial probability of a light flash at any given location was defined by a "center" light that is most probable and one of two normal distributions (1.25 and 3 SD) around the center that described the probabilities of neighboring lights.</s><s>Only one distribution was used on any given record-ing day, and across days of testing, a single one of these distributions was repeatedly used such that several neurophysiological recordings could be obtained under asymptotic levels of performance.</s><s>Once several recordings were obtained under one distribution, the other distribution was used.</s></p><p><s>Light flash initiation only occurred when the animal was in the center ring and oriented such that the light would fall within a 120°space surrounding its longitudinal axis.</s><s>Thus, the flash location is not always directly in front of the animal, but always within its field-of-view.</s><s>Upon detection of a light flash, animals were required to travel to the arena perimeter and to identify the spatial location of the light flash with a nose-poke.</s><s>Upon returning to the arena center animals were rewarded for correct light source identification with a 1/2-piece Honey-Nut Cheerio (General Mills).</s><s>Incorrect identification yielded no reward.</s><s>Trials associated with failure to travel to the perimeter following light flash ("no-gos") constituted Ͻ5% of all trials in any animal once asymptotic performance was reached.</s></p><p><s>After the animal exhibited correct performance on Ͼ70% of trials across several days of training, recording experiments were initiated.</s><s>At this point, the subject underwent surgery for the implantation of chronic BF stereotrode and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) tetrode wires.</s></p><p><s>Surgery.</s><s>Rats were implanted with arrays of eight stereotrodes (25 micrometer tungsten with polyimide insulation; California Fine Wire) built into custom-fabricated microdrives.</s><s>Three such microdrive arrays were implanted in each animal with two targeting left and right BF (AP 0.2 mm, ML 2.8 mm, V 7.0 mm) and one targeting right PPC (AP Ϫ4, ML 2.5, V 0.5, 5 animals) or one targeting right BF and two targeting left and right PPC (2 animals).</s><s>Dorsal-ventral coordinates were chosen to permit slow movement of the recording wires into the desired BF (V 8 -9) and PPC (V 0.8 -1.5) target areas across days in which the animal was reintroduced to the task.</s><s>PPC neurons were analyzed previously and are not examined in the context of this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tingley et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recordings.</s><s>All electrodes were bundled into custom-built microdrives permitting movement in 40 m increments in the dorsalventral axis.</s><s>Signals were amplified at the level of the headstage connection (20ϫ), again at a pre-amp stage (50ϫ), and then to varying degrees, as appropriate, at the amplifier stager (additional 1-15ϫ).</s><s>Unit signals were bandpass filtered (450 Hz-8.8 kHz).</s><s>Candidate spike waveforms (exceeding an amplitude threshold) were recorded using SortClient (Plexon) at a sampling frequency of 40 kHz.</s><s>Waveform discrimination into individual units was performed manually using Plexon's Offline Sorter software.</s></p><p><s>The animal's position within the environment was detected from overhead images of the arena at 60 Hz. using Plexon's CinePlex Studio.</s><s>Tracking software picked up light from two differently colored LEDs clipped to a connector, embedded in the dental acrylic used to fix microdrives to the animal's skull.</s></p><p><s>Stereotrode bundles were adjusted across days as necessary to maintain collection of large numbers of high-amplitude action potential waveforms (as many as 60/day).</s><s>Data included in the present set of analyses were, for all individual animals, associated with different depths 2-m-diameter environment with 46 cm walls, having 36 evenly spaced light sources each 6.5 cm above the surface (red spheres).</s><s>A trial began when the animal stood upon a 25 cm platform at the arena center with head orientation such that the location of any individual trial's light flash lies somewhere within the 120°space that is centered on the longitudinal axis of the animal's head.</s><s>A light flash (ϳ150 ms) from a single location triggers a journey to identify the spatial location of the flash with a nose-poke.</s><s>Return to the center plate yields 1/2-piece Cheerio reward if the correct light source was identified.</s><s>The size of the red spheres depicts the approximate trial-to-trial probability for light flash locations (black spheres depict zero probability).</s><s>B, Mean firing rate vectors from six example neurons.</s><s>Firing rates were normalized by their maximum firing rate and range from 0 to 1 ( y-axes).</s><s>Colored arrows across the x-axes mark the behavioral events (light flash, nose poke, plate cross, and reward) after a time normalization procedure is used to align events across trials (see Materials and Methods for a full description of the time normalization procedure).</s><s>For a full description of BF neuron activity during this task, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tingley et al., 2014.</ref></s><s>(minimum 80 m separation) to greatly minimize the possibility that single neurons could contribute to the full dataset more than once.</s></p><p><s>Behavioral event analysis.</s><s>Position tracking data were analyzed using a custom MATLAB (MathWorks) guided user interface.</s><s>Each trial was closely examined to identify the position point associated with initial movement to the light source, and the sharp point of trajectory reversal associated with nose poke.</s><s>The time points at which the animal crossed back over the perimeter of the center plate and at which the animal stopped to consume reward were determined through automated analysis of positional data using MATLAB.</s><s>Trials in which the animal did not make ballistic, direct runs to and from the site of a nose-poke were not included so that trial-to-trial variability in task epoch durations were kept minimal relative to task epoch mean durations.</s></p><p><s>Time-normalization and firing rate calculation.</s><s>To enable comparison of neuronal activity across all trials and all behavioral epochs, we used a time normalization procedure to align neural data for light-onset, nosepoke, center-plate return, and stop/reward times.</s><s>Time normalization was accomplished by identifying the average time between light flash to nose-poke, nose-poke to center return, and center return to stop/reward across all trials and animals.</s><s>On average, it took the rodent 0.69 s to traverse to the light port after the light flash.</s><s>Animals took a mean of 1.41 s to return to the plate after nose poke and 0.54 s to stop to consume reward after having crossed onto the center plate.</s><s>We divided these periods into ϳ80 -90 ms time bins for each trial.</s><s>There are slight deviations from these averages for all animals across trials, thus, the bin duration was allowed to fluctuate slightly to allow for the behaviorally significant events to consistently occur at the same bin.</s><s>A 1 s period before light flash and after stop/reward was included in each trial to include stimulus expectation and reward consumption time periods, respectively.</s><s>By this process, we obtained vectors of time-normalized data in which a prelight flash period composed bins 1-12, light flash to nose-poke in bins 13-20, nosepoke to center-plate return in bins 21-36, center-plate return to stop/ reward in bins 37-42, and a post-trial reward period in bins 43-54.</s><s>For further detail on this time normalization procedure, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tingley et al., 2014.</ref></s><s>Histology.</s><s>Animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde under deep anesthesia.</s><s>Brains were removed, cut into 50 m sections, and Nissl stained.</s><s>The point of deepest electrode penetration was used in conjunction with microdrive adjustment records to determine the range of depths sampled for any given stereotrode bundle placement.</s><s>A schematic summary of final electrode bundle placements and sample histological data are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interspike interval analysis.</s><s>Interspike interval histograms were calculated for each neuron by determining the time differences between adjacent spikes across the entire recording.</s><s>These histograms were then normalized by the interspike interval bin with the highest count, resulting in histograms ranging from 0 to 1.</s><s>These histograms were then sorted by their maximal interspike interval frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A custom clustering algorithm, that uses principal component analysis and a mixture of Gaussians, was then implemented to determine whether classes of interspike interval histograms could be separated by their shapes.</s><s>Principal component analysis was used to reduce dimensionality, and to quantify the variability in the shapes of all 1428 interspike interval histograms.</s><s>The first two principal components for the interspike interval histograms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>, inset) together explained 62% of the variance in the data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The two principal component 'matching' scores for all 1428 interspike interval histograms are plotted as a density heat map in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>.</s><s>The Gaussian mixture model was applied to this full population of values, and defined the centers and SD for two subpopulations of neurons that share characteristic interspike interval shapes.</s></p><p><s>We next examined the activation patterns of these two groups of cells in relation to the selective attention task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>For each timenormalized bin across the task (y-axes of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>; 54 bins total), we found the subset of neurons at or Ͼ80% of their maximal firing rate.</s><s>For this "active" population of neurons we averaged their interspike interval histograms.</s><s>This resulted in 54 average ISI histograms, shown across all task phases in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref> (left).</s><s>Each row in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref> (left) is the average interspike interval histogram of the most active subpopulation of BF neurons at a given phase of the task.</s><s>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref> (right), we compare, for each time bin, the observed mean of interspike interval histograms from the set of active neurons to the mean interspike interval histograms for randomly selected subsets of the full set of 1428 interspike interval histograms.</s><s>The number of randomly selected interspike interval histograms is determined by the number of active cells in each time bin.</s><s>In this way, we estimate the extent to which bursting versus nonbursting neurons are active relative to what might be expected based on their proportions in the full dataset.</s></p><p><s>Cell assembly analysis.</s><s>Temporal coordination of spike timing among neurons recorded simultaneously from separate stereotrodes was assessed using a generalized linear
