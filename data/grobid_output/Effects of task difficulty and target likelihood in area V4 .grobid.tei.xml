<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus presentation</head><p><s>Stimuli were presented on a calibrated CRT video display (screen width: 36 or 39 cm; 75 Hz; 1,600 ϫ 1,200 pixels) positioned 58 cm from the animal.</s><s>The average screen luminance was 23 cd/m 2 .</s><s>No other visible light sources were in the recording room.</s><s>Stimuli were achromatic 100% contrast Gabor patches with the same average luminance as the background, temporally counterphased in contrast with a 4-Hz sinusoid.</s></p><p><s>Gabor stimuli were adjusted in location, size, spatial frequency, and orientation to best drive each neuron isolated for data collection, as assessed by listening to spikes on an audio monitor.</s><s>Receptive field centers ranged from 0.7 to 5.6°in eccentricity (medians: 1.5°for Animal 1; 3.8°for Animal 2; 2.9°for Animal 3).</s><s>SD values of the Gabors used ranged from 0.2 to 1.5°(medians: 0.4°for Animal 1; 0.5°f or Animal 2; 0.7°for Animal 3).</s><s>Spatial frequencies were between 0.24 and 6.0 cycles/deg (medians: 2.7 cycles/deg for Animal 1; 1.0 cycle/deg for Animal 2; 3.2 cycles/deg for Animal 3).</s><s>Four neurons did not have obvious orientation selectivity during data collection; data were collected from these neurons after assigning an arbitrary preferred orientation.</s><s>These neurons were not distinct in other ways.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral task</head><p><s>Animals did an orientation change detection task using Gabor patches (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>At the beginning of each trial, the animals were required to press and hold down a lever (Animals 1 and 3 only) and to acquire and maintain fixation on a white square (0.25°width) presented near the center of the screen.</s><s>Two Gabor patches appeared on the screen during each trial.</s><s>One, presented within the receptive field of a neuron under study, was oriented either parallel to or orthogonal to the estimated preferred orientation of the cell.</s><s>A second Gabor, rotated by Ϯ45°relative to the receptive field Gabor but otherwise identical, was presented in a position diametrically opposed across the fixation spot.</s><s>Thus whereas the receptive field stimulus was always either the preferred orientation or 90°from preferred, the stimulus in the opposite hemifield was always Ϯ45°from the preferred orientation.</s><s>The Gabor was offset in orientation so that the task could not be solved by detecting small differences in orientation between the two stimuli.</s><s>The animals were trained to maintain fixation while monitoring the Gabor patches for a change in orientation.</s></p><p><s>The animals were trained to respond when either Gabor changed orientation by either releasing a lever (Animals 1 and 3) or making a saccade to the changed Gabor (Animal 2) within 600 ms to signal that they had detected the change; for this they received a reward.</s><s>A high tone was played as auditory feedback for a correct response.</s><s>If they failed to maintain fixation or responded Ͻ100 ms after the change, the trial was aborted immediately (with a low tone to indicate an incorrect response) and no reward was given.</s><s>Also, if they failed to respond to the correct target within the specified time window after a change occurred (missed trial), the low tone was played and no reward was given.</s></p><p><s>Orientation changes were restricted to occur when the contrast of the counterphasing Gabor crossed zero, which happened eight times per second.</s><s>Across trials, the times of the orientation change were exponentially distributed with a median of about 2 s and a minimum of 500 ms.</s><s>If no change had occurred after 10 s (8 s for Animal 2), the trial was ended automatically and counted as correct.</s><s>To encourage the animals to wait for later orientation changes, the size of the reward increased with time elapsed before the orientation change.</s><s>1. Behavioral task.</s><s>A: each trial began with fixation on a small spot at the center of the screen.</s><s>Animals were then presented with counterphasing Gabor stimuli at 2 spatial locations.</s><s>After a variable period, one of the stimuli would change orientation.</s><s>Animal responded to this change either by releasing a lever (Animals 1 and 3) or making a saccade toward the changed stimulus (Animal 2).</s><s>B: task difficulty was controlled by changing the size of the orientation change.</s><s>In easy blocks of trials, the orientation change was 90°.</s><s>In difficult blocks, it was set to a challenging size.</s><s>Randomly inserted probe trials had orientation changes that were intermediate.</s><s>These were used to assess whether the animal's performance was affected by the likely location and task difficulty.</s></p><p><s>Trials were performed in blocks of four different types that were pseudorandomly interleaved.</s><s>Blocks were defined by task difficulty and spatial location of attention.</s><s>Each block was either 16 or 32 trials long, and at least two repetitions of each block type were collected for all neurons included in the analysis.</s></p><p><s>To bias the spatial location of attention, in each block one of the two Gabors was much more likely (87.5% of trials) to change in orientation (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The animals' attention was directed toward the likely target using instruction trials, in which only one Gabor appeared, at the beginning of the block.</s><s>On a subset of behavioral experiments, a third attentional condition was used, in which instruction trials cued both Gabor locations at the beginning of each block.</s><s>In these trials, the animal had no information about which stimulus was more likely to change in orientation (and both were equally likely).</s></p><p><s>Task difficulty was manipulated by varying the size of the orientation change that the animals had to detect at the likely location (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).</s><s>Trials were performed at two levels of difficulty (referred to here as difficult and easy).</s><s>The orientation changes in easy blocks were 90°.</s><s>The size of the orientation change in the difficult blocks was adjusted for each stimulus configuration to maintain the animals' average performance on difficult trials within a target range.</s><s>The orientation changes in difficult blocks were between 5 and 9°for Animal 1, between 4 and 15°for Animal 2, and between 8 and 14°for Animal 3. The size of the change used during data collection for each neuron was fixed.</s><s>Orientation changes at the unlikely location were always "probe trials," described below, for which the size of the orientation change was held constant at a value intermediate to the easy and difficult values.</s></p><p><s>Because the animals were required to compare only the orientation of the stimulus after the change to its orientation immediately before, there was little demand on working memory, compared with other tasks, such as match-to-sample.</s><s>This allowed us to separate increases in attentional load arising from increased task difficulty from increases in memory load <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rees et al. 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Also, this task required the animals to monitor stimuli over a period of time for infrequent and unpredictable targets.</s><s>This type of task is thought to draw on the intensive dimension of attention, as opposed to the spatial dimension of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Parasuraman 1984)</ref>, so that changes in difficulty were likely to change the amount of attention devoted to the task.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of behavior</head><p><s>Although the animals were encouraged to direct their attention to a particular spatial location by biasing target likelihood, and were encouraged to change the amount of effort they devoted to the task by changing task difficulty, we needed a behavioral measure that would show whether these manipulations succeeded in changing the ani-mals' behavior.</s><s>To measure the ability of the animals to respond to orientation changes as a function of target likelihood and block difficulty, we used infrequent and randomly inserted probe trials that occurred equally often at both likely and unlikely locations, and equally often in difficult and easy blocks (25% of all trials).</s><s>The size of the orientation change on probe trials was usually intermediate to the difficult and easy changes (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>, 7-20°) and did not vary between easy and difficult blocks for a given cell.</s><s>For Animal 1, the orientation change on probe trials was sometimes set equal to or smaller than the difficult changes to prevent saturation of performance on probe trials.</s><s>Because the stimulus was the same for probe trials in all conditions, differences in the animals' abilities to detect the orientation change on probe trials could be attributed to changes internal to the animals related to the locus of attention or the difficulty of the block <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Spitzer et al. 1988)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neurophysiological data collection</head><p><s>We made small craniotomies over V4 while the animals were anesthetized with 15 mg/kg ketamine, leaving the dura intact.</s><s>A new craniotomy was made approximately every 3 wk.</s><s>In daily recording sessions, transdural Pt/Ir electrodes (0.8 -2.2 M⍀ at 1 kHz) were positioned using an X-Y stage.</s><s>They were advanced through the dura by a hydraulic microdrive.</s><s>After the stage and microdrive were attached to the chamber each day, the chamber was filled with sterile mineral oil to reduce pulsations.</s><s>Animals received two to four craniotomies, with one to 13 penetrations made in each craniotomy.</s></p><p><s>Recordings were made in gray matter within 4 mm from the cortical surface.</s><s>Signals from the microelectrodes were filtered, amplified, and sent to an oscilloscope and audio monitor.</s><s>The animals performed the task as described above while the electrode was advanced through cortex.</s><s>After a unit was isolated, the task was changed briefly (about 5 min) to a simple fixation task while stimuli were optimized for the cell.</s><s>Individual units were isolated using a window discriminator and spike times were recorded with 1-ms resolution by the same computer that controlled and monitored the behavioral task.</s><s>Time bases were synchronized with the vertical retrace of the video display.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neurophysiological data analysis</head><p><s>For the assessment of the effects of spatial attention and task difficulty on neuronal responses, data were analyzed from the first time an orientation change could have occurred (500 ms after stimulus onset) up to the time at which the orientation actually changed on that trial, yielding a variable amount of data per trial.</s><s>We recorded data from Ն32 trials in each of the four behavioral conditions (2 likely locations ϫ 2 block difficulties).</s><s>Spontaneous firing rates were computed from a 250-ms period in each trial after the animal had achieved fixation but before the stimulus appeared.</s><s>Only correct trials were included in these analyses.</s></p><p><s>All tests of statistical significance were computed relative to a 0.05 false positive rate, unless otherwise specified.</s><s>Statistical tests were performed using Matlab Toolbox functions, where available, and computed according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zar (1999)</ref> otherwise.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral performance</head><p><s>After several months of training, each animal developed a stable pattern of behavior.</s><s>All animals performed substantially better on easy trials than on difficult trials (Animal 1: easy 99.5% correct, difficult 89.7%; Animal 2: easy 98.3%, difficult 70.3%; Animal 3: easy 94.0%, difficult 86.0%).</s><s>Behavioral performance on probe trials that were presented pseudoran- Easy blocks consisted of mostly 90°changes, whereas in difficult blocks most of the changes were Ͻ10°.</s><s>In each block, one location was more likely (87.5% of trials) to contain the change.</s><s>Behavior was assessed with probe trials that were similar in difficulty to the regular trials of the difficult blocks and occurred with equal frequency at both spatial locations and in both easy and difficult blocks.</s><s>Animals were instructed as to the identity of the likely location at the beginning of each new block.</s></p><p><s>domly and infrequently in all behavioral conditions is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Difficulty and target likelihood both affected performance on probe trials.</s><s>These effects were robust, indicating that the animals were motivated to perform and that they were well trained on the task by the time recording began.</s><s>SE values of the binomial statistic are smaller than the points in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.

the strategies of Animals 1 and 2 would be dominated by their initial training and that their neurophysiology would be unchanged by retraining.</s><s>Similar neurophysiological differences after retraining would not resolve whether the differences were determined by initial training or unidentified factors.</s><s>The relationship between training and neurophysiology could be addressed conclusively if additional animals were examined, but power analysis indicates that even if the effect size for training approached five, at least three more animals would need to be trained and recorded to provide a statistically reliable answer (90% power, ␣ ϭ 0.05).</s><s>More testing could easily reveal that the effect size is appreciably smaller than this, so that far more animals would be needed to provide sufficient statistical power to draw conclusions about the effects of training.</s><s>For this reason it would be impractical to attempt to resolve this question with existing methods.</s></p><p><s>A direct relationship between neuronal responses in V4 and behavioral performance seems plausible for the data from Animal 3, where the population response in each behavioral condition is correlated with the animal's performance in that condition.</s><s>The data from Animals 1 and 2, however, do not have such a direct relationship to behavior because these animals performed poorly on unlikely stimuli in the difficult condition, although the neuronal responses to such stimuli strengthened.</s><s>Previous anatomical and lesion studies have suggested a special role for V4 in the process of selecting relevant visual stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Desimone et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">De Weerd et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schiller and Lee 1991)</ref>, and in Animal 3 it appears that, in the difficult condition, the representation of the unattended stimulus is suppressed at or before this stage of processing.</s><s>The data from Animals 1 and 2, however, show that enhanced neuronal responses do not always translate into improved behavioral performance.</s></p><p><s>Although difficulty had different effects on the representation of stimuli away from the focus of attention, all three animals were consistent in one respect.</s><s>For all three the difference in response strength between the high-likelihood and low-likelihood targets increased with increasing difficulty and this was associated with the greater difference in behavioral performance in the difficult condition.</s><s>This is consistent with the suggestion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bisley and Goldberg (2003)</ref> that behavioral performance for a given target depends on the pattern of activity across populations of neurons and that the relative priority given to different visual stimuli follows the relative activity of the cortical neurons that represent them.</s><s>They also described that the advantage in behavioral performance for one stimulus was larger when responses to that stimulus were larger relative to another.</s><s>Their results and ours support the notion that a monotonic function relates relative behavioral performance for two stimuli and the relative strength of neuronal responses to those stimuli.</s><s>It remains to be seen whether that relative neuronal response predicts relative behavioral performance in cluttered displays that more closely approximate natural viewing conditions.</s><s>It also remains unclear what weighting rules for neuronal activity across the representation of the image determine the absolute behavioral performance for a given stimulus.</s></p><p><s>Although the pattern of behavior shown by Animals 1 and 2 was statistically significant and reliable, these animals showed less impairment for detecting changes at the unlikely location in the difficult blocks than did Animal 3. The difference in the physiology between the animals may reflect the degree to which they used the spatial cue to influence the distribution of attention in space; and, whereas the behavior of all three animals was qualitatively the same, strong suppression of behavioral responses to irrelevant stimuli may be generated only by early suppression of sensory representations of those stimuli.</s><s>Behavioral and neurophysiological differences are commonly seen between different human and animal subjects performing a given task <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Britten et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Huk and Heeger 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Different behavioral strategies may account for some of this variance.</s></p><p><s>Our results demonstrate that both the distribution of attention between two stimuli and the amount of attention available for a given task are dynamic, depending on the target likelihood at different locations, the attentional load of the task, and on the strategy of the observer.</s><s>The choice of a strategy for allocating attention may depend on details of task structure, training history, and specific instructions to the observer.</s><s>One implication of this is that quantitative comparisons of attentional modulations between studies or even task conditions are problematic and should be approached cautiously.</s><s>Another implication is that the establishment of a veridical amount of attentional modulation for a neuron or a neural structure is not possible.</s><s>The magnitude of attention effects observed in a given visual area will vary with task design; moreover, even within the same task, different subjects may choose to solve the task in different ways, affecting the observed attentional modulation.</s><s>These results also imply that experiments designed to examine the interaction of other stimulus or task features with spatial attention must be careful to control for possible changes in task difficulty or subject strategy.</s></p><p><s>We also suggest that whereas one subject chooses to reallocate attention in space without changing the amount of attention devoted to the task, another may increase the overall amount of attention available for the task by increased vigilance.</s><s>Attention is clearly not a fixed resource, but can vary on a timescale no longer than minutes.</s><s>This does not mean that there are no limits on attention, however.</s><s>There are many ways in which more enhancement of neuronal responses by spatial attention may not result in improved performance.</s><s>Computational studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dayan et al. 2000)</ref> have shown that learning of reward contingencies in a model system without resource constraints may result in behavioral patterns like those attributed to fixed-capacity attentional mechanisms.</s><s>Thus even if there were an unlimited capacity to increase neuronal firing rates there would not necessarily be an unlimited capacity to improve behavioral responses.</s><s>There may also be other costs, such as metabolic constraints, that influence the decision to increase vigilance or to redistribute attention in space.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Howard Hughes Medical Institute and 2 Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas Submitted 11 October 2005; accepted in final form 12 July 2006</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
