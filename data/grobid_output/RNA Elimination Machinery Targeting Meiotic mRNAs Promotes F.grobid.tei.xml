<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Besides previously reported heterochromatin loci, we reproducibly detected H3K9me at several additional sites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>These heterochromatin islands encompass ~30 loci, which include genes located adjacent to ncRNAs and a few long terminal repeats (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Overlapping transcription at convergent genes is believed to target H3K9me via RNAi <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>, whereas heterochromatin islands correspond to both convergent and non-convergent loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>A distinctive feature of heterochromatin islands is their preferential association with meiotic genes, which are silenced during vegetative growth (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>Most H3K9me enrichment corresponds to either open reading frames or 3′ ends of genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), consistent with transcription-coupled processes targeting H3K9me.</s><s>Histone H3K4 methylation, a modification linked to RNA polymerase II transcription, could be detected at the 5′ ends of genes within heterochromatin islands (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Factors that bind H3K9me and their associated effectors localize to heterochromatin islands: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) detected the Clr4 complex (ClrC) subunit Raf2, Swi6/HP1, as well as posttranscriptional and transcriptional silencing activities, such as RNAi effector complex RITS (Chp1 and Ago1) and SHREC (Clr3 and Mit1), respectively, at heterochromatin islands (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, Dcr1 localizes to three genes corresponding to islands <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>.</s><s>We also found the cohesin-loading factor Mis4, which interacts with Swi6/HP1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>, and the cohesin sub unit Rad21 enriched at meiotic heterochromatin islands (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Our analysis identified the antisilencing factor Epe1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12)</ref> at heterochromatin islands (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>The loss of Epe1 caused the spread of H3K9me at most heterochromatin islands and at subtelomeric regions (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>, A and B).</s><s>Moreover, epe1Δ cells showed several H3K9me peaks that were not detected in wild-type cells (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3C</ref>).</s><s>More than 30 additional peaks mapped to ~100 convergent and nonconvergent loci.</s><s>As in the case of the wild type, a major fraction of heterochromatin islands in epe1Δ mapped to meiotic genes.</s><s>Thus, the S. pombe genome appears to harbor numerous heterochromatin nucleation sites, but heterochromatin assembly at many of these loci is suppressed by factors such as Epe1.</s></p><p><s>Given that heterochromatin islands map to transcribed regions, we wondered if RNAi targets heterochromatin to these loci.</s><s>The loss of Dicer (Dcr1) or Argonaute (Ago1) caused only partial or no reduction in H3K9me at heterochromatin islands except island 5, which showed considerable reduction of H3K9me (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, de novo targeting of H3K9me to ssm4 and mei4 occurred even in the absence of Ago1, albeit at levels lower than those of the wild type (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4C</ref>), suggesting that additional RNAi-independent mechanism(s) target heterochromatin to meiotic loci.</s><s>We also investigated the effects of histone deacetylases (HDACs), including Sir2 and SHREC (3), implicated in heterochromatin formation.</s><s>Deletion of sir2 encoding a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidedependent HDAC (3) caused defective H3K9me at the majority of islands (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S5A</ref>), but SHREC subunits were dispensable (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S5B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next sought to investigate the mechanism of heterochromatin assembly at meiotic loci.</s><s>Meiotic genes such as ssm4 are transcribed during vegetative growth, but their transcripts are processed by the exosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>.</s><s>The loss of Rrp6, an exosome-associated 3′-to-5′ exonuclease <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>, led to the accumulation of ssm4 mRNA and a long RNA, which initiated from a promoter upstream of tpr1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>When production of ssm4 mRNA and the long RNA was disrupted by insertion of ura4 transcription terminator at the ssm4 promoter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), the resulting strain showed the loss of H3K9me at the ssm4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>We also generated a strain in which ura4 terminator specifically blocks long RNA, without affecting ssm4 mRNA (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>ssm4 mRNA was sufficient to nucleate heterochromatin, as disruption of the long RNA did not abolish H3K9me (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>Based on these data, transcription is required for H3K9me at the ssm4 meiotic gene.</s></p><p><s>The elimination of meiotic mRNAs in vegetative cells involves the YTH domain-containing protein Mmi1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Mmi1 binds mRNAs containing determinant of selective removal (DSR) sequences and mediates their degradation by the exosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>.</s><s>Meiotic mRNA suppression also requires the Red1 protein, which interacts with Mmi1, the exosome, and pre-mRNA 3′-processing factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>.</s><s>We wondered if the RNA elimination machinery targets H3K9me.</s><s>Insertion of the mei4 DSR at the 3′ untranslated region of ura4 resulted in H3K9me at this site, especially when ura4-DSR was expressed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), and ssm4 lacking its DSR failed to nucleate H3K9me (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>More importantly, the loss of Mmi1, Red1, or Rrp6, which caused accumulation of DSR-containing transcripts (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S9A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15)</ref>, abolished H3K9me at both ssm4 and mei4, as determined by ChIP and ChIP-chip (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>).</s><s>At other meiotic loci, we also observed defects in H3K9me in these mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10A</ref>), but we saw no change at heterochromatin islands targeting nonmeiotic loci, such as islands 14 and 15 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Based on these results, RNA elimination factors are required for the assembly of heterochromatin at meiotic genes.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with RNA elimination factors directly promoting H3K9me, we found Red1 and Rrp6 enriched at ssm4 and mei4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref> and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S9B</ref>).</s><s>Red1 was also detected at heterochromatin islands at other meiotic genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Localization of Red1 correlated with its requirement for H3K9me at individual loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10A</ref>).</s><s>Red1 could not be detected at islands that showed no reduction in H3K9me in red1Δ cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10A</ref>).</s><s>rec8 and spo5 genes, which encode DSR-containing transcripts degraded by a Mmi1-based mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>, lack detectable levels of H3K9me (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10B</ref>).</s><s>The lack of H3K9me enrichment correlated with the absence of Red1 binding at these loci (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10B</ref>).</s><s>The correlation between localization of RNA elimination factors and H3K9me prompted us to investigate interactions between these factors.</s><s>Immunoprecipitation analyses detected RNA elimination factor Red1 interacting with Clr4 and another ClrC subunit, Raf1, and that these interactions were not sensitive to deoxyribonuclease I or ribonuclease A treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>These data demonstrate that Red1 is a component of a protein network involved in the elimination of meiotic RNAs that recruits Clr4 to assemble heterochromatin islands.</s></p><p><s>Heterochromatin and its associated factors such as RNAi components might promote meiotic gene silencing.</s><s>Loss of Ago1 alone did not cause detectable changes in ssm4 and mei4 silencing (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>).</s><s>However, the effects of RNAi machinery might be masked by the activity of the exosome.</s><s>Because the exosome is required for both mRNA processing and H3K9me, it was not possible to study the effects of heterochromatin factors in the rrp6Δ background.</s><s>However, the degradation of meiotic mRNAs by the exosome requires the poly(A) binding protein Pab2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18)</ref>, which does not interact with Red1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>.</s><s>pab2Δ impaired the degradation of transcripts but maintained considerable levels of H3K9me at meiotic loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>).</s><s>When pab2Δ was combined with clr4Δ, the resultant double mutant showed cumulative accumulation of ssm4 mRNA and long RNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest a role for Clr4 in silencing meiotic genes during vegetative growth.</s><s>Clr4 might directly promote RNA processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref> and/or facilitate loading of silencing effectors, such as chromatin modifiers and the RNAi machinery (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), via H3K9me-bound chromodomain proteins.</s><s>Indeed, clr4Δ cells are defective in the localization of Swi6 and the RITS subunit Chp1 at ssm4 and mei4 loci <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Meiotic gene expression is induced in response to sexual differentiation signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Nitrogen starvation arrests cells in G 1 phase of the cell cycle and triggers sexual differentiation.</s><s>However, growth arrest can be reversed by the resupply of nitrogen.</s><s>Nitrogen deprivation caused severe reduction in H3K9me at meiotic genes but had no effect on heterochromatin at centromeres, telomeres, and the mat locus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>, and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12A</ref>).</s><s>The observed effect was specific to nitrogen starvation and was not observed when cells were arrested in G 1 phase (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12B</ref>).</s><s>Appreciable reduction in H3K9me could be detected after 4 hours of nitrogen starvation (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13A</ref>).</s><s>The rapid loss of H3K9me involves Epe1, because disassembly of heterochromatin islands is delayed in epe1Δ mutant (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13A</ref>).</s><s>Resupplying nitrogen to starved cells restored heterochromatin to meiotic loci within 24 hours after the addition of nitrogen source to growth medium (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, heterochromatin islands at meiotic loci are developmentally regulated.</s></p><p><s>Our analysis expands the repertoire of loci targeted by heterochromatin and uncovers a mechanism for heterochromatin assembly.</s><s>Heterochromatin formation at meiotic loci requires transcription but can occur independent of RNAi or a specific gene orientation.</s><s>We suggest that Mmi1 binding to DSR-containing RNAs engages Red1 and the exosome to nucleate heterochromatin by targeting Clr4/Suv39h (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14</ref>).</s><s>Because Red1-exosome degrades many RNAs and certain Mmi1 targets (e.g., rec8 and spo5) lack H3K9me, it is likely that additional factors, including specific features of RNAs, are important for loading heterochromatin.</s><s>In this regard, Red1 and Mmi1-cooperate with pre-mRNA 3′-processing factors to promote hyperadenylation of target transcripts, which is critical for meiotic gene silencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>.</s><s>Red1 and 3′-processing factors may be components of a mechanism that couples degradation of meiotic RNAs to heterochromatin assembly.</s><s>Note that the Rik1 subunit of the Clr4 complex, which suppresses accumulation of aberrant RNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>, resembles cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors involved in pre-mRNA 3′processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>.</s><s>Similar to facultative heterochromatin in higher eukaryotes, heterochromatin islands are remodeled in response to cellular differentiation signals.</s><s>These results suggest that signaling mechanisms exist that feed into heterochromatin pathways to facilitate coordinated changes in gene expression and reprogram the genome for other chromosomal events during meiotic induction.</s><s>Similar pathways involving cotranscriptional RNA processing factors might promote RNA-and transcription-coupled epigenetic modification observed in other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr"
