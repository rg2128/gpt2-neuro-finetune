HIS, n = 2040; p &lt; 10 -16 ; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, two-sided) consistent with findings in the first subpopulation.</s><s>To allow for comparisons across crossings, further analyses were based on response ratios.</s><s>The ratio of CS response amplitudes (Ala/His;

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>In the same fish, the amplitude ratio of responses to odors that were not used in conditioning (Ser versus His or Trp) was not related to behavioral preference (r = 0.00, p = 1;
