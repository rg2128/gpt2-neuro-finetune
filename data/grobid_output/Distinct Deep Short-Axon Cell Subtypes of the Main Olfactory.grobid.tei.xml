primarily on their axonal and dendritic morphologies.</s><s>However, recently their intrinsic electrical properties, gene expression profiles and firing behavior in relation to ongoing network activity have all been taken into account.</s><s>Such combined molecular, morphological and physiological approaches have provided compelling evidence for the astonishing diversity of INs and for the variety of roles they play in neuronal networks.</s><s>The classical view regarding the connectivity of INs has been that they primar-ily innervate the principal cells, and to a smaller extent each other.</s><s>However, additional populations of hippocampal and neocortical INs have been revealed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acsa ´dy et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gulya ´s et

GABAergic INs, and the presence of such cells has also been suggested to occur in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Mugnaini et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gracia-Llanes et al., 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the MOB, information from olfactory sensory neurons is relayed to higher olfactory areas by glutamatergic principal cells, the mitral and tufted (M/T) cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Shepherd et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Primary olfactory axons synapse on the apical tufts of M/T cells in spherical neuropil regions called glomeruli.</s><s>The principal cells are under the control of several GABAergic IN types.</s><s>In the glomerular layer (GL), the highly diverse periglomerular cells (PGCs) exert their GABAergic influence on the apical tufts of M/T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kosaka et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Shepherd et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>In the external plexiform layer

demonstrated that GCs receive GABA A receptor (GABA A R)-mediated inhibition from a subpopulation of inframitral short-axon cells (SACs), called Blanes cells, but it remains to be seen whether other cell types also contribute to the GABAergic control of GCs.</s><s>Short-axon cells form another, rather diverse GABAergic IN population distinct from the numerically dominant GCs and PGCs <ref

electrical properties, their synaptic inputs, and their postsynaptic targets.</s><s>Here, we aimed to provide a functional, molecular, and morphological characterization of dSACs to reveal their place in the olfactory bulb network.</s><s>Our results demonstrate several new aspects of the diversity of dSACs, revealing three dSAC subtypes, each of which is specialized to regulate network activity
