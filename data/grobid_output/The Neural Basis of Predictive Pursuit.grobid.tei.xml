repertoires <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>To pursue effectively, a forager needs to perform a series of computations: it must maintain a representation of its current position relative to that of the prey, then compute a best path to capture the prey, then execute that path.</s><s>Because the ability to perform such computations can determine foraging success, pursuit has likely been an important driver of our cognition and its underlying brain systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>One way to improve pursuit effectiveness is to predict the future position of the prey and head towards the predicted position <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Estimating future positions can be done using the prey's basic Newtonian variables (most importantly, its current position, velocity, and acceleration) and can be improved using additional (potentially even recursive) variables, such as predictions about the likely evasive strategy of the prey in response to the predator's own future path.</s><s>By using such information, the forager may be able to formulate a representation of the predicted future position of the prey.</s><s>The ability of non-human animals to actively predict positions of prey during pursuit is poorly understood.</s><s>Nonetheless, predictive pursuit is an important part of the repertoire of many species.</s></p><p><s>Prediction is important for many cognitive and behavioral processes, not just foraging.</s><s>These include motor control, economic decision-making, and abstract long-term planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> .</s><s>There is some evidence that foraging animals can predict the long-term future -that is, they may be able to travel mentally in time and see themselves in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>However, observations about animal prediction tend to be limited to a small number of highly adapted species in unique contexts.</s><s>And, while future planning of movements is relatively wellstudied, the ability to predict future positions of prey during dynamic behavior with rapidly changing goals -which feed into but are distinct from motor plans -is not.</s><s>In the context of pursuit, a critical question is whether future-predicting foragers maintain a specific representation of potential future prey positions and whether those representations (assuming they exist) make use of specialized processes.</s></p><p><s>Although the neural bases of predictive pursuit remain unclear, we can draw some inferences about its likely neuroanatomy.</s><s>In particular, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been implicated in prediction, prospection, and related processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> .</s><s>For example, neuroimaging studies indicate that human dACC is a key region for economic prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , for prospective reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and for more open-ended prospective processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>The dACC is well-positioned for this role: it receives broad inputs from limbic and cognitive systems, integrates these, and generates high-level control signals that regulate behavior in an abstract and high-level way <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Here, we examined the future predicting abilities of rhesus macaques using a novel virtual pursuit task.</s><s>Subjects used a joystick to move an avatar in an open two-dimensional field displayed on a computer screen.</s><s>Subjects, controlling the avatar, pursued a fleeing prey item that used an artificially intelligent (AI) algorithm to avoid predation.</s><s>By examining the properties of a generative model fit to our data, we found that our subjects moved towards extrapolated future positions of prey rather than just pointing towards the preys' present positions.</s><s>Our subjects' made their predictions based on three Newtonian variables associated with the current state, but not other factors that could further improve predictions (such as the effect of the subject's movements on the future position of the prey).</s><s>We also found that neurons in dACC were selective for those three Newtonian variables (and not others), indicating that responses in this region provide sufficient information to generate the types of predictions our subjects made.</s><s>Finally, we found that dACC neurons used a spatial code to explicitly represent the predicted future position of the prey, and that this future representation is multiplexed with the representation of current Newtonian variables.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral results</head><p><s>Three macaques (Macaca mulatta, subjects K, H, and C) used a joystick to control the position of an avatar (a yellow or purple circle) moving continuously and smoothly in a rectangular field on a computer screen (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Supplementary Video 1 and Methods).</s><s>On each trial, subjects had up to 20 seconds to capture a prey item (a fleeing colored square) to obtain a juice reward.</s><s>Prey avoided the avatar with a deterministic strategy that combined repulsion from the subject's current position with repulsion from the walls of the field.</s><s>The prey item was drawn randomly from a set of five, identified by color, that differed in maximum velocity and associated reward size.</s></p><p><s>All subjects showed stable behavior within twelve 2-hour training sessions that followed a longer training period on joystick use (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>All data presented here were collected after the training sessions (number of trials, K: 3229; H: 3890; C: 2512).</s><s>Subjects successfully captured the prey in over 95% of trials and, on successful trials, did so in an average of 5.04 seconds (K: 4.26 sec; H: 5.32 sec; C: 5.54 sec) and median of 3.62 seconds (K: 3.36sec; H: 3.73 sec; C: 3.93 sec).</s><s>Subjects' performance varied lawfully with prey type, indicating sensitivity to manipulation of reward and/or difficulty (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral evidence of future state prediction</head><p><s>For analysis purposes, we split all data into one-second segments (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Within each segment, we calculated the error (sum of squares) between the model (see below) and the behavior at each frame (i.e., each 16.67 ms).</s><s>For each segment, we computed the minimum point on a 201×201 matrix of intensities for each parameter pair (force by time, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, see below).</s><s>We then averaged over all segments and all trials, separately for the three subjects.</s></p><p><s>We developed a generative model of behavior (see Methods).</s><s>We used the variable τ (tau) to refer to the prediction parameter for each subject.</s><s>The variable τ comes from the model and refers to a fit scalar variable, which is multiplied by future position (see the equations in Methods section "Behavioral Model").</s><s>In practice, it can be interpreted as the distance into the future that the subject prospects to guide his behavior (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>The variable τ can have positive, negative, or zero values.</s><s>A positive value for τ indicates that the subject points towards the expected future position of the prey -that is, the strategy reflects prediction.</s><s>A zero τ indicates that the subject points the joystick directly at the current position of the prey.</s><s>A negative value for τ indicates that the subject points the joystick towards where the prey was in the recent past.</s><s>Note that all of these strategies (within limits) are capable of eventually catching all prey, since the subject's avatar is, by design, faster than the prey.</s><s>The scalar parameter κ (kappa) reflects the amount of force applied toward the direction of the predicted position.</s><s>Thus, a negative value indicates that force is exerted away from (180 degrees opposite) the prey's position, whereas a positive value indicates that force is exerted towards it.</s></p><p><s>We also added an inertia term to the model.</s><s>Specifically, we computed an inertially biased path for each 16.67 ms frame.</s><s>The biased path is a vector sum of the computed best predicted direction and the previous direction (P subject (t) -P subject (t-1)).</s><s>In our implementation, these two terms have equal weighting.</s><s>Note that in practice, their relative weighting may nonetheless vary because the force term (κ, which is fit in the model), affects the weight of the new direction relative to the past direction.</s><s>This approach for implementing inertia is designed to align intuitively with how inertia works (see Methods, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, and Supplementary 4).</s></p><p><s>We called our first model the physics variable based prediction model (PVBP).</s><s>It assumes that subjects' prediction derives from the prey's current position, velocity (i.e. both speed and direction), and acceleration (which includes both direction and magnitude of acceleration), as well as further derivatives, see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>For all three subjects, the best fitting τ is positive, indicating that they point the joystick towards the prey's future position.</s><s>For ease of interpretation, we translated τ into time units by calculating the distance between the current position and estimated position, then divided that quantity by the average velocity of the prey across the session.</s><s>The results of this calculation indicate that subjects K, H and C pointed the joystick towards the position that the prey would occupy in an average of 800 ms, 767 ms, and 733 ms in the future, respectively.</s><s>In the context of the task, these numbers are substantial: they reflect 18.78%, 14.42%, and 13.23% of the average trial duration for K, H, and C, respectively.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether the positive prediction parameter τ is significantly greater than zero, we performed a bootstrap (randomization test making use of resampling with replacement) of heatmap slices from each segment (individual heatmap from 500 segments).</s><s>This resampling was performed 500 times and resulting heatmaps were added.</s><s>Then the τ and κ that best explain each segment (that is, the one resulting in the lowest cost) were selected in each resampling.</s><s>We confirmed that the estimated value τ and κ are both greater than zero more than 99% of the time (i.e., p&lt;0.01).</s></p><p><s>The distance into the future that our subjects predicted did not detectably depend on the speed of the prey (linear regression between reward/speed and mean τ, K: β=3.0316, p=0.1110;</s><s>H: β=4.5798, p=0.1791;</s><s>C: β=7.1007, p=0.0957; the term β refers to the regression coefficient for speed against neural activity).</s><s>We next asked whether taking more complex paths (ones with more turns vs. more straight paths) affected prediction span.</s><s>Prey path complexity (as measured by path curvature estimated by average angle method) affected prediction.</s><s>Specifically, subjects predicted less far into the future when the prey path had more curves (K: β=-0.0687;</s><s>H: β=-0.0567;</s><s>C: β=-0.0898,</s><s>p&lt;0.0001 for each).</s><s>Thus, subjects had the ability to dynamically adjust their own prediction in light of changing circumstances.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative models do not predict trajectories as well as physics-based prediction</head><p><s>We next compared the physics-based model to two other models implementing different prediction algorithms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>First, the veridical prediction (VP) model assumes that the subjects will make perfect predictions that incorporate all game dynamics, including preys' repulsion from the walls and the subject's avatar.</s><s>This means that a subject that makes a veridical prediction takes into account the effect his own movements will have on the prey's strategy.</s><s>Second, the cost contour map prediction (CCMP) model is the same as VP but excludes repulsion from the avatar, meaning that the subject's prediction model for the prey would not take into account their own motion.</s><s>We compared the performance of each model by computing the sum of squares error between the prediction trajectory and the observed trajectories over all time bins.</s></p><p><s>Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we found that the PVBP fit better than the other two models in our well-trained subjects (K: 7.529×10 6 , for subject K, second best was VP: 7.542×10 6 ; H, PVBP: 8.923×10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> ; for subject H, second best was CMPP: 8.950×10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>We fit each segment with distinct τ and κ parameters, and we fit these same two parameters for each of our three models.</s><s>As a consequence, the comparison of models can be done directly without concern of potential bias toward any specific model.</s><s>In other words, by fitting each of the three models subject to identical constraints, we ensured a fair comparison across models.</s><s>For the less well-trained subject, C, the CCMP model explained trajectories most accurately (7.955×10 6 ).</s></p><p><s>We speculated that one factor that may influence strategy is the speed of the prey.</s><s>Indeed, we found that all three subjects used PVBP more frequently when the speed of the prey was faster (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Note that this observed link between speed and the fit of the PVBP occurs even in our third (less fully trained) subject (p &lt; 0.001, logistic regression, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>In any case, our model's classification of strategies appears to be robust: the same results were obtained using a different method.</s><s>Specifically, we fit all individual segments to the best model and computed the model that fits the most overall number of segments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref> and Methods).</s></p><p><s>Doing the fitting this way may seem excessively flexible.</s><s>That is, using two times the number of segments might allow us to fit only noise.</s><s>(Consider, for example, the case of fitting 9 data points with 9th-order polynomial curve).</s><s>On the other hand, the extra freedom may allow us to better fit signal -or, of course, it may fit both noise and signal.</s><s>The key question, then, is whether using a large number of parameters makes the fit better despite the possibility of fitting noise.</s><s>To answer this question, we directly compared the two approaches (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, we compared a model assigning two parameters globally versus one applying two parameters for each one-second segment (i.e., Monkey K: 28,164; Monkey H: 35,308; Monkey C: 20,720 parameters, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>We then used AIC to compare models.</s><s>We found that the second-by-second fitting resulted in lower AIC values, implying a better fit, than the 2-parameter counterpart.</s><s>Specifically, in this figure, for all individual subjects, the change in AIC (AIC for global parameter model minus AIC for second-by-second model) was positive -implying the model fit by second-by-second model explains the data better than the counterpart -for the best physics-based model explaining the subject's behavior.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the model comparison results showed that subjects predict the upcoming position of the prey using Newtonian physics but ignore the walls and their own influence on the prey.</s><s>That is, subjects use a simplified approximation of the structure of the game to make future predictions; presumably this simplified one is sufficient to generate good predictions with lower mental effort costs.</s><s>Indeed, the correlation between speed of prey and subjects' reliance on physics based prediction (a result confirmed with two different analytical approaches) suggests that prediction might have a computational cost.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prediction-related information encoded in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex</head><p><s>Based on its role as a nexus for motivational, cognitive, and motor information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , and its demonstrated role in human prospection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , we hypothesized that dACC would be critical for predictive pursuit (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>We fit a statistically unbiased Linear-Nonlinear Generalized Linear Model (GLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> ) to responses of 150 well-isolated dACC neurons (K: n=31; H: n=119).</s><s>For this analysis, we focused on the entire trial period rather than preselecting epochs.</s></p><p><s>Position, velocity, and acceleration of the prey were all encoded by significant proportions of neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; position: 62.00%, n=93/150; speed: 35.33%, n=53/150; 36.67%;</s><s>direction: n=55/150, acceleration: 24.67%, n=37/150, p&lt;0.001 in all cases, two-way binomial test).</s><s>The model fit shown in magenta is the shape of reconstructed filter (examples, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>According to the GLM, jerk, the derivative of acceleration, is not encoded (see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Jerk also did not measurably affect the subject's neural responses (it only modulated 2.00% of cells, n=3/150, p=0.1288, two-way binomial test).</s><s>Together, these results indicate that dACC ensembles carry the major raw ingredients that our subjects use to predict prey positions.</s></p><p><s>We wondered whether ostensible coding for prey variables could be the byproduct of coding for self-position, since self-position and prey position do tend to be somewhat correlated.</s><s>We therefore repeated our GLM analyses but included self-position, self-direction, and selfspeed as explanatory factors and considered variance explained by prey parameters only after accounting for these variables.</s><s>Doing this, the proportion of neurons selective for the prey's position information remained significant (n=108/167, 64.50%; p &lt; 0.001, two-way binomial test), as did neurons selective for prey speed (n=31/167, 22.16%; p&lt;0.001, twoway binomial test), and direction (n=20/167, 11.98%, p &lt; 0.001, two-way binomial test).</s><s>Note, for this analysis, we included a small subset of neurons, n=17, that were excluded from the previous analysis.</s><s>Results do not differ if we use the same slightly smaller set of neurons.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neurons in dACC encode future position</head><p><s>We next asked whether dACC neurons encode the future position of the prey.</s><s>For each neuron, we refit the GLM using an additional parameter, the position of the prey at time t in the future.</s><s>We selected the time t (t=833ms) that was most similar to the value of τ resulting from our generative model, that is, the one indicating the most likely time span of prediction (733, 766, and 800 for the three subjects, respectively) subject to the additional constraint of being a multiple of 166.67 (i.e. 10 frames).</s><s>Note that although this value was chosen in advance, it aligns with the empirically derived measure of peak future position coding (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>, see below).</s></p><p><s>Our analysis approach deals with the problem of correlation between the set of current Newtonian variables (including current position) and future position by assigning all explanatory power to the set of current variables first, and only counting as significant any additional variance explained by future position (see Methods).</s><s>Despite this conservative criterion, we found that responses of 24.67% of dACC neurons are selective for the prey's future position at time t (n=37/150).</s></p><p><s>Visual inspection of the neurons' filters shows that their selectivity is complex (examples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>That is, they are positionally tuned, but, unlike place cells, have nonpoint-like shapes.</s><s>They contain multiple peaks.</s><s>They do not appear to be smooth gradients.</s><s>Instead, they appeared to be heterogeneously spatially tuned.</s><s>In this manner, they resemble recently identified non-grid-like space-selective cells in entorhinal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Notably, conventional methods for detecting place/grid-like cells will greatly underestimate the proportion of such tuning.</s></p><p><s>We next asked how strongly dACC neurons encode the future position of the prey.</s><s>We calculated the proportion of log likelihood increase (LLi) between the current position model and the current plus future model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Our neurons showed a wide range of marginal variance explained.</s><s>On average, adding the future position term improved variance explained by 6.89% (the mean of this proportion is significantly different from zero, p&lt;0.001,</s><s>Wilcoxon sign-rank test, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A inset</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We then asked whether these newly discovered future position cells constitute a separate class of neurons from the cells that tracked the current position of the prey.</s><s>To do this, we computed the explanatory variance accounted for by future position (variance explained by the combined model minus variance explained by current position) and current position, as defined by log likelihood improvement (LLi) in fitting.</s><s>We found a positive correlation between these variables (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>), indicating current and future position were multiplexed in the same population of cells (r = 0.7394, p &lt;
