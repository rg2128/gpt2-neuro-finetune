<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>These results show that L2/3 excitatory neurons are excited by both classical and inverse stimuli centered on their ffRF.</s><s>Classical and inverse stimuli were mutually antagonistic because the responses to both stimuli together (e.g.</s><s>full-field gratings) were smaller than the responses to either of the stimuli alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref>).</s><s>We defined a neuron as inverse tuned if its response to at least one inverse stimulus of any size centered on its ffRF was larger than that to a full-field stimulus (see Methods).</s><s>Of the visually responsive excitatory neurons in L2/3, 79% were inverse tuned (943 of 1190 neurons in 9 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a-c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a</ref>).</s><s>We computed the inverse tuning index (ITI; 0.5: equal responses to classical and inverse stimuli of preferred size; 0: classical only; 1: inverse only; see Methods).</s><s>The ITI distribution of L2/3 excitatory neurons was unimodal peaking at 0.52 ± 0.01 (mean ± SEM; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Inverse-tuned neurons have a region surrounding their ffRF that is either suppressive or excitatory depending on whether it is stimulated in the presence or absence of a stimulus in the ffRF, respectively.</s><s>We used classical and inverse stimuli to compare the tuning properties of the surrounding excitatory region with those of the ffRF.</s><s>On average, the orientation tuning to inverse stimuli was sharper than that to classical stimuli (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b-f</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, individual neurons were not necessarily tuned to the same orientation when stimulated by classical or inverse stimuli (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3g</ref>).</s><s>We determined the interaction between the surrounding region and the ffRF in neurons with similar orientation preference by varying the contrast of classical or inverse stimuli presented simultaneously.</s><s>With matching contrasts above 13% the interaction between the surrounding region and the ffRF was antagonistic (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Is inverse tuning in L2/3 inherited from earlier stages of cortical processing?</s><s>We measured the responses of excitatory neurons in layer 4 (L4) to classical and inverse stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1d-f</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3i</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to L2/3 neurons, the suppressive regions of L4 neurons surrounded their ffRF, creating a ring around the center (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1e</ref>; the absence of a suppressive ring around the ffRF of L2/3 neurons was not due to insufficient spatial resolution of the mapping stimuli; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>).</s><s>Further, the responses of L4 neurons to inverse stimuli placed on the ffRF center decreased monotonically with stimulus size, consistent with the progressive reduction of feedforward drive (Extended Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>) and, again, different from L2/3 neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref> vs Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1f</ref>).</s><s>Overall, the spatial organization of suppressive regions of L4 neurons was consistent with previous models and observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and distinct from L2/3 neurons.</s><s>Thus, inverse tuning in L2/3 excitatory neurons is not inherited from L4 neurons.</s></p><p><s>Sources of input to L2/3 neurons are neuron-type specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Is inverse tuning also present in L2/3 inhibitory neurons?</s><s>We characterized the responses of the three major classes of cortical inhibitory neurons, PV, VIP and SOM neurons to classical and inverse stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3j-l</ref>).</s><s>Both PV and VIP neurons showed surround suppression to classical stimuli, consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, both PV and VIP neurons responded to inverse stimuli centered on their ffRF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) and showed sizetuning functions to inverse stimuli that peaked well above their response to the largest classical stimuli.</s><s>In contrast, SOM neurons only showed little surround suppression to classical stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , poor and spatially diffuse responses to inverse stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2d</ref>), and no responses to inverse stimuli above the response to the largest classical stimuli.</s><s>Thus, like L2/3 excitatory neurons, most PV and VIP neurons were inverse tuned, while SOM neurons were not (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Although L2/3 neurons do not directly inherit inverse tuning from L4, the excitatory region surrounding their ffRF could still be generated via feedforward inputs from L4 neurons with spatially offset ffRFs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a</ref>).</s><s>Alternatively, the excitatory region surrounding L2/3 neurons' ffRFs could be generated via feedback projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>We thus compared the latency of the responses of inverse-tuned neurons to classical and inverse stimuli using extracellular electrophysiological recordings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a</ref>) and isolated single units throughout cortical layers, including infragranular layers (L5/6).</s><s>A large fraction of infragranular units were also inverse tuned (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>).</s><s>In inverse-tuned units recorded in both supra-and infragranular layers the time course of the responses to classical and inverse stimuli were markedly different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b</ref>).</s><s>While the response to classical stimuli showed a fast initial transient followed by a plateau, the response to inverse stimuli slowly progressed towards steady state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3c-e</ref>) and was delayed relative to the classical response (50 ± 20 ms; mean ± SEM; 15 units; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3f</ref>).</s><s>The same biases were observed when comparing the response dynamics to classical stimuli in all responsive neurons to those to inverse stimuli in inverse-tuned neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3g</ref>).</s><s>The difference in latencies and the slower dynamics of responses to inverse stimuli suggest that the excitatory region surrounding L2/3 neurons' ffRF is unlikely to emerge from the feedforward pathway.</s></p><p><s>Could the responses to inverse stimuli depend on feedback projections from higher visual areas (HVAs)?</s><s>The impact of anesthesia on sensory responses has been hypothesized to be stronger in HVAs than in V1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>We thus compared the impact of isoflurane on the responses to classical stimuli in V1 and HVAs identified beforehand using wide-field intrinsic imaging (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a-c</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, anesthesia suppressed responses more in HVAs than in V1 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6d-f</ref>).</s><s>If responses of L2/3 neurons to inverse stimuli rely on feedback projections, they should be more sensitive to anesthesia than responses to classical stimuli.</s><s>Indeed, in inverse-tuned neurons, anesthesia preferentially suppressed responses to inverse stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>), suggesting that the response to inverse stimuli may be driven by feedback projections from HVAs.</s></p><p><s>To directly test the involvement of feedback projections on inverse tuning, we silenced HVAs by scanning them with a laser to optogenetically activate inhibitory neurons, while recording extracellular electrophysiological activity in V1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5a</ref>-e and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-c</ref>).</s><s>In inverse-tuned units, silencing HVAs reduced both spontaneous activity and responses to small diameter classical stimuli.</s><s>In surround-suppressed units, silencing HVAs increased responses to large diameter classical stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5b-d</ref>;

Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10a-h</ref>).</s><s>LM boutons whose RFs were centered on the retinotopic coordinates of the imaged V1 site, showed surround suppression to classical stimuli and were not inverse tuned (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5g</ref>).</s><s>When presenting inverse stimuli centered on the RF of the LM boutons, the response decreased with increasing diameter of the gray patch, as in L4 neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1f</ref>).</s><s>This was not a general property of LM neurons since directly imaging cell bodies in LM showed inverse tuning in some neurons, and in the population average (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10i-k</ref>).</s><s>Thus, V1 neurons do not directly inherit inverse tuning from LM.</s></p><p><s>Inverse tuning of L2/3 neurons could result from LM inputs which, while per se not inverse tuned, have spatially offset RFs relative to those of L2/3 neurons.</s><s>These LM inputs would respond to an inverse stimulus centered on the V1 retinotopic coordinates because their RF, being offset relative to the gray patch, would be stimulated by the grating.</s><s>We mapped the spatial offset of the RF of LM boutons relative to the retinotopic coordinates of the V1 sites.</s><s>The RF centers of LM boutons showed a wide scatter relative to the retinotopic coordinates of the V1 site, larger than the scatter of ffRF centers of L2/3 neurons at the V1 site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5h</ref>; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>), consistent with a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Thus, LM boutons with spatially offset RF centers converge on a given retinotopic site in V1.</s><s>If these LM inputs contribute to the inverse response of L2/3 neurons, they should respond to inverse stimuli centered on the V1 site.</s><s>This was indeed the case on average and a large fraction of these boutons significantly responded to inverse stimuli (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10h</ref>) with a preference for small sizes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5i</ref>), consistent with the inverse size-tuning function in L2/3 neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the response of these boutons to progressively larger classical stimuli centered on the V1 site increased gradually (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5i</ref>), consistent with their RFs being offset relative to the center of the stimulus.</s><s>Thus, inverse tuning in L2/3 V1 neurons likely results from the feedback of non-inverse-tuned neurons in HVAs whose RFs are offset relative to the ffRF centers of the V1 neurons they converge on.</s></p><p><s>Our results demonstrate that feedback projections to V1 neurons generate a second, distinct excitatory RF that surrounds the ffRF.</s><s>This feedback RF (fbRF) is absent in L4 and emerges along the laminar processing hierarchy in the supra-and infragranular layers of V1.</s><s>The fbRF and the ffRF are mutually antagonistic such that neurons respond when a stimulus is presented in either the fbRF or ffRF but not in both together, effectively performing an exclusive-OR operation.</s><s>Suppression of responses to stimuli in the ffRF by surrounding stimuli is a well-established phenomenon that enables neurons to report differences in stimulus features between the excited region inside the ffRF and its surround <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> .</s><s>Neurons with an excitatory fbRF report differences in stimulus features regardless of whether the excited region is located inside or outside the ffRF.</s><s>We hypothesize that SOM inhibitory neurons, which, in contrast to PV and VIP neurons, respond poorly to inverse stimuli while robustly responding to large stimuli covering both fbRFs and ffRFs, could mediate the mutual antagonism consistent with their role in surround suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition to HVAs, local excitation within V1 may also contribute to the generation of the fbRF <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Regardless, the fbRF may underlie phenomena such as filling-in or illusory contours in which the stimulus in the ffRF is absent, weak or obstructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and may account for contextual modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , detection of borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> or pop-out effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The antagonism between ffRF and fbRF is reminiscent of models of predictive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> in which bottom-up information about the stimulus is compared with topdown predictions, such that only differences between prediction and stimulus identity are represented.</s><s>Surround suppression has been interpreted within this framework because if the visual stimulus surrounding the ffRF predicts the stimulus in the ffRF there is no difference between prediction and stimulus identity and, therefore, the response is suppressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>With inverse tuning, the framework of predictive processing generalizes to stimuli within and outside of the ffRF due to the presence of a fbRF.</s><s>Independent of any conceptual framework, the presence of a fbRF generated by feedback projections likely accounts for several aspects of sensory processing along the cortical hierarchy.</s></p></div>
