Ballard, 1999)</ref> proposes a hierarchical neural network architecture in which perception is accomplished via the interaction of top-down expectation and sensory-driven analysis.</s><s>Rather than passively responding to the output activity generated by preceding stages of cortical processing, PC proposes that higher levels of cortex actively predict the input they expect to receive.</s><s>Furthermore, it is proposed that cortical feedback connections convey predictions while cortical feedforward connections convey residual errors between these top-down predictions and the bottom-up input.</s><s>Hence, PC, in common with several previous theories (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barlow, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mumford, 1992)</ref>, hypothesises that cortical feedback connections act to suppress information which is predicted by higher-level cortical regions.</s><s>It has previously been noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hamker, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Koch and Poggio, 1999</ref>) that this role for cortical feedback appears to be inconsistent with physiological data showing that the effects of cortical feedback are predominately excitatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Johnson and Burkhalter, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shao and Burkhalter, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>In particular, the inhibitory cortical feedback proposed in the predictive coding model seems inconsistent with single-cell electrophysiological experiments exploring the effects of attention.</s><s>In such experiments, attention is manipulated by inducing an expectation about the location or features of a subsequently presented stimulus.</s><s>This has been shown to produce an increase in the amplitude of the neural activity generated in response to an attended (i.e., predicted) stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hupé et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kastner and Ungerleider, 2000;</ref><ref

between the predictions of PC and the empirical data it would be unexpected that PC could be used to simulate single-cell electrophysiological data associated with attention.</s><s>However, this article demonstrates that attention experiments can be simulated, very easily, using the PC model.</s></p><p><s>A neural network implementation of PC requires two populations of neurons to model each cortical region (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Firstly, a population of prediction nodes is required to provide top-down predictions to earlier processing stages.</s><s>Secondly, a population of error-detecting nodes is required to calculate the residual error between the top-down predictions and the bottom-up input.</s><s>Descriptions of PC tend to emphasise the importance of the error-detecting nodes, and hence stress the suppression of activity caused in these nodes by top-down predictions.</s><s>However, this emphasis is misleading as the prediction nodes, which are required to maintain an active representation of the (predicted) input, are equally important to the functioning of the model.</s><s>These prediction nodes are equivalent to the representational nodes employed in many biased competition (BC) models.</s><s>Indeed, it is shown in Section 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(and Spratling, 2008)</ref> that PC is mathematically equivalent to a particular form of BC model in which nodes compete via negative feedback <ref type="bibr">(Harpur and</ref><ref type="bibr">Prager, 1996, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Spratling and Johnson, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>It is for this reason that the responses generated by the prediction nodes in the PC model can be used to simulate attention data.</s></p><p><s>One limitation of the PC model is that it is purely linear.</s><s>A more computationally powerful model might include nonlinearities.</s><s>Hence, this article also proposes a nonlinear version of PC and demonstrates that this can more accurately simulate the effects of attention.</s><s>It is also shown to provide a theoretical explanation, consistent with previous theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Roelfsema, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Roelfsema et al., 2000)</ref>, for the role of attention in solving the binding problem. 1 2 Methods 2.1 Predictive Coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rao and Ballard (1999)</ref> implemented PC using a model in which the responses (y) of the prediction nodes (at a particular stage of the hierarchy, i.e., Si)

peripheral cortical or thalamic region that is not explicitly modelled), y td = W Si+1 T y Si+1 is the top-down prediction from the next highest stage, W Si = [w Si 1 , . . .</s><s>, w Si n ] T is an n by m matrix of synaptic weight values, each row of which contains the feedforward weights received by a single node, and ζ, η, and ϑ are constant scale factors.</s><s>Note that in certain simulations presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rao and Ballard (1999)</ref> a variation on the above algorithm was used which imposed additional constraints on the sparsity of the response.</s><s>This was achieved through a sigmoid nonlinearity applied to the term in square brackets and by using a different function of y Si following parameter ϑ.</s><s>The above equation has been derived using Euler's method to convert the differential equation actually proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rao and Ballard (1999)</ref> into a discrete time form suitable for numerical simulation.</s><s>The dynamics of the original differential equation can be approximated to different degrees of precision by scaling parameters ζ, η, and ϑ to effectively modify the time step

activations.</s></p><p><s>An illustration of a hierarchical neural network implementation of equations 2 and 3 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>.</s><s>Only a simple, two stage, hierarchy is shown for clarity, but a practical model would include a convergence of connections from nodes with smaller non-overlapping receptive fields (RFs) in lower levels in order to provide nodes in higher levels with larger RFs.</s><s>The neural implementation of the PC model employed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rao and Ballard (1999)</ref> was more complicated than that shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>.</s><s>In their implementation each cortical region contained four separate populations of neurons.</s><s>However, the network shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> is equivalent to their model and retains its essential features such as excitatory feedforward connections, and inhibitory feedback connections, between different cortical regions, and feedforward excitation and feedback inhibition between the y and e populations within each cortical region.</s><s>This network is also very similar to the architecture proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Friston (2005)</ref>.</s></p></div>

ζW Si e Si-1 -ηy Si + η W Si+1 T y Si+1 Furthermore, the different populations of error-detecting nodes can be re-labelled (by adding 1 to the processing stage each e population is assigned to) without having any effect on functionality, such that: e Si = y Si-1 -W Si T y Si (4)  <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rao and Ballard (1999)</ref>.</s><s>(b) The predictive coding model reformulated as a form of biased competition model.</s><s>Rectangles represent populations of neurons, with y labelling populations of prediction nodes and e labelling populations of error-detecting neurons.</s><s>Open arrows signify excitatory connections, filled arrows indicate inhibitory connections, crossed connections signify a many-to-many connectivity pattern between nodes in two populations, parallel connections indicate a one-to-one mapping between the nodes in two populations, and large shaded boxes, with rounded corners, indicate the proposed mapping of the model onto different cortical areas or processing stages.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y Si ← (1 -η -ϑ)y Si + ζW Si e Si + η W Si+1 T y Si+1<label>(5)</label></formula><p><s>A neural network implementing equations 4 and 5 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>.</s><s>The substitution of e Si into the equation for y Si has the effect of modifying the mechanism used to enable the activity in one population of y units to enhance the activity of nodes in the preceding population of y units.</s><s>The original model employed a two stage inhibitory feedback pathway (via the e neurons) from the y population in one stage to that in the preceding stage.</s><s>In contrast, the reformulated model produces a mathematically identical result using direct excitatory feedback from one population of prediction nodes to the preceding one.</s><s>The re-labelling of the error-detecting nodes has the effect of shifting the assignment of neural populations to processing stages and hence changes the proposed mapping of the algorithm onto cortical regions (as illustrated by the large shaded boxes, with rounded corners, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The original PC network (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) requires feedback from one cortical area to the preceding area to be predominantly inhibitory whereas the reformulated PC architecture (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) predicts that the effects of cortical feedback are predominately excitatory.</s><s>The latter is more consistent with cortical physiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Johnson and Burkhalter, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shao and Burkhalter, 1996)</ref> and hence the reformulated model proposes the more biologically plausible neural architecture.</s></p><p><s>Up to this point the model is mathematically identical to the linear model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rao and Ballard (1999)</ref>: equations 4 and 5 are simply equation 1 re-written in a different form.</s><s>However, in its current form this model only allows for a straight chain of processing stages, so that each stage receives feedforward input from one preceding stage and feedback from a single subsequent stage.</s><s>To generalise the model so as to allow more complex hierarchies to be simulated, it is necessary to allow a processing stage to receive inputs from multiple sources.</s><s>To allow multiple sources of feedforward input, it is simply necessary to replace y Si-1 in equation 4 with a column vector made of a concatenation of all the feedforward inputs to processing stage Si.</s><s>These inputs sources could be vectors of node activations calculated at lower-levels in the hierarchy and/or arrays of external inputs.</s></p><p><s>To allow multiple sources of feedback, equation 5 needs to be modified.</s><s>In equation 5, feedback excitation received from each individual node in the subsequent stage in the hierarchy is summed to determine the overall top-down excitation received by a prediction node.</s><s>Hence, feedback from all other possible sources should be treated in exactly the same way (i.e., summed), so that:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y Si ← (1 -η -ϑ)y Si + ζW Si e Si + η W Si+1 T y Si+1 + W Sz T y Sz + . . .</formula><p><s>Where the term in square brackets is simply the sum of the feedback received from each separate source of top-down excitation.</s><s>These feedback signals can originate from node activations calculated at higher-levels in the hierarchy and/or external inputs.</s></p><p><s>To include attention in the model, it is assumed that attentional feedback is treated exactly the same as feedback from higher stages in the hierarchy.</s><s>Only one source of additional feedback to each modelled cortical region is assumed.</s><s>Specifically, a processing stage (Si) receives attentional feedback from a population of nodes with activations y Ai via a set of feedback weights W Ai T .</s><s>These attentional signals are assumed to arise from circuitry not explicitly modelled here.</s><s>For convenience, the above equation for y Si is split into two separate equations, the first (equation 7) describing how prediction node activations change with bottom-up stimulation and the second equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) describing the top-down influences on the prediction node activations.</s><s>This results in a final description of the linear model as follows:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_5">e Si = y Si-1 -W Si T y Si (6) y Si ← (1 -η -ϑ)y Si + ζW Si e Si (7) y Si ← y Si + η W Si+1 T y Si+1 + W Ai T y Ai (8)</formula><p><s>The hierarchical neural network architecture that would implement equations 6, 7 and 8 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</s><s>This reformulated model can be interpreted as a form of BC model in which cortical regions at neighbouring stages along an information processing pathway are reciprocally connected by excitatory feedforward and feedback connections, and neurons (the y population) within each population compete to be active.</s><s>The outcome of this competition will be influenced by both the bottom-up stimulation received from earlier processing stages and the top-down activation received from higher-levels (including sources of attention).</s><s>The type of competition used in this reformulated predictive coding model is very similar to that proposed by <ref type="bibr">Harpur and</ref><ref type="bibr">Prager (1996, 1994)</ref>, in which neurons within a region compete via a form of lateral inhibition in which nodes suppress the inputs (rather than the outputs) of other nodes.</s><s>Specifically, activation from the prediction nodes is fed-back to subtractively inhibit the inputs to those nodes.</s><s>This calculation of the inhibited input activities is performed in a separate neural population of error-detecting nodes.</s><s>A similar mechanism of inhibition, in which nodes suppress the inputs to neighbouring nodes, has previously been used to successfully implement a BC model <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Spratling and Johnson, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>However in this previous model, the inhibition was proposed to take place within the dendrites of the output neurons rather than within a separate, error-detecting, neural population.</s></p><p><s>The model described by equations 6, 7 and 8 is mathematically identical to the linear PC model described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rao and Ballard (1999)</ref> with a minor modification to allow external sources of attention to influence prediction node activities.</s><s>As discussed in the preceding paragraph, this model can also be interpreted as a form of BC.</s><s>It will, therefore, be referred to as the linear PC/BC model.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Introducing Nonlinearities</head><p><s>Up to this point the model is purely linear.</s><s>In this section two changes to the model will be proposed, both of which introduce nonlinearities.</s><s>The first modification is to change the mechanism of competition used by replacing equations 6 and 7 with:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_6">e Si = y Si-1 + ŴSi T y Si (9) y Si ← + y Si ⊗ W Si e Si (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p><s>Where W Si is a matrix of synaptic weight values normalised such that the sum of each row (i.e., the total weight received by each node) is equal to one.</s><s>ŴSi is a matrix representing the same synaptic weight values as W but such that the rows are normalised to have a maximum value of one.</s><s>The parameter is a small constant (i.e., 1 × 10 -10 ) that prevents division-by-zero errors in the calculation of e and allows the values of y to increase from an initial value of zero, and and ⊗ indicate element-wise division and multiplication respectively.</s><s>The mechanism used in the linear PC/BC model applies subtractive inhibition to the inputs of the prediction nodes.</s><s>The proposed method employs a mechanism of competition in which nodes divisively modulate their inputs.</s><s>This is described as 'divisive modulation' of the inputs, rather than divisive inhibition, as the values of e generated by equation 9 will often be larger than the corresponding x value: the divisor of the division is not guaranteed to be larger than the dividend, and hence the inputs to the prediction nodes could be magnified as well as inhibited.</s><s>This method is similar to an on-line version of the activation update rule used in the non-negative matrix factorisation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lee and Seung, 1999)</ref> and has been shown to generate more accurate parsings of images into their elementary components than the subtractive feedback mechanism used in the linear model Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: A simple, two stage, processing hierarchy used in the simulations reported in this article.</s><s>The symbols used are the same as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Spratling et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>An additional advantage of this mechanism is that the values of e and y are inherently bounded to be non-negative.</s><s>In contrast, in the linear PC/BC model both error-detecting and prediction nodes are required to be able to signal both positive and negative values.</s><s>Since biological neurons have firing rates that can never be negative the proposed nonlinear mechanism of competition overcomes a biological implausibility of the linear model.</s><s>The second modification is to allow excitatory feedback from one processing stage to the preceding stage to be modulatory rather than additive; i.e., to replace equation 8 with:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_8">y Si ← y Si ⊗ 1 + η W Si+1 T y Si+1 + W Ai T y Ai<label>(11)</label></formula><p><s>Cortical feedback has been observed to multiplicatively modulate the bottom-up driven activation of lowerlevel neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andersen et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brotchie et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Motter, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Treue, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Williford and Maunsell, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>While these modulatory effects might be brought about by the interplay between linear mechanisms of excitation and inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004)</ref>, several physiological mechanisms have been identified that could allow cortical feedback to have a direct modulatory effect on neural responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Friston, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Larkum et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Spruston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sripati and Johnson, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Consideration of computational requirements have also lead to arguments in favour of cortical feedback being modulatory, rather than additive <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Crick and Koch, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Grossberg and Raizada, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Roelfsema, 2006)</ref>, for example, in order to avoid top-down expectation producing strong responses to stimuli for which there is no supporting evidence (i.e., to prevent the "hallucination" of image features that are not present).</s></p><p><s>The model described by equations 9, 10 and 11 will be referred to as the nonlinear PC/BC model.</s><s>This model can also be implemented using the neural architecture shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</s></p></div>

seem to be superficially consistent with behaviour, but no actual psychophysical or neurophysiological data was simulated.</s></p><p><s>This article has shown that predictive coding can be construed as a form of biased competition model.</s><s>Hence, one interpretation of the PC/BC model is that neurons (prediction nodes) compete to be active and the outcome of this competition is influenced not only by bottom-up, sensory-driven, processes but also by top-down, attentiondependent, biases.</s><s>Many other neural network models of attention are based on the same principles of biased competition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Corchs and Deco, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deco et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hamker, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr"

1996)</ref>.</s><s>The principal difference between the PC/BC model and previous biased competition models is the mechanism used to perform the competition.</s><s>In previous models, neurons within a cortical region compete to generate outputs.</s><s>In the PC/BC model, neurons compete to receive inputs.</s><s>The former mechanism can be implemented using a form of lateral inhibition that targets node outputs whereas the latter mechanism is implemented using inhibition that targets the inputs to a population of competing nodes.</s><s>Competition for inputs was the main mechanism through which both the linear and nonlinear PC/BC models succeeded in simulating the suppressive effects of a poor stimulus when the selectivity of the recorded node varied (Section 3.1.2).</s><s>It would therefore be interesting to know if other biased competition models, employing the standard mechanisms of competition, could also simulate this data.</s></p><p><s>A second difference between previous implementations of biased competition and the nonlinear PC/BC model is the mechanism used to provide the top-down bias.</s><s>In most previous models (and in the linear PC/BC model), cortical feedback connections are considered to have an additive effect, whereas in the nonlinear PC/BC model cortical feedback has a multiplicative effect.</s><s>The multiplicative response modulation employed in the nonlinear PC/BC model enabled it to simulate a much wider range of data than the linear PC/BC model (see discussion above).</s><s>Hence, it seems likely that the nonlinear PC/BC model will have a similar advantage over other biased competition models that employ additive feedback.</s></p><p><s>An influential class of models of visual attention are based on the concept of a saliency map (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Heinke and Humphreys, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Heinke et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Itti and Koch, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr"

1994)</ref>.</s><s>In such models, saliency values for each spatial location are calculated.</s><s>The calculation of saliency may be purely stimulus-driven or may also be affected by top-down biases.</s><s>Competition occurs such that the location with the highest salience is chosen as the focus of attention.</s><s>Hence, in common with biased competition models (including the PC/BC model), saliency map models also perform competition and the outcome of this competition may be influenced by both bottom-up and top-down factors.</s><s>However, saliency map models differ from biased competition models (including the PC/BC model) in three significant ways.</s><s>Firstly, rather than postulating a single map where ultimately the competition is resolved, biased competition models propose that competition is performed across a distributed network of interacting cortical regions.</s><s>Secondly, saliency map models split perceptual processing into two temporally separate stages: the saliency map is used to select the focus of attention and information at this selected location is subsequently sent for further processing (e.g., object recognition).</s><s>In contrast, the neural activity that is generated following competition in the biased competition model is itself a representation of the stimulus.</s><s>The biased competition model thus resolves the dichotomy between early <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Broadbent, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Treisman, 1969)</ref> and late <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deutsch and Deutsch, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Shiffrin and Schneider, 1977)</ref> selection theories of attention by challenging the traditional view (which is implicit to saliency map models) that there are distinct pre-attentive and attentive stages in perceptual processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Broadbent, 1958)</ref>.</s><s>The third distinction between saliency map models and biased competition models is that the former employs distinct mechanisms (i.e., separate pathways) for dealing with saliency and featural information (i.e., these two forms of information are not only dealt with at different times, but also using different neural hardware).</s><s>In contrast, in the biased competition model, saliency is related to activation strength while featural (and spatial) information is related to the identity of the neuron (i.e., place coding) so both types of information can be manipulated independently within a single neural system.</s></p><p><s>In the nonlinear PC/BC model, when the strength of the top-down, attentional, signal varies across a population of neurons, this can lead to both response enhancement and suppression in different subsets of prediction nodes (e.g., Section 3.2.2).</s><s>Enhanced activity is a direct effect of attention: resulting from the response gain in nodes that receive strong top-down input.</s><s>Suppressed activity is an indirect effect of attention mediated by the competition between the prediction nodes: increased activity in some nodes results in stronger inhibition and hence more suppression in other nodes.</s><s>In contrast, the "feature similarity gain model" <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Treue and Martinez-Trujillo, 1999)</ref> proposes that both enhanced and reduced responses are a direct effect of attention which can change the response gain of a cell (both up and down) in proportion to the similarity between the attended stimulus and the preferred stimulus of the neuron.</s><s>The proposed model, in common with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ardid et al. (2007)</ref>, generates the same effect via biased competition.</s><s>An alternative model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boynton, 2005)</ref> employs both competition between nodes and direct suppressive and excitatory effects of attention.</s></p><p><s>When attention results in the response modulation of a subset of the inputs to a recorded neuron, both the linear and nonlinear PC/BC models generate responses that are more similar to those that would have been produced if the attended inputs had been presented in isolation (e.g., Section 3.1.1).</s><s>These effects when observed in electrophysiological data have been described in terms of a shrinkage of the RF around the attended stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Connor et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Moran and Desimone, 1985)</ref>.</s><s>However, rather than any change in the RF properties of the recorded neuron, the model proposes, as have others before <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Connor et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Maunsell and McAdams, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Womelsdorf et al., 2006)</ref>, that the apparent RF distortion arises from a change in the pattern of feedforward stimulation received by the cell, coupled with the effect modulating the afferent input has on the competition occurring between cells.</s></p><p><s>The selective enhancement of certain neural responses over others is central to several other models.</s><s>These models differ from nonlinear PC/BC in not specifying a mechanism, or proposing a different mechanism, to bring about selective response enhancement.</s><s>Also, the role of response enhancement has been described in different ways: as a mechanism for preferentially routing information through the cortical hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Olshausen et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tsotsos et al., 1995)</ref>, as a means of performing coordinate transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Salinas and Abbott, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Salinas and Thier, 2000)</ref>, as a method of binding and image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Roelfsema, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Roelfsema et al., 2000)</ref>, or as a mechanism for probabilistically combining prior knowledge with current evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Friston, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee and Mumford, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rao, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>The behaviour of the nonlinear PC/BC model might be described in the same terms.</s><s>There are, therefore, other alternative perspectives on the PC/BC model in addition to the perspectives of predictive coding and biased competition which have been the focus of this article.</s></p></div>
