<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dopamine axons in TS encode external stimulus intensity but not value</head><p><s>Previous studies of projection-specified populations have not examined the covariation of dopamine activity with value or salience, which are fundamental characteristics for evaluating the function of each population.</s><s>To better understand the nature of dopamine signals in the striatum, we first characterized the activity of dopamine axons by presenting an array of stimuli to head-fixed mice.</s><s>We monitored the activity of dopamine axons at their projection targets using fiber fluorometry/photometry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s>To mask any potential responses related to the auditory detection of non-auditory stimuli (e.g.</s><s>water delivery), training and experiments were performed with constant background noise (see Methods).</s></p><p><s>We first examined the co-variation of dopamine axon activity in VS or TS with outcome value.</s><s>Consistent with previous results <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , dopamine axons in VS responded strongly to water but only weakly to a neutral tone, whereas dopamine axons in TS responded strongly to tones and air puffs but only weakly to water.</s><s>The activity of dopamine axons in VS scaled with the size of the reward (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>), consistent with the idea that dopamine signals encode reward value in this area.</s><s>Surprisingly, responses of dopamine axons in TS to water delivery were not significantly modulated by reward size (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>), indicating that the small responses to water observed here and in previous studies are potentially caused by primitive sensory information such as the water valve click rather than reward value.</s><s>Unlike dopamine axons in VS, the responses in TS scaled with the intensity of the tone (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>) or air puff (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because high intensity external stimuli (such as tones or air puffs) are potentially aversive, we next examined whether dopamine axons in TS respond to all events with negative value.</s></p><p><s>We found that, whereas dopamine axon signals in VS were inhibited by every negative stimulus that we tested (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>), dopamine axons in TS did not respond to some types of negative stimuli such as bitter taste (quinine) or the omission of expected water (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Instead, dopamine axons in TS were strongly activated by high intensity stimuli of multiple modalities including somatosensory, auditory, visual, and olfactory stimuli (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Further, consistent with a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , dopamine axon responses in TS scaled with the novelty of each stimulus, and the signals decayed differently depending on the stimulus intensity and type (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Together, these data demonstrate that dopamine axons in TS do not respond to all forms of reward and/or punishment, indicating that they do not simply encode positive and/or negative value <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Instead, these data indicate that dopamine axons in TS respond specifically to novel or high intensity external stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Because dopamine signals are potentially modulated at axon terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , we also recorded activity at the cell bodies of midbrain dopamine neurons.</s><s>To target TS-projecting dopamine neurons, we first examined their distribution within the midbrain by retrogradely infecting their axons in TS with rabies virus expressing GFP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>We found that TS-projecting dopamine neurons are concentrated in the lateral part of substantia nigra (SN) especially the most lateral part, called substantia nigra pars lateralis (SNL).</s><s>We found that most of their axons were located within TS, with no other region containing fluorescence that differed significantly from baseline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>, e), indicating that TSprojecting dopamine neurons send very few collaterals to other regions.</s><s>We recorded the population activity of dopamine neurons in lateral SN, which is the primary location of TSprojecting dopamine neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) using fiber photometry.</s><s>Like dopamine axon signals in TS, signals from dopamine neurons in lateral SN covaried with tone intensity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>), and their small response to reward was not significantly modulated by reward size (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we recorded specifically from retrogradely labeled TS-projecting dopamine neurons using self-inactivating rabies virus (SiR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>, also see Methods).</s><s>Consistent with the activity we observed from dopamine axons in TS, we found that activity in TS-projecting dopamine neurons in lateral SN covaried with tone intensity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>) but not with water reward value (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>).</s><s>These neurons displayed increased responses to novel external stimuli as well, consistent with the idea that the signal is modulated by both external stimulus intensity and novelty (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</s><s>These results indicate that the unique activity observed in dopamine axons in TS was not due to local modulation at the axon level in TS, but rather reflects the activity at the cell bodies of this unique population in lateral SN.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulation of dopamine axons in TS causes avoidance and lesion of TS-projecting dopamine neurons reduces avoidance in a choice task</head><p><s>It is widely accepted that the activation of dopamine neurons is positively reinforcing.</s><s>In other words, dopamine release increases the frequency of actions or decisions that elicit dopamine release <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Our finding that the activity of TS-projecting dopamine neurons differs fundamentally from the activity of VS-projecting dopamine neurons suggests that TS-projecting dopamine neurons could have a different function.</s><s>Therefore, we tested whether direct stimulation of dopamine axons in TS is reinforcing in a choice task (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>).</s><s>First, mice were trained to enter a central port to initiate a trial and to then choose one of two side ports associated with different outcomes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>).</s><s>In this task, mice preferred the port associated with a large amount of water over a smaller amount of water, and avoided the port associated with air puff or bitter taste (quinine) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>).</s><s>In short, mice learned to develop choice biases according to the outcomes within a session.</s></p><p><s>Next, we examined the effect of optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in TS in a choice task.</s><s>After mice learned the choice task, the axons of VS-projecting or TS-projecting dopamine neurons were optogenetically activated using a light-gated ion channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in one of the two choice ports while mice received reward (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>).</s><s>The stimulation port was pseudo-randomly assigned in each session.</s><s>Stimulation in VS biased the animals' choices toward the port associated with stimulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>), consistent with the idea that dopamine acts as positive reinforcement.</s><s>On the other hand, stimulation in TS caused a bias against the port associated with stimulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>).</s><s>These results demonstrate that the optogenetic activation of dopamine axons in VS and TS have opposite effects on animals' behavioral choices.</s><s>Optogenetic activation of dopamine axons in TS caused avoidance of a behavioral choice associated with activation, instead of acting as a positive reinforcer of the choice.</s></p><p><s>Next, we tested whether ablation of TS-projecting dopamine neurons using a selective neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) had an effect on avoidance behavior (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>The 6-OHDA injections in TS specifically reduced dopamine innervation of TS and dopamine cell bodies in SNL without affecting neighboring dopamine axons in the striatum or amygdala, or noradrenaline neurons in the locus coeruleus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>), consistent with our rabies-based axon-labelling data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s>The lesion mice did not exhibit differences in general locomotor activity (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>We examined choice bias using different outcomes at two water ports (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref>).</s><s>When choosing between different sizes of water, both control and lesion mice showed a clear preference for the larger size of water (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>).</s><s>However, when given a choice between water and water plus air puff, lesion mice did not show systematic bias away from the side associated with air puff as a population (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>) and received more air puffs total in a session (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d</ref>).</s><s>Of note, we show here results of the first session when animals experienced air puff (see Methods), and during this single session individual lesion mice displayed a variety of port biases, consistent with the idea that random choice (i.e.</s><s>choosing both ports equally when both have the same value) is not necessarily a default strategy when random choice is not advantageous <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, choice stickiness, or "win-stay" strategy was observed in a similar frequency in a control session (choosing between two water ports) between control and lesion mice (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10c</ref>).</s><s>However, in an air puff session, whereas control mice repeated the same choice (stay) more often after the choice of a water port than after the choice of an air puff port, lesion mice showed a similar frequency of stay after the choice of either port (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10c</ref>), indicating that lesion mice did not acquire different choice preference even right after experiencing water plus air puff versus only water.</s><s>Surprisingly, the lesion animals' immediate behavioral responses to air puff remained largely unimpaired.</s><s>Lesion mice still displayed an immediate retreat with a similar retreat distance as controls in response to the first air puff (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a-c</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10d</ref>).</s><s>Over the course of the session, however, the lesion mice responded much differently.</s><s>While control mice continued to retreat from air puffs over many trials, lesion mice showed significantly smaller retreats after a few trials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a-c</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">11</ref>).</s><s>Thus, whereas detection of air puff and initial retreat responses to air puff itself were intact, lesion mice did not maintain the retreat responses in subsequent trials.</s><s>These results suggest that there is a system responsible for the initial retreat behaviors ("fixed reaction" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> ), which is independent of TS-projecting dopamine neurons, and that TS-projecting dopamine neurons are responsible for maintenance of the retreat.</s><s>Consistent with a role in maintenance or reinforcement of avoidance, dopamine axons in TS (in intact mice) responded strongly to air puffs and the signals remained high during this task (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5d</ref>-f, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10e</ref>), much like the signals we observed in head-fixed mice (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Notably, lesion mice were able to learn from other negative events such as bitter taste and water reduction at similar levels as control mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that TSprojecting dopamine neurons are not responsible for learning from all types of negative events.</s><s>This is consistent with our observation that the activity of dopamine axons in TS increased in response to external stimuli such as tone and air puff, but not in response to the bitter taste or omission of water (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether the effects of lesion on choice preference are dependent on dopamine, we pharmacologically inhibited D1 dopamine receptors in TS, and observed similar effects as in 6-OHDA lesion mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4e</ref>, f, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">12</ref>).</s><s>Thus, dopamine in TS is critical for avoiding air puff, and this is mediated at least partially by D1 receptor signaling.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Midbrain dopamine neurons projecting to TS reinforce avoidance of novel objects</head><p><s>Our results demonstrate that dopamine neurons in TS are important for learning to avoid air puff punishment.</s><s>However, TS-projecting dopamine neurons are excited not only by air puff, but also by seemingly neutral novel stimuli of multiple modalities 10 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>It is not immediately clear what air puff and novelty could have in common.</s><s>To understand the function of novelty signals in TS-projecting dopamine neurons, we first examined animals' behavioral responses to a novel object (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</s><s>When animals encounter novelty, they typically display elevated exploration, orientation, or approach to the novel stimulus compared to a familiar one <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with these observations, our mice approached novel objects more frequently than familiar objects (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a</ref>).</s><s>However, novel objects caused a more intricate behavior than simple approach.</s><s>Mice frequently performed "bouts" of investigation in which they approached the novel object and then quickly retreated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a</ref>, b, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a</ref>-b Saline, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">13</ref>, Supplemental Video 1).</s><s>The mice repeated these short bouts multiple times.</s><s>The bouts became gradually longer, and the mice spent more time at the vicinity of the novel object over days.</s><s>These approach-avoidance conflicts have been observed across various animal species including human beings, and have been interpreted as an unstable equilibrium of curiosity and timidity ("weal or woe" by William James) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , or a sense of potential fear.</s></p><p><s>To examine the role of TS-projecting dopamine neurons in this approach-retreat behavior, we recorded signals from dopamine axons in TS as mice interacted with a novel object in a familiar environment.</s><s>Signals in TS increased as mice reached the closest point of approach to the novel object in the bout (as they began to retreat), but not as they approached it (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6b-c</ref>).</s><s>The responses in TS were significantly larger when mice retreated from a novel object than from a familiar object or from the same location in an open field (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6c</ref>).</s><s>The signals in TS were not correlated with the animals' velocity or with the initiation of movement, indicating that the signal may not be directly related to motor activity (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">14</ref>).</s><s>To control for motion artifacts, we recorded from control mice expressing GFP instead of GCaMP and observed no obvious artifacts that could explain the GCaMP signals (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">14</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we tested whether and how TS-projecting dopamine neurons regulate animals' responses to novelty by lesioning TS-projecting dopamine neurons using 6-OHDA.</s><s>When the lesion mice first encountered a novel object, they exhibited a similar behavior as control mice: an approach followed by a quick retreat (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a</ref>-b, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">13</ref>, Supplemental Video 2).</s><s>Strikingly, after a few bouts, the lesion animals began to spend a much longer time near the novel object per bout (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a</ref>-b, Supplemental Video 3, Supplemental Video 4).</s><s>In total, lesion mice spent a significantly longer time near the object (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7b</ref>), but they did not approach the object more frequently than
