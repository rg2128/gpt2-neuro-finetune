<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>homologs, including LeuT, have shown how transmembrane helices (TMs) undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle, exposing a central binding site to either side of the membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr"

the conformational changes associated with transport in eukaryotic NSSs remain obscure.</s><s>To elucidate structure-based mechanisms for transport in SERT, we turned to complexes with ibogaine, a centuries old hallucinogenic natural product with psychoactive and anti-addictive properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, ibogaine displays non-competitive inhibition of transport, yet it exhibits competitive binding toward SSRIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Here we report cryo-EM structures of SERT-ibogaine complexes captured in outward-open, occluded, and inward-open conformations.</s><s>Ibogaine binds to the central binding site and closure of the extracellular gate largely involves movements of TMs 1b and 6a.</s><s>Opening of the intracellular gate involves a hingelike movement of TM1a and partial unwinding of TM5, which together create a permeation pathway enabling substrate and ion diffusion to the cytoplasm.</s><s>These structures define the structural rearrangements that occur from outward-open to the inward-open conformations, providing insight into the mechanism of neurotransmitter transport and ibogaine inhibition.</s></p><p><s>SERT, a ~70 kDa monomeric membrane protein, poses a challenge for single particle cryo-EM, and thus we used antibody fragments to provide mass and molecular features to facilitate cryo-EM reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>We also employed a N-and C-terminally truncated SERT construct, deemed ΔN72,C13, as well as three thermostable variants: ts2-active SERT, which maintains wild-type-like transport properties; ts2-inactive SERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> which is locked in the outward-open conformation; and C7x, which is devoid of reactive cysteines <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>To interrogate ibogaine modulation of SERT, we determined ibogaine inhibition of serotonin uptake for the ts2-active and ΔN72,C13 variants, finding that the IC 50 is 5 ± 1 µM (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref>).</s><s>Upon addition of 5 µM ibogaine, the V max was reduced by approximately 50% and the K m for serotonin was unchanged (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1b</ref>), consistent with ibogaine acting as a non-competitive inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>We also investigated the consequences of antibody binding, demonstrating that the ts2-active 15B8 Fab/8B6 scFv complex is transport inactive (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1b</ref>) while the ΔN72,C13 SERT-15B8 Fab complex is transport competent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Saturation binding experiments of [ 3 H]ibogaine in NaCl to ts2-active SERT without or with the 15B8 Fab yielded K d values of 400 ± 100 nM and 500 ± 200 nM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref>), respectively.</s><s>To investigate if ibogaine can also bind to the outward-open conformation, we carried out binding experiments on two variants locked in the outward-open conformation.</s><s>Via direct binding experiments of [ 3 H]ibogaine to the ts2-active 15B8 Fab/8B6 scFv complex and the ts2-inactive variant, we estimate a K d of 5-8 µM while in [ 3 H]paroxetine competition experiments with the ts2-active 15B8 Fab/8B6 scFv complex we measured a K i of 3 ± 0.4 µM (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>), experiments which together demonstrate that ibogaine binds ~10-fold more weakly to the outward-open conformation.</s><s>Moreover, electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that the ibogaine binding site is accessible from the extracellular solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , reinforcing the notion that ibogaine can bind to the transporter by way of the outward-open conformation.</s><s>We further explored ion dependence and found that ibogaine binds to SERT more tightly in KCl (K d of 130 ± 30 nM) or N-methyl-D-glucamine studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , and that the 15B8 Fab does not perturb ibogaine binding in KCl ( K d of 180 ± 50 nM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To probe the conformation of SERT employed in the cryo-EM studies reported here, we examined the Ser277Cys mutant, a residue located in the intracellular portion of TM5 that is solvent accessible in the inward-open conformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref>  (Extended Data Fig 1e).</s><s>As reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , the Ser277Cys mutant in the C7x background, when bound to ibogaine, is more reactive to methanethiosulfonate reagents than when bound to inhibitors that stabilize the outward-open conformation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>); this differential reactivity of the Ser277Cys variant is further pronounced in KCl in comparison to NaCl (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1d</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these observations are consistent with the notion that ibogaine increases the accessibility of the cytoplasmic permeation pathway.</s></p><p><s>To understand where ibogaine binds to SERT and how ibogaine binding influences the conformation of the transporter, we studied SERT using single particle cryo-EM.</s><s>To first validate that such studies were feasible, we carried out a 'control' reconstruction using the ts2-inactive 15B8 Fab/8B6 scFv complex with the SSRI, paroxetine.</s><s>We discovered that the cryo-EM map is well fit by the x-ray structure of the ts2-inactive, outward-open paroxetine complex (Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), and that the map has clear density features for aromatic side-chains and for paroxetine in the central binding site, thus demonstrating the feasibility of single particle cryo-EM of SERT-antibody complexes (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1h-j</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>With the feasibility of single particle studies established, we employed the ts2active SERT-15B8 Fab/8B6 scFv complex to investigate ibogaine binding to the outwardopen conformation.</s><s>This ibogaine-bound complex was determined at a resolution of ~4.1 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2a</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The TM densities were well-defined, continuous and of sufficient strength and connectivity to fit the main chain and to position many of the side chains (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a-g</ref>).</s><s>Comparison of this complex with known structures of SERT and other transporters allowed unambiguous assignment as the outward-open conformation (Extended Data Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3g-i</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further explore the conformations of SERT-ibogaine complexes, we employed Fabs that preserve uptake activity, first elucidating the structure of the ΔN72,C13 SERT-15B8 Fab complex in NaCl, obtaining a reconstruction of the complex at ~4.2 Å, revealing a conformation distinct from the outward-open (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Adjacent to TM1a, a density feature was found that is fit well by a molecule of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), similar to that observed in the dopamine transporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2b</ref>).</s><s>Comparison of the positions of TM1 and 6 and the extracellular gate to the equivalent elements of the outward-open complex indicates that this SERT-15B8 Fabibogaine complex, in NaCl, adopts an occluded conformation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In the presence of sodium, the accessibility of residues in the cytoplasmic permeation pathway is reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , showing that these conditions populate the inward-closed conformation while removal of sodium increases Thr276 phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and favors the inward-open conformation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, we examined the conformation of the ΔN72,C13 SERT-15B8 Fab-ibogaine complex in KCl; the resulting reconstruction yielded a density map at a resolution of ~3.6 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Supplementary Video 1).</s><s>At the cytoplasmic side, a distinct density feature associated with TM1a was observed in this reconstruction, corresponding to a 'splayed' conformation of TM1a away from the transporter core, opening the intracellular pathway.</s><s>The density feature for CHS near TM1a in the occluded conformation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref>) was not observed in the inward conformation, suggesting that its association may be conformation-dependent.</s><s>Removal of cholesterol from membranes increases ibogaine binding and mutation of residues lining the CHS binding site favors the inward conformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Non-proteinaceous features were also found near Thr276 and Ser277, sites of phosphorylation that influence transporter conformational equilibria <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>).</s><s>To further explore the influence of small molecules on the conformation of SERT, we examined noribogaine, an ibogaine metabolite <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> and non-competitive inhibitor of serotonin uptake (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6c-e</ref>).</s><s>A 3D reconstruction of the ΔN72,C13 SERT-15B8 Fab complex with noribogaine in 100 mM KCl yielded a density map at 6.3 Å, allowing visualization of helical segments (Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Subsequent rigid-body fitting of outward-open, occluded or the inward-open conformations into the density map showed that the best fit was obtained with inward-open (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6f-h</ref>), demonstrating that in KCl, ibogaine and noribogaine populate the inward-open conformation.</s></p><p><s>The quality of the density maps allowed localization of ibogaine at the central site and no other density features attributable to ibogaine.</s><s>Because the density maps are between 3.6-4.2</s><s>Å resolution, however, we employed computational docking followed by molecular dynamics simulations to determine the optimal binding poses of ibogaine in the central site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a-c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, Supplementary Video 2).</s><s>We discovered that the tertiary amine of ibogaine interacts with Asp98 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>) while the tricyclic ring system lodges between the aromatic groups of Tyr176 and Tyr95 in the outward-open and occluded conformations.</s><s>SERT-ibogaine interactions which are largely preserved in all three conformations include: the methoxy-group of ibogaine which protrudes into a cavity between TM3 and TM8, near Asn177; Ile172 which sits 'above' the tryptamine group and restrains the drug within the central site; and the aromatic ring of Phe341 which is adjacent to the indole nitrogen.</s><s>Upon assessing the binding pose of ibogaine, we observed that the side chain of Asn177 resides near the methoxy group of ibogaine and we reasoned that if the pose is accurate, mutation of the Asn to a smaller, less polar residue should enhance and diminish ibogaine and noribogaine affinity, respectively.</s><s>We thus measured the inhibition of transport by ibogaine and noribogaine and also the binding of [ 3 H]ibogaine for the Asn177Val, Asn177Ala, Asn177Thr and Asn177Leu mutants, finding more robust inhibition of 5-HT uptake by ibogaine and a weakening of inhibition by noribogaine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3e</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>).</s><s>Strikingly, the Asn177Val variant has a substantially higher binding affinity for [ 3 H]-ibogaine (70 ± 20 nM, P &lt; 0.01, one-sided student's t-test) in KCl, additionally supporting the binding pose for ibogaine.</s></p><p><s>We next analyzed the position of the extracellular and intracellular gates to further define the conformation of SERT, finding that the ibogaine-bound, outward-open reconstruction is similar to the x-ray structure of paroxetine-bound SERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>).</s><s>Ibogaine and ions can access the central binding site from the extracellular side, because gating residues (Arg104-Glu493, Cα-Cα distance: 12.0 Å; Tyr176-Phe335: 13.6 Å), conform to an open gate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3g</ref>) while the closed intracellular gate prevents exposure to the cytoplasm.</s><s>Upon formation of the occluded conformation, SERT undergoes movements within the core TMs closing the extracellular gate, preventing access of the central binding site.</s><s>In addition to the closure of the extracellular gate, the most substantial structural changes which occur during the transition from outward-open to the occluded conformation are found in TMs 1b, 5, 6, 7, 10 and in EL6 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref>).</s><s>The changes in helical position associated with TM6a include a tilting of 3° and a shift of 1.9 Å toward the scaffold.</s><s>EL6 also moves by 1.3 Å toward TM1b and TM6a while TM10 tilts by 2° and shifts 0.9 Å in the same direction.</s><s>TM7 shifts by 1.3 Å in the extracellular side toward the scaffold domain while TM5 experiences a 3.2° rotation and 1.3 Å shift toward TM7 and TM1b (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8c-e</ref>).</s><s>In NSSs, an allosteric site formed by residues in an extracellular vestibule modulates dissociation from the central site <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> .</s><s>The closure of the extracellular gate (Arg104-Glu493: 9.7 Å; Tyr176-Phe335: 13.5 Å) changes the nature of the extracellular vestibule, as the movement of TM6a toward the scaffold results in the collapse of the allosteric site as evidenced by a reduction in the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) (1448 vs. 1247 Å 2 ), thus reducing the likelihood of association of ibogaine or similar small molecules to the allosteric site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>EL3, which connects TM5 to TM6, further packs against the extracellular halves of these TMs.</s><s>Subtle changes are also observed in EL4 which experiences a minor shift toward the scaffold, and localized changes in the intracellular portion of TM5 were observed, which may facilitate the transition to the inward-open conformation and opening of TM1a (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also investigated the conformational transitions from the occluded to the inward-open states, finding that the most noteworthy structural rearrangements are at the closed extracellular and open intracellular gates.</s><s>TM1b shifts and tilts by 5.1 Å and 22° while TM6a moves by 3.4 Å and 5° further toward the scaffold, closing the extracellular gate as evidenced by a further reduction in the SASA of the allosteric site (973 Å 2 ) and the distance between extracellular gating residues (Arg104-Glu493: 9.9 Å; Tyr176-Phe335: 11.0 Å) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref>).</s><s>TM2 and TM7 undergo an associated movement of 2.8 and 1.0 Å in the extracellular Cα marker positions with an overall angular change of 7.3 and 4.8° toward the scaffold,
