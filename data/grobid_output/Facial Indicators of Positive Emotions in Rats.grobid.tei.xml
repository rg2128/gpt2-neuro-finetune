<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Until recently, research in animal welfare science has mainly focused on negative experiences like pain and suffering, often neglecting the importance of assessing and promoting positive experiences.</s><s>In rodents, specific facial expressions have been found to occur in situations thought to induce negatively valenced emotional states (e.g., pain, aggression and fear), but none have yet been identified for positive states.</s><s>Thus, this study aimed to investigate if facial expressions indicative of positive emotional state are exhibited in rats.</s><s>Adolescent male Lister Hooded rats (Rattus norvegicus, N = 15) were individually subjected to a Positive and a mildly aversive Contrast Treatment over two consecutive days in order to induce contrasting emotional states and to detect differences in facial expression.</s><s>The Positive Treatment consisted of playful manual tickling administered by the experimenter, while the Contrast Treatment consisted of exposure to a novel test room with intermittent bursts of white noise.</s><s>The number of positive ultrasonic vocalisations was greater in the Positive Treatment compared to the Contrast Treatment, indicating the experience of differentially valenced states in the two treatments.</s><s>The main findings were that Ear Colour became significantly pinker and Ear Angle was wider (ears more relaxed) in the Positive Treatment compared to the Contrast Treatment.</s><s>All other quantitative and qualitative measures of facial expression, which included Eyeball height to width Ratio, Eyebrow height to width Ratio, Eyebrow Angle, visibility of the Nictitating Membrane, and the established Rat Grimace Scale, did not show differences between treatments.</s><s>This study contributes to the exploration of positive emotional states, and thus good welfare, in rats as it identified the first facial indicators of positive emotions following a positive heterospecific play treatment.</s><s>Furthermore, it provides improvements to the photography technique and image analysis for the detection of fine differences in facial expression, and also adds to the refinement of the tickling procedure.</s></p></div>

<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), attenuate facial expressions of pain, suggesting that a face expressing pain may directly reflect the experience of a negative emotional state <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>This in conjunction with the findings that familiar mice mutually affect their pain behaviour based on each other's pain status <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and female mice choose to spend more time near familiar females in pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> leaves open the possibility that mice, and perhaps rodents in general, may actually pay attention to the facial expressions of conspecifics to gather information on their emotional state.</s><s>An alternative adaptive explanation for the function of facial expressions is that individuals may gain self-directed benefits from exhibiting such expressions.</s><s>In the same way as expressions of fear increase sensory exposure (e.g.</s><s>widening of the eyes to enhance vigilance) and expressions of disgust decrease it in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, expressions of aggression and/or fear in mice may be aimed at protecting vulnerable parts of the face (e.g., tightening of eyes, flattening of ears; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>).</s><s>Although the existence and functions of positive facial expressions in rodents are still unexplored, the same adaptive function hypotheses described for negatively valenced situations could be extended to contexts with positive hedonic value, like play, sex and feeding.</s><s>During 'rough-and-tumble' play, for example, dyads of rats compete for access to each other's nape using visual and tactile cues to detect and respond to play initiations of their play partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Considering also that relatively more playful rats have been found to increase play behaviour of their partner, suggestive of social contagion <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, it is possible that rats may at least partly sense (via sight and/or touch) the facial expressions of their partner, along with other body postures, to gather information on the likelihood the partner will initiate play, and how intense the play is likely to be.</s><s>In contrast, similarly to research in humans showing that the unconscious induction of one form of smile contributes to the positive self-assessment of an emotional experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, positive facial expressions in rats may per se induce a more positive hedonic state (e.g., through relaxation of parts of the face).</s></p><p><s>Overall, there is general consent on considering positive social interactions, such as play, as rewarding experiences that can elicit positive emotions in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Conspecific rough-and-tumble play is the most common form of play in juvenile rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and has characteristics that allow it to be clearly distinguished from true fights <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In the attempt to mimic this type of play within an heterospecific context between a rat and an experimenter, manual tickling has been developed and studied in relation to the experience of positive emotional state <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Tickling induces the same positively valenced ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) that are also emitted during conspecific play <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and has also been found to increase optimistic judgment bias in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, tickling most likely leads to the experience of positive emotional states, the intensity of which can be determined by measuring the number of USVs emitted by the animals during and between tickling bouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Rats emit different types of USVs in response to positive and negative situations, thus USVs represent a promising proxy measure of acute emotional valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Flat 22 kHz calls are emitted when rats experience negative stimuli or during avoidance behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and are thus considered to be associated with negative emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, frequency modulated (FM) 50 kHz USVs are emitted in situations considered to have an hedonic value, such as in anticipation of and during play, during sexual behaviour, and following stimulation of brain reward pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, and thus have been used as indicators of acute positive emotional state in rats.</s><s>Therefore, USVs represent a promising measure to identify rats' positive or negative emotional states within various experimental conditions including heterospecific play.</s></p><p><s>The purpose of this study was to determine if rats exhibit facial expressions indicative of positive emotional states after experiencing tickling by an experimenter.</s><s>Using an explorative approach, a number of qualitative and quantitative measures of facial expressions were scored and analysed using a procedure similar to the one used in already existing rodent grimace scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Measured facial expressions were then compared with those expressed by the same animals in a mildly aversive Contrast Treatment.</s><s>We hypothesised that if facial expressions reflect inner emotional states, the two different treatments would induce different facial expressions by the same rat.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical statement</head><p><s>This study was conducted in compliance with the Swiss regulations on animal experimentation and formally approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Bern (License no.</s><s>BE 17/13).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animals and housing</head><p><s>Subjects were 15 male Lister Hooded rats born from 14 litters.</s><s>This sample size was based on a power calculation (G Ã Power, version 3.1.9)</s><s>with an expected large effect size (Cohen's d z = 0.8).</s><s>These animals were selected from a larger pool of 75 rats from 25 litters born at Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany, based on their response to tickling by the experimenter (see "Selection of rats for Positive and Contrast Treatments" section).</s><s>All 75 rats were transported at weaning (21 ± 1 days of age) to the Division of Animal Welfare, University of Bern, Switzerland, and randomly sorted into groups of four non-littermates.</s><s>All rats were specificpathogen-free at arrival, in line with the FELASA recommendations for health monitoring of rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>After three weeks (43 days of age), all rats were resorted into new groups of three non-littermates, so that each group consisted of individuals with varying levels of conspecific playfulness.</s><s>This procedure was part of a parallel study investigating the development of social play in relation to individual personality differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>The formed groups remained stable for the duration of the present study, i.e. between 61 and 75 days of age.</s><s>Animals were housed in "Mickey 2 XL" cages (l × d × h: 80 cm × 50 cm × 38 cm; Savic, Belgium).</s><s>Cage bedding consisted of wood chips (JRS Lignocel), with three paper towels and three wooden tongue depressors provided weekly as enrichment.</s><s>Animals had ad libitum access to standard rodent food (KLIBA NAFAG, Switzerland) and tap water.</s><s>Housing room temperature was maintained between 21-24˚C and humidity between 50-70%, with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights off at 9 am).</s><s>All animals were tested during the dark phase and were identified by their pelage patterns.</s><s>At the end of the study some of the rats were adopted as pets, and the remaining rats were euthanised.</s><s>For the rats which were euthanised, they were first anaesthetised by means of isoflurane inhalation, and then euthanised through CO 2 inhalation followed by decapitation.</s><s>This procedure was in compliance with our experimental licence no.</s><s>BE 17/13.</s><s>The experimental design, including subjects and timeline, is shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test arena design and lighting</head><p><s>The test arena (l × d × h: 40 cm × 50 cm × 40 cm) was made of three sides with an open edge (S1 Fig) .</s><s>Surfaces on the three sides and floor were covered by grey cardstock paper.</s><s>A grey background was chosen so that both white and black rat whiskers would be visible from the photographs taken.</s><s>The floor and back wall consisted of one longer piece of paper bent into a concave curve to form an infinity cyclorama.</s><s>This allowed for photographs to have the most uniform backgrounds possible.</s><s>In addition, the curved floor encouraged animals to be closer to the open end of the test arena, better allowing for close-up photographs.</s><s>The microphone for vocalisation recording was suspended 30 cm above the floor of the test arena, allowing for full coverage of the area (see "Recording and analysis of vocalisations" section for recording equipment).</s><s>The test room was lit by built-in fluorescent white lights on the ceiling and an additional lamp with a 13 Watt bulb was placed adjacent to the test arena.</s><s>The brightness within the test arena from these two light sources was 650 lux.</s><s>This brightness was necessary in order to take high-speed photographs (see "Photography, selection, and analysis of images" section).</s><s>Habituation and Positive Treatment occurred in a test room adjacent to the housing rooms.</s><s>The Contrast Treatment occurred in a second test room located in close proximity to the housing rooms.</s><s>Both test rooms had the same test arena design and lighting.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Habituation to test conditions and tickling procedure</head><p><s>Handling.</s><s>All 75 animals were gently handled in their home cage by two experimenters (K.F. and J.F.L.), with touching, picking up, and some playful tickling.</s><s>Handling began at 25 days of age (five minutes per cage daily for five weeks) and continued until test arena habituation began.</s></p><p><s>Habituation to test arena and lighting conditions.</s><s>The experimental design required the animals to be tested under bright light during their active dark phase, thus gradual habituation to increasing periods of isolation, tickling and light exposure was performed in order to overcome anxiety.</s></p><p><s>All 75 animals experienced an eight day habituation procedure.</s><s>Throughout the habituation, all three cage mates were removed from the home cage and placed into a standard, transparent Type III cage (Tecniplast, Italy) in the corridor adjacent to the housing rooms, where they were exposed to 350 lux for two minutes to allow for adjustment to light.</s><s>The two-minute adjustment period was sufficient to prevent the display of any strong behavioural signs of distress (e.g., freezing behaviour, escape attempts) once the rats were placed in the test arena, which was lit at 650 lux.</s></p><p><s>First, at 61 days of age, all three cage mates were placed together into the test arena for one minute.</s><s>Then each rat was individually placed in the test arena for two consecutive 30 second periods, while its cage mates were kept in the Type III cage next to the test arena.</s><s>In the following two days, the isolation time in the test arena was gradually increased to two minutes.</s><s>On the next three days, all three cage mates were placed together in the test arena and tickled for a three minute period each day.</s><s>On the last day of habituation each animal was individually brought into the test room, without its cage mates being present in the room, and intermittently tickled for two minutes.</s><s>At the end of each test arena exposure, all rats were returned immediately to the home cage and rewarded with a piece of sweetened cereal (Honey Loops, Kellogg's).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tickling procedure</head><p><s>Animals were habituated to two different tickling procedures in preparation for the Positive Treatment.</s><s>The first was an established method developed by Panksepp and Burgdorf <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>It consisted of using one hand to quickly turn the animal on its back and perform rapid, finescale finger movements on its neck, chest, and stomach area, then releasing the animal and allowing it to right itself (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Tickling was performed for 3-5 seconds before releasing the animal, and a "tickling bout" consisted of multiple pins, tickles, and releases in a 15 second period.</s><s>A second, novel tickling procedure was developed by the experimenter to further induce a positive emotional state.</s><s>Similar to a method used by Rygula et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, where animals were supported on their backs by one hand and tickled with the other, this procedure consisted of holding the rat with two hands and focused more on stimulating the sides and nape of the neck with the fingertips, as the nape is the target of "rough-and-tumble" play in juvenile rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>Rats were scooped with both hands and tilted backwards in supine position.</s><s>While supported by the hands, the sides and nape of the neck were vigorously jiggled with the fingertips (Fig 2b; see also S1 Appendix for more detail).</s><s>The FM 50 kHz USVs elicited by this novel method were as loud as or louder than those elicited by the one-handed method (as observed by visual inspection of the spectrograms; S2 Fig) .</s><s>Since one-handed tickling had the advantage of being quite established in the literature, and two-handed tickling had the advantage of producing louder positive USVs, a mixture of both one-handed and two-handed tickling was used in the habituation phase.</s><s>Within each tickling bout the rat was tickled with two hands once for 3-5 seconds, and tickled with one hand during the remaining bout time.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of rats for Positive and Contrast Treatments</head><p><s>After the habituation phase, an ad hoc selection test was developed and performed to identify the 15 rats (out of the 75 available rats) which responded most positively to tickling, i.e. those that could be considered the most suitable candidates to detect differences between Positive and Contrast Treatments.</s><s>At 70 days of age, rats were selected following a two-step procedure which consisted of (i) assessing the number of approach behaviours after tickling in the home cage and (ii) counting the number of FM 50 kHZ USVs emitted during tickling in the test arena.</s></p><p><s>The approach behaviour measure was based on previous research showing that rats which enjoy tickling interactions will pursue the experimenter's hand after a tickling bout <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>It consisted of performing one-handed tickling for three seconds on each animal in the home cage during the dark phase, repeated three times.</s><s>The animal had to return to the experimenter's hand or to the open cage door within five seconds, after each of the three tickling events.</s><s>Resistance to pinning or a slow return served as the exclusion criteria, and those animals were not brought to the second part of the selection test.</s></p><p><s>Qualifying animals (N = 49) were first habituated to light in groups for two minutes and were then individually placed in the test arena.</s><s>Over a two minute period, each rat experienced 15 seconds of habituation, followed by four bouts of two-handed tickling, one bout of onehanded tickling, and a final bout of two-handed tickling.</s><s>The number of positive and negative vocalisations were recorded and analysed (see "Recording and analysis of vocalisations" section).</s><s>The 15 animals that emitted the greatest number of positive vocalisations and made no negative vocalisations were selected.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative measures</head><p><s>Qualitative scoring was comprised of the established Rat Grimace Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> together with two novel measures, Ear Colour and the visibility of the Nictitating Membrane.</s><s>We found that Ear Colour was significantly pinker in the Positive compared to the Contrast Treatment, while the Rat Grimace Scale measures and the Nictitating Membrane visibility were not affected by treatments.</s></p><p><s>Images of animals in the Positive Treatment were rarely scored as 0 (not present) for Ear Colour, while the majority of them were scored as 2 (obviously present).</s><s>This indicates that to a certain degree all rats in the study had ears showing a flushed, pink colour as a result of the Positive Treatment (yet see potential limitations of image assessment in Photography section).</s></p><p><s>At normal body temperature (37˚C), rat ears appear "pale" in colour, with faintly visible blood vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, ears appear "pinker" as a consequence of an increased dilatation of vessels in the skin <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</s><s>This vasodilatation could stem from a variety of conditions occurring in the Positive Treatment.</s></p><p><s>First, blood vessels within the rat ear dilate when "the ear itself [. .</s><s>.] is rubbed between the fingers" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, p. 313).</s><s>Therefore, the occasional physical stimulation of the ears against the floor of the test arena or fingertips during the tickling procedure could have increased vasodilatation.</s><s>However, the ears were at no point the target of the tickling procedure, thus it appears unlikely that the pinker colour observed in the Positive Treatment was mainly or exclusively caused by physical stimulation of the ears.</s></p><p><s>Second, the physical exertion of tickling may have contributed to an increase in heart rate.</s><s>Locomotor activity positively correlates with heart rate in the rat <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and increased heart rate is linked to increased vasodilatation in the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, which may have induced the change in ear colour.</s><s>Thus, differences in physical activity between treatments could explain Ear Colour change.</s></p><p><s>Lastly, besides physical activity, heart rate and thus vasodilatation can also increase due to (positive) emotional arousal.</s><s>For example, when conditioned to anticipate a food reward, rats show a significant increase in heart rate while consuming the reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</s><s>Although heart rate is mainly a measure of emotional arousal rather than valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>, the increased vasodilatation within the ears together with the simultaneous emission of FM 50 kHz vocalisations may reflect physiological changes in the body indicative of a positive emotional state.</s></p><p><s>The Rat Grimace Scale measures showed no differences between treatments.</s><s>In both treatments rats exhibited very few or none of the facial expressions indicative of pain, i.e.</s><s>Orbital Tightening, Nose/Cheek Flattening, Ear Change, and Whisker Change.</s><s>This result supports the conclusion that these grimacing expressions are related to pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> or potentially associated with negative emotional state more generally as demonstrated in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, but that they are not expressed when rats experience positive emotional states.</s><s>In addition, the Rat Grimace Scale measures were minimally affected by the Contrast Treatment which confirms that this treatment was not strongly aversive to the animals.</s><s>Finally, since the rats were not squinting during treatments (all Orbital Tightening scores were 0) we can conclude that the lighting conditions were not highly aversive and that the animals had adjusted to the brightness before photographs were taken.</s></p><p><s>The Nictitating Membrane was only moderately to not visible in either treatment.</s><s>An increased visibility of the Nictitating Membrane can be interpreted as a non-specific sign of illness and/or injury in dogs and cats <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, and has been linked to pain-related orbital tightening in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>It is therefore possible that the visibility of this membrane may be specific to painrelated conditions of illness or injury, which would explain the absence of a treatment effect in our study.</s><s>Moreover, the visibility of the membrane may be influenced by the direction in which the rat is looking.</s><s>This may limit the practicability of this measure since only images with

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Improvements to photography technique and tickling procedure</head><p><s>Photography.</s><s>A hand-held photo camera was used for capturing facial expressions in both experimental treatments.</s><s>Compared to video cameras that were fixed in their position in other studies on facial expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, holding the camera by hand in this study allowed the experimenter to follow the rats' movements and adapt the angle of the camera to the position of their faces.</s><s>Moreover, since pictures were taken with the photo camera and not by frame grabbing from video clips, picture quality was very high, making the identification of subtle differences in the face possible.</s><s>However, high-speed photography is vulnerable to variation in photograph brightness.</s><s>Despite attempts to maintain identical lighting within both test rooms, photographs taken during the Contrast Treatment were more likely to be darker than those taken during the Positive Treatment, possibly because the animals used different areas of the test arena during the two treatments.</s><s>This difference in brightness may have an influence on colour-based scoring systems (i.e.</s><s>Ear Colour), and images that are too different in brightness should be removed from the analysis and / or colour-corrected to avoid scoring biases, as done in this study.</s><s>Additional tools assessing variation in blood flow, such as infrared thermography <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> could also be used in conjunction with Ear Colour scoring.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, a relatively high light intensity (650 lux) was required to obtain good quality images, and this could have potentially affected the response of the rats to the treatments.</s><s>However, the light intensity used in this study falls within the range of laboratory room light conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and the rats were gradually and extensively habituated to being tickled under white light.</s><s>Since, overall, the rats emitted a large number of positive USVs during the Positive Treatment, we conclude that light intensity at testing is unlikely to have affected our results.</s></p><p><s>Novel tickling procedure.</s><s>Tickling in previous studies consisted of either repeatedly pinning the rat to a surface with one hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> or holding the rat with one hand, while tickling with the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the method developed by Panksepp and Burgdorf <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, this study used a novel procedure consisting of scooping the rats with both hands and vigorously jiggling the sides and the nape of the neck.</s></p><p><s>Animals appeared to respond more positively (e.g., with louder positive USVs as assessed by visual inspection of spectrograms; S2 Fig) when handled using the novel tickling procedure.</s><s>Due to the relatively hard floor of the test arena, the scooping-and-tilting backwards may have been more comfortable for the rat compared to a flip-and-pin onto the floor.</s><s>Rats in this study were older and heavier compared to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, so this method may be more appropriate for older animals.</s><s>Furthermore, this novel tickling procedure entails greater stimulation of the nape, which is the main target in rough-and-tumble play in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, thus it may be experienced by the rat as more similar to conspecific play.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and further research</head><p><s>The identification of positive facial expressions indicative of positive emotional states in rats could serve as an alternative to or complementary part of existing methods (e.g., positive USVs, cognitive bias) to assess positive animal welfare.</s><s>This study identified two potential, preliminary indicators of positive facial expression in rats, namely change in Ear Colour and Ear Angle, by comparing a positive emotional state induced by playful tickling and a neutral to mildly negative emotional state induced by exposure to a novel environment and white noise.</s><s>Even though potentially being limited to the specific treatments and image assessment methods in this study, these measures could provide a basis for future research on positive emotional states.</s><s>Changes in Ear Colour are unlikely to support any communicative function between rats, as rats have poor colour discrimination and are more active in darkness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, but may rather reflect the experience of internal physiological changes.</s><s>Similarly, changes in Ear Angle are likely to indicate relaxation of the muscles controlling ear movement during a positive experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref> which cost less energy compared to situations requiring alertness.</s></p><p><s>To improve generalisability of our findings, further work on Ear Colour should focus on disentangling positive emotional valence from the physical activity of tickling.</s><s>For example, having a control treatment in which the neck and dorsal spine of the rat are physically stimulated in order to induce negative 22 kHz USVs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>), could serve as a way to measure emotional valence while controlling for arousal and somatosensory stimulation.</s><s>Also, further research should investigate the change in ear posture and colour in relation to a variety of positive and negative stimuli other than tickling and unpredictable white noise, respectively.</s><s>For instance, rats presented with rewarding gustatory stimuli performed rhythmic tongue movements and changes in facial musculature <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, resembling facial expressions made by nonhuman primates and human infants when exposed to similar flavours <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>It would be interesting to investigate whether such tongue protrusions are also associated with changes in ear angle and colour.</s><s>With respect to changes in Ear Angle, it would also be interesting to measure the frequency of changes in ear position and the asymmetry in ear posture through continuous focal observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
