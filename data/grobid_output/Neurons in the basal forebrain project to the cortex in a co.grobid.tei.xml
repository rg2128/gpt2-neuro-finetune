<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The basal forebrain (BF) contains a diverse population of neurons, including cortically projecting cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons as well as various interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Zaborszky et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In Alzheimer's and related neurodegenerative diseases, there is a severe loss of cholinergic neurons (for reference, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Zaborszky et al. 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Although the original descriptions of the cholinergic system in the early 1980s acknowledged that the BF corticopetal system shows topographic organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Saper 1984)</ref>, the heterogeneous distribution of cholinergic cells, the highly variable shape of the cholinergic space across the rostrocaudal extent of the BF, and the lack of information on how the topography of the BF corticopetal projection relates to corticocortical connections have contributed to the concept in neuroscience and psychology that the cholinergic BF system "diffusely" innervates the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Saper 1987)</ref>.</s><s>This "diffuse" hypothesis was seemingly supported by measurements of cortical acetylcholine (ACh) release using in vivo microdialysis techniques that did not indicate differences between cholinergic activities in different cortical regions during various behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sarter and Bruno 1997)</ref>.</s><s>However, the microdialysis technique used to collect cortical ACh has poor temporal and spatial resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rasmusson 2000)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, recent studies using enzyme-selective microelectrodes in attentional task-performing rats demonstrated that cholinergic signals manifest at different time scales in various cortical areas to support specific cognitive operations.</s><s>For example, selective cholinergic activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) on the scale of seconds is associated with cue detection, while changes on the scale of minutes may occur on a cortex-wide scale to support the more general arousal effect of ACh <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Parikh et al. 2007)</ref>.</s><s>These data would be hardly compatible with the concept of a diffuse organization.</s></p><p><s>Although ascending brainstem noradrenergic and dopaminergic axons contact cholinergic neurons in extensive portions of the BF, most of telencephalic afferents <ref type="bibr">(cortical, amygdaloid, striatal)</ref> appear to have a preferential distribution among subregions of the BF (for ref. <ref type="bibr">see Zaborszky et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">see Zaborszky et al. , 2012;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Zaborszky and Duque 2003)</ref>.</s><s>The PFC innervates noncholinergic neurons in the BF, including parvalbumin-containing cell populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Zaborszky et al. 1997)</ref>, suggesting some selectivity in the innervation pattern of various neurons.</s><s>Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that frontal and posterior cortical areas occupying similar mediolateral positions receive input from partially overlapping cell populations in the BF.</s><s>On the other hand, topographically noncorresponding frontal and posterior cortical areas receive projections from a nonoverlapping pool of neurons in the BF <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Zaborszky et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The aim of this study was to test, on a limited set of corticocortical connections, the hypothesis that overlapping subpopulations of BF neurons project to interconnected cortical areas.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, small amounts of Fluoro-gold (FG) and Fast Blue (FB) retrograde tracers were deposited into frontal and posterior cortical areas at various mediolateral locations in rats.</s><s>Retrogradely labeled cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons were mapped in the BF.</s><s>Additionally, retrogradely labeled cells in posterior cortical areas projecting to various frontal/prefrontal areas were mapped, and all cell populations were combined in the same coordinate system.</s><s>Using computational methods, the spatial and numerical relations of the various BF projection cell populations were determined and the projection "strength" (defined as the number of cortical projection neurons) among the cortical targets of the BF cell populations was characterized.</s><s>Here, we report that not only does the BF corticopetal system show a remarkably inhomogeneous organization, but this organization is also reflected in the corticocortical connections, so far unremarked upon and thus unexplained.</s><s>Our studies suggest that the cholinergic and noncholinergic projection to the neocortex is not diffuse, but instead, is organized into segregated or overlapping pools of neurons that may transmit information from specific locations from the BF to subsets of cortical areas that are themselves interconnected.</s><s>The observation that projections from the BF to cortical areas reflect corticocortical connectivity patterns is very similar to findings related to corticostriatal projections (see recent discussion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Calzavara et al. 2007</ref>) and thus may indicate a broader principle of forebrain organization.</s></p></div>
