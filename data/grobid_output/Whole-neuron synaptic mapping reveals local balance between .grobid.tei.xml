<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Voxel clustering for enhanced detection</head><p><s>In contrast to previous approaches that estimate spine volume from the spine tip backward toward the dendrite ( <ref type="formula">72</ref>), Spine Detector identifies potential spine voxels at the dendrite shaft and estimates their volume by iteratively adding layers of connected voxels toward the spine tips.</s><s>To quickly estimate the minimum distance between each voxel and the nearest dendrite surface, Spine Detector uses the radius of each node across the neuron trace as a representation of the dendrite surface and performs a distance transform on the image (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">S2C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">S2D</ref>).</s><s>The initial seeds of potential spines are the voxels the shortest distance from the dendrite surface.</s><s>In each iteration, potential spines are identified and grown by adding new layers of connected neighbor-voxels until a spine edge is detected.</s><s>This is achieved by establishing a floor value to the distance between the initial seeds and the dendrite surface and repeatedly adding layers of connected neighbor-voxels equal to the floor value of the previous layer.</s><s>At the end of each iteration, Spine Detector determines whether the number of voxels have exceeded the user-defined spine size and whether the maximum layer width has exceeded the user-defined layer width.</s><s>If the most recently added layer did not meet these criteria, all previous layers are discarded and the voxels in that layer serve as the seed for the next layer.</s><s>The iteration stops when all qualified voxels are assessed.</s><s>Spine candidates are rejected based on user-supplied parameters for minimum voxel count and minimum spine length, allowing users to reconstruct images acquired at different magnifications.</s><s>Notably, spines can be detected with this methodology regardless of the resolution of the spine neck.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intensity-based segmentation of adjacent spines</head><p><s>Limited image resolution, inaccurate thresholding, and physical proximity can all give rise to adjacent spines incorrectly categorized as a single synapse.</s><s>Based on the observation that spine voxel intensities are naturally brighter at the center than the edges, we adopted an adapted watershed algorithm to separate spines within close spatial proximity <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(74)</ref>.</s><s>First an initial threshold is set at a relatively high fluorescence intensity so that only the center-voxels of spines are identified (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">S2E</ref>).</s><s>With the successively decreasing fluorescence toward the spine border, the spine boundary grows in size.</s><s>When two potential spine boundaries meet they each become defined to separate adjacent spines.</s><s>The merger of two spine volumes is only considered when both spines are relatively small (lower than 1% of the average volume).</s></p></div>
