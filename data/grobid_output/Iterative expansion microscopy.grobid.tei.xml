<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>We recently discovered that preserved biological specimens, embedded in a swellable polymer gel with key biomolecules or labels anchored to the gel, and then mechanically homogenized, could be isotropically swelled ~4.5x in linear dimension by immersion in water -a process we call expansion microscopy (ExM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Since our original paper on ExM, we have developed variants that anchor proteins or RNA directly to the gel, enabling ease of use in a diversity of scientific and clinical contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>However, all ExM variants published to date expand biological specimens by ~4.5x in linear dimension, resulting in an effective resolution for a ~300 nm diffraction limited objective lens of ~60-70 nm (~300/4.5),</s><s>raising the question of whether it might be possible to expand biological specimens by greater expansion factors, resulting in better resolution.</s></p><p><s>In our original ExM protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , biological molecules of interest were first labeled with a primary antibody, followed by a secondary antibody bearing an oligonucleotide.</s><s>Then, a second oligonucleotide bearing a gel-anchoring moiety (a 5′ acrydite group) and a fluorophore was applied and anchored to a swellable polyelectrolyte gel synthesized evenly throughout the specimen, using a crosslinker to insure an interconnected topology for the polymer strands to support isotropic expansion.</s><s>After mechanical homogenization with strong protease treatment, the polymer-specimen composite could then be expanded in water <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Expanding a gel &gt; 4.5-fold was possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> but resulted in fragile gels.</s><s>We here explored whether it would be possible to synthesize, post-expansion, a second gel that could expand the specimen further, that would provide sufficient mechanical support (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-e</ref>).</s><s>For such an iterative ExM (iExM) protocol, we must transfer the information from the first gel to the second, then disrupt the first gel, and finally expand the second gel; to make the first gel disruptible, we used a chemically cleavable crosslinker for its synthesis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design of iExM chemistry</head><p><s>We implemented iExM by first taking a sample and expanding it using ExM as in our original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , but with the second oligonucleotide applied (green in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>) without a fluorophore, and using a cleavable crosslinker (e.g., the commercially available crosslinker N,N′-(1,2-dihydroxyethylene) bisacrylamide (DHEBA), whose diol bond can be cleaved at high pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> ) for gel synthesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s><s>We then embedded the expanded sample in an uncharged polyacrylamide gel prepared with a cleavable crosslinker (the re-embedding gel <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> ) so that it could be held in the expanded state during subsequent steps.</s><s>In particular, this reembedding gel allowed us to apply a third oligonucleotide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>), bearing a gel-anchoring moiety and fluorophore, which hybridized to the oligonucleotide anchored to the first reduced in the future by using different DNA-antibody conjugation strategies (schematized in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>; see also Supplementary Note 4).</s></p><p><s>Using these models, we quantitatively estimated the resolution of the overall iExM process.</s><s>First, we measured the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of single microtubule sidewalls, deriving a value of 25.8 ± 7.7 nm for the point spread function (PSF) of the overall iExM process, from staining to gelation and expansion to optical imaging (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>To attempt to estimate the resolution of the iExM process independent of the label (e.g., focusing on the optical, gelation and expansion components), we deconvolved actual images of microtubule sidewalls by a simulated structure of an idealized DNA/antibody-labeled microtubule sidewall (generated according to the model of Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), resulting in the slightly smaller value of 22.3 ± 5.3 nm (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we attempted to isolate just the amount of PSF broadening due to the gelation and expansion steps specifically.</s><s>We simulated (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>) how microtubules would be expected to look, after staining and optical imaging, assuming that gelation and expansion induced zero error.</s><s>The resultant PSF was ~6 nm smaller than the actual PSF obtained for the entire iExM process, suggesting that the processes of forming and expanding the multiple gels involved with iExM introduced ~6 nm of additional resolution error, beyond the effects of the antibodies, DNA, and optics (see Supplementary Note 5).</s><s>Such a PSF broadening does not greatly alter the mean peak-to-peak distance between target proteins arranged in a complex (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>), but instead widens the appearance of small things via broadening the PSF of iExM.</s></p><p><s>In expansion microscopy, physical expansion occurs in axial as well as lateral directions, and thus magnifies specimens along the optical axis as well as in the focal plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>When a yzplane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2h</ref>) was reconstructed from the z-stack image shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>, the circular cross-section of a microtubule was resolvable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2j</ref>, inset).</s><s>The nanoscale axial resolution of iExM enabled clear visualization of microtubules of BS-C-1 cells in 3-D (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2).</s></p><p><s>We applied iExM to preserved mouse tissues, including brain, liver, and lung, to determine whether iExM could resolve ~20-nm biological structures in intact tissues.</s><s>As shown in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2k</ref> (single z-plane image; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2l</ref> for the entire cellular context), the sidewalls of microtubules in mouse brain slices were resolvable on a confocal microscope.</s><s>The distance between the two peaks of the fitted Gaussians was similar to that obtained in the cultured cell case (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2m</ref>; population data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2n</ref>).</s><s>The sidewalls of microtubules in cells of mouse lung and liver tissue slices were also easily resolved on confocal microscopes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-h</ref>).</s><s>In addition to the visualization of the sidewalls of microtubules in tissues, we found that individual components of microtubule bundles in the mouse cortex could be resolved after 18-fold expansion (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7i-l</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition to resolution, the ability to tell finely spaced objects apart, another optical parameter of interest is distortion across more extended length scales.</s><s>Accordingly, we quantified the distortion caused by iExM over various length scales that correspond to feature sizes of interest in cell biology.</s><s>To measure distortion over scales of several microns, we compared pre-expansion images taken on a super-resolution microscope to post-expansion images taken on a conventional diffraction-limited microscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>We prepared samples with secondary antibodies labeled with STORM dyes, and simultaneously applied DNA-conjugated secondary antibodies so that they could be processed for iExM and visualized post-expansion.</s><s>We co-registered the pre-expansion STORM image and postexpansion confocal image via a rigid transformation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2o</ref>), and then calculated the deformation vector field between the two images <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Although the image qualities enabled by STORM and iExM were compromised in this specific experiment because of the special requirements involved in imaging the same sample with both methods (e.g., each label will occur at half the antibody labeling density of a typical experiment, since we are dual labeling), the root-mean-square (RMS) alignment error between iExM and STORM was nonetheless small, about 2.5% of measurement length (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2p</ref>) over scales of several microns, similar to the 1%-4% range of alignment errors previously determined for ExM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>We estimated the distortion of iExM across length scales of tens to hundreds of nanometers by examining the variation of microtubule diameter along 400 nm distances down the long axis of the microtubule.</s><s>The estimated distortion was found to be 9 nm for cells and 13 nm for tissues (see Supplementary Note 6 for details).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nanoscale imaging of synapses</head><p><s>We next explored the utility of iExM in the context of resolving proteins within synapses.</s><s>To improve brightness of expanded specimens, we pursued two signal amplification methods, using either DNA or locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes to increase the number of fluorophores associated with a single gel-anchored oligo (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> for schematic; see also Supplementary Note 7).</s><s>We first examined synapses of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons.</s><s>We labeled synapses with sets of antibodies that indicate putative excitatory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref>) or inhibitory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d-f</ref>) synapses -anti-Homer1, anti-Bassoon, and anti-Glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) for the former, and anti-Gephyrin, anti-Bassoon, and anti-Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor Aα1/anti-Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor Aα2 (GABA A Rα1/α2; labeled with the same oligonucleotide strand) for the latter.</s><s>It was possible not only to resolve the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bassoon from the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins Homer1 and Gephyrin, but also possible to resolve proteins within a synaptic compartment -resolving the neurotransmitter receptors GluR1 and GABA A Rα1/α2 from their respective post-synaptic scaffolding proteins as well (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>We could observe the geometric organization of proteins within synapses, for example seeing how GluR1 proteins sometimes formed ring structures around Homer1 proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>, dotted circle in the upper right inset), as has been previously reported using STORM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>The isotropic 3-D nature of iExM expansion allowed us to resolve structures organized along the optical axis of the microscope, for example resolving ring structures of GluR1 when the synaptic cleft was parallel to the microscope's optical axis (Fig 3g, dotted circle in the bottom).</s></p><p><s>We demonstrated the utility of iExM to resolve synaptic structures in the mouse brain.</s><s>We immunostained a mouse brain slice with antibodies against Bassoon and Homer1, expanded the brain slice 16-fold with iExM, and then imaged putative synapses within four different brain regions (overview in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h</ref>; iExM images taken on a confocal microscope in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3io</ref>; see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> for additional images taken with epifluorescence microscopy).</s></p><p><s>The average distances between Bassoon and Homer1 observed in two regions within primary somatosensory cortex (indicated with Roman numerals i and ii in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h</ref>, and highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3i</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref>) were similar to each other (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3p,</ref><ref type="figure">q</ref>) and to Bassoon-Homer distances observed in the dorsal striatum (indicated with Roman numerals iii in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h</ref>, and highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3k</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3r</ref> for the population data).</s><s>However, a fourth region -the medial pallidum (indicated with Roman numeral iv in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h</ref>, and highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure">l-o</ref>), exhibited distances between Bassoon and Homer1 that were 50% larger (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3s</ref>), suggestive of a different synaptic architecture; furthermore, although putative synapses were evenly distributed in cortex and striatum, in the pallidum, synapses were arranged in regularly spaced patterns as if they were tiling a cylindrical target (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3l-o</ref>;
