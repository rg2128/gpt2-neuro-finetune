<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Signaling by neuromodulators such as monoamines differs in multiple ways from signaling by the classical neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA.</s><s>Release of glutamate and GABA at synaptic contacts activates fast ionotropic receptors that provide precise information about timing.</s><s>In contrast, monoamines activate slower G protein-coupled receptors, and dopamine neurons form en passant presynaptic boutons, often without clear postsynaptic element <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hattori et al., 1991)</ref>.</s><s>As a result, these cells have been thought to signal through changes in the extracellular concentration of dopamine, which generally reflects firing rate rather than timing.</s><s>The difference between synaptic and volume transmission has thus been considered to reflect the properties of the receptors (ionotropic versus metabotropic) and their distance from the release site.</s><s>However, differences in the mode of transmission also impose distinct requirements on the properties of release.</s><s>Temporal coding requires fast, synchronous release.</s><s>In contrast, frequency coding requires sustained release at rates proportionate to firing.</s></p><p><s>Midbrain dopamine neurons fire in two patterns, tonic (4-5 Hz) and bursting (~20 Hz), and the dopamine release that signals unexpected reward and promotes movement depends on burst firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Howe and Dombeck, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schultz et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, dopamine release increases greatly with stimulation frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Koranda et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sulzer et al., 2016)</ref>, suggesting a low release probability that minimizes vesicle depletion and enables release to follow firing rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dittman et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>In midbrain dopamine neurons, the Ca ++ -binding protein calbindin indeed reduces the coupling of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic Ca ++ channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pan and Ryan, 2012)</ref>, which reduces release probability.</s><s>In principle, this mechanism would be expected to impair the regulated exocytic release of any classical transmitter by these same cells.</s></p><p><s>However, many neurons including dopamine neurons corelease at least two different classical transmitters <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(El Mestikawy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tritsch et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In some cases, release of both occurs from the same synaptic vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chaudhry et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Jonas et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ren et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tritsch et al., 2012)</ref> and hence with the same properties.</s><s>One transmitter can promote packaging of the other: vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 promotes the storage of dopamine by mesolimbic dopamine projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Birgner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hnasko et al., 2010)</ref> and VGLUT3 the storage of acetylcholine (ACh) by cholinergic interneurons in the striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gras et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nelson et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>This phenomenon requires expression of the two transporters on the same synaptic vesicles.</s><s>In this case, the two transmitters activate different receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lamotte d'Incamps et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ren et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Sengupta et al., 2017)</ref> but convey the same information about neural activity.</s><s>Ultrastructural analysis of the striatum has suggested segregation of dopamine and glutamate release sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Zhang et al., 2015)</ref>, but mesolimbic dopamine neurons appear to release glutamate and dopamine with very similar properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adrover et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, starburst amacrine cells in the retina corelease ACh and GABA, and their signaling shows a differential dependence on Ca ++ , suggesting a presynaptic mechanism for the differences in response <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lee et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Recent work has suggested a similar difference between ACh and GABA release by basal forebrain neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Takacs et al., 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous work has attributed variation in the properties of release to extrinsic factors such as the association of synaptic vesicles with the cytoskeleton or their proximity to Ca ++ channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chi et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eggermann et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Midorikawa et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>However, these and other extrinsic factors such as Ca ++ buffering cannot alone account for differences in the release of two transmitters by the same cell.</s><s>Alternatively, synaptic vesicles may differ in their intrinsic properties, reflecting differences in composition and hence identity.</s><s>The phenomenon of corelease provides an entrypoint to test this possibility.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glutamate and Dopamine Release from VTA Dopamine Neurons Differ in Short-Term Plasticity</head><p><s>To assess the relationship between glutamate and dopamine release by ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, we used postsynaptic recording in brain slices.</s><s>Since dopamine does not usually produce detectable postsynaptic currents, we took advantage of a G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K + channel (GIRK2) that couples to D2 dopamine receptors when expressed in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Marcott et al., 2014)</ref>, enabling direct comparison of postsynaptic glutamate and dopamine responses.</s><s>After injection of recombinant AAV encoding GIRK2 into the ventral striatum, we expressed channelrhodopsin specifically in dopamine neurons by introducing the conditional AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2-mCherry into the VTA of mice expressing cre recombinase under the control of the dopamine transporter (DATicre).</s><s>Using striatal slices from these mice, light evokes both rapid EPSCs and slow, inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in SPNs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>As expected, glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX and APV block the EPSC, and D2 dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride completely abolishes the slow IPSC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>In addition, expression of GIRK2 was shown not to affect basic membrane properties, and the D2-IPSCs recorded here are smaller (in amplitude and duration) than those reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Marcott et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The ability of vesicular glutamate transport to promote monoamine and ACh uptake requires storage of the two transmitters in at least some of the same synaptic vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gras et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hnasko et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nelson et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Entry of the anion glutamate dissipates the lumen-positive membrane potential, thereby disinhibiting the H + -ATPase to create the low internal pH that drives monoamine and ACh uptake.</s><s>Since dissipation of the pH gradient can also create the membrane potential that drives glutamate transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goh et al., 2011)</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>) and vesicular monoamine transport involves H + exchange, we further assessed costorage by inhibiting VMAT2.</s><s>As anticipated, the VMAT2 inhibitor TBZ (5 μM) blocks the D2-IPSC, but it also reduces the amplitude of light-evoked EPSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Uptake of dopamine by VMAT2 thus promotes glutamate storage and release, indicating at least some storage of both transmitters in the same vesicles.</s><s>However, the extent of costorage remains unclear.</s></p><p><s>Although previous work has not indicated a difference in the release of glutamate and dopamine by mesolimbic dopamine neurons, dopamine release was measured by electrochemical detection with a carbon fiber electrode, which reflects dopamine spillover into the bulk extracellular space <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adrover et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Taking advantage of GIRK2 expression to compare the postsynaptic responses to dopamine and glutamate, we observe a clear difference in paired pulse ratio (PPR) between the light-evoked D2-IPSC and the EPSC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>).</s><s>Due to the duration of the D2-IPSC, we stimulated at relatively long intervals (2.5 s to 50 s).</s><s>In slices, however, dopamine release exhibits long-lasting depression independent of D2 autoreceptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kennedy et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Phillips et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Shin et al., 2017)</ref> that enables us to compare the extent of depression even at this low stimulation frequency.</s><s>The EPSC depresses more than the D2-IPSC and the difference is greatest at 2.5 s but remains throughout recovery (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>).</s><s>In addition, prolonged stimulation at 0.4 Hz shows that the difference between D2-IPSC and EPSC persists throughout trains: the D2-IPSC remains easily detectable whereas the EPSC almost disappears (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G,</ref><ref type="figure">H</ref>).</s><s>We used the D2 antagonist sulpiride to isolate the glutamate-mediated currents, but the blockade of autoreceptors does not affect the extent of depression at this low stimulation frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benoit-Marand et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Shin et al., 2017)</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>).</s><s>We also blocked GABA A , GABA B , muscarinic and D1 dopamine receptors, supporting direct rather than indirect, network effects of the transmitters released by dopamine neurons.</s></p><p><s>Use of GIRK channels to measure receptor activation has suggested that D2 dopamine receptors exhibit lower affinity than previously recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Marcott et al., 2014)</ref>, but differences in receptor saturation might nonetheless account for the differences in synaptic depression between glutamate and dopamine.</s><s>The amounts of dopamine released might decline as rapidly as the amounts of glutamate but show less apparent depression due to saturation of the first response.</s><s>To assess this possibility, we reduced dopamine biosynthesis and stores by systemic injection of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) inhibitor α-methyl-ptyrosine (AMPT).</s><s>AMPT reduces the dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>), indicating that the compound has reduced vesicular stores <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fon et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, AMPT slightly reduces EPSC amplitude (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>), as expected for the subset of synaptic vesicles storing both transmitters.</s><s>However, AMPT has no effect on the synaptic depression observed with prolonged stimulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1F</ref>), indicating that receptor saturation cannot account for the difference in depression from the EPSC.</s></p><p><s>The differences in short-term plasticity between glutamate and dopamine release by VTA dopamine neurons suggest a difference in sensitivity to Ca ++ .</s><s>Relative to 2.5 mM external Ca ++ , however, optogenetic activation of mesostriatal terminals produces EPSCs and D2-IPSCs of similar magnitude in 0.5 and 1.0 mM Ca ++ (Figure <ref type="figure">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Despite the lack of difference in Ca ++ sensitivity, we also tested the coupling to different Ca ++ channel subtypes.</s><s>The P-/Q-type Ca ++ channel inhibitor ω-agatoxin TK inhibits the D2-IPSC more than the EPSC (Figure <ref type="figure">2C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>Remarkably, the N-type ω-conotoxin GVIA inhibits the EPSC much more strongly than the D2-IPSC (Figure <ref type="figure">2C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>Thus, glutamate release by dopamine neurons couples preferentially to N-type channels, and dopamine release to P-/Qtype channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Phillips and Stamford, 2000)</ref>, consistent with the storage of transmitter in different vesicle populations and perhaps release at distinct sites.</s><s>Since these vesicle populations contain different transmitters, intrinsic
