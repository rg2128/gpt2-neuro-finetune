<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>I n the mammalian brain, most neurons are born in utero and assemble into functional circuits during late embryonic and early postnatal development.</s><s>Hence, neuronal maturation and initial circuit formation are temporally related.</s><s>In contrast, in the olfactory system, adult-born neurons are integrated into functional circuits throughout life <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> .</s><s>In combination with its anatomy, the amenability of the olfactory bulb (OB) to both optical imaging and activity manipulation make it the ideal system in which to dissociate the cell autonomous and targetderived factors that regulate synaptogenesis in conjunction with sensory experience.</s></p><p><s>One of the regenerating neural populations of the olfactory system, the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), is located in the olfactory epithelium, and provides sensory input to the OB.</s><s>OSNs take 7-8 days from terminal cell division to reach maturity, as defined by the onset of expression of olfactory marker protein (OMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Each mature OSN expresses a single allele of one of several hundred odorant receptors, and OSNs expressing the same odorant receptor project their axons to the same glomerulus in the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> , producing a highly organized anatomical odour map.</s><s>Within the glomerulus, OSNs form excitatory synapses with both principal neurons and periglomerular interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> .</s><s>However, how OSN synaptogenesis is governed by neuronal maturity remains an open question.</s><s>During embryonic development, the onset of OMP expression coincides with formation of the first sensory synapses in the OB, at E14-15 (refs 13-16).</s><s>Hence, it is unclear whether maturation is a prerequisite for synaptogenesis, or vice versa.</s><s>Furthermore, whether OSNs retain the capacity for synaptogenesis throughout their lifespan, or whether rewiring is instead effected purely by OSN turnover, is completely unknown.</s><s>Understanding both when newborn neurons can initiate synaptogenesis, and whether any level of ongoing synaptogenesis is retained once neurons have matured, has profound implications for plasticity and repair of neural circuits.</s></p><p><s>Here, we used a genetic strategy to selectively label and manipulate immature and mature OSNs.</s><s>Using electron microscopy, optogenetic photoactivation and in vivo multi-electrode recording, we demonstrate that OSNs still expressing immature markers form synapses and can evoke responses in OB neurons.</s><s>We then use in vivo two-photon time-lapse imaging to show that mature OSNs retain a high level of activity-dependent synaptic reorganization, even in the adult OB.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Immature OSNs form synapses with OB neurons.</s><s>To investigate the relationship between OSN maturity and synaptogenesis, we specifically labelled the axons and presynaptic terminals of either immature or mature OSNs using the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>tTA expression was driven either by Gg8, which is expressed in immature, basally located OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>), or by OMP, an established marker for mature OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>These driver lines were crossed with a tetO-synaptophysinGFP-tdTomato reporter line <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , in which simultaneous expression of cytosolic tdTomato (tdTom) and GFP tagged-synaptophysin (sypGFP) are controlled by a tetracycline-responsive promoter, to generate Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom and OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice.</s><s>In the olfactory epithelium of 8-week-old mice, we found that 98% of Gg8 þ OSNs expressing tdTom co-stained for GAP43, another widely used marker for immature OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , while 6% also co-stained for OMP.</s><s>Hence, we refer to Gg8 þ OSNs as 'immature', while noting that a small subset of Gg8 þ /OMP þ OSNs are likely at an intermediate stage, that is, in transition to maturity.</s><s>In 3-week-old OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice, we observed mature OSNs densely innervating the OB, along with strong expression of sypGFP concentrated in the glomerular layer (GL) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, immature OSN axons in Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom mice also contained sypGFP and in some cases formed glomerular-like structures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>In 8-week-old mice, expression patterns of both reporters were similar to those in younger mice, but there were fewer immature OSN axons innervating the OB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>), consistent with Gg8 expression being limited to the regenerating OSN population at this age <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>At higher resolution, expression of sypGFP in individual Gg8 þ axons was punctate and colocalized with axonal varicosities in the GL (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>), indicative of synapse formation.</s><s>In contrast, in the olfactory nerve layer, which lacks synapses, only smaller sypGFP puncta, which likely correspond to transport packets, were visible in the immature axons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, sypGFP expression in OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice was punctate in the GL, with smaller transport packets in the olfactory nerve layer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>We verified the specificity of sypGFP labelling of synaptic puncta by immunostaining OB sections from 8-week-old Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom and OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice and examining the GL.</s><s>This showed that 97.5% of OSN presynaptic terminals in tdTomato-expressing axons, as identified by SV2 staining, contained sypGFP (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Hence, analysis of sypGFP puncta encompasses the vast majority of OSN presynaptic terminals.</s><s>We also found 496% colocalization of sypGFP puncta with synaptophysin staining and 89% colocalization with apposed PSD-95 staining (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D-E</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>This indicates that the majority of sypGFP clusters form synapses.</s><s>The remaining 11% of PSD-95-negative sypGFP clusters likely represent a combination of sypGFP transport packets, and synapses in the process of formation or elimination.</s></p><p><s>A small subset of Gg8-tdTom OSNs co-stain for OMP, and hence are in transition to maturity.</s><s>It was therefore important to determine what contribution these Gg8 þ /OMP þ OSNs make to the axons innervating the OB in Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom mice.</s><s>We found 8.9% colocalization between tdTom and OMP, and 6.5% colocalization between sypGFP and OMP, in the GL of OB sections from Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom mice immunostained for OMP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1j</ref>,k and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The slightly higher colocalization in axons in the GL compared with OSNs in the olfactory epithelium is not surprising, since the youngest Gg8 þ OSNs are likely to have short axons that have yet to reach the GL.</s><s>Of the Gg8 þ /OMP-axons in the GL of Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom mice, 78% contained sypGFP puncta that colocalized with varicosities (n ¼ 71 axons from eight mice).</s><s>The remaining 22% of Gg8-tdTom axons that lack sypGFP puncta likely represent an earlier stage of OSN maturation, where OSN axons have entered the GL but have yet to form synapses.</s><s>Together, these analyses confirm that while a small subset of Gg8 þ axons and the presynaptic terminals that they form are also OMP þ , these are a minor contributor to the total population of glomerular axons expressing Gg8-tTA-driven reporters.</s></p><p><s>To examine immature OSN axons in the GL of 8-week-old Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom mice at the ultrastructural level, we performed immunogold anti-GFP staining and transmission electron microscopy.</s><s>The anti-GFP antibody that we used detected 98.7% of sypGFP puncta, with no false positives at the light level (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), and specifically labelled a subset of presynaptic boutons by electron microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>We found that immature OSN axons do form asymmetric synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> : immunogold-labelled axonal boutons contained presynaptic vesicles apposed to a postsynaptic density across a synaptic cleft (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, these synapses were structurally similar to synapses formed by both mature OSNs in OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice, and adjacent unlabelled synapses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c-e</ref>).</s><s>Although the identity of the presynaptic and postsynaptic structures forming these unlabelled synapses is unknown, the compartmentalization of glomerular neuropil <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> makes it likely that they are also axodendritic OSN-OB neuron synapses.</s><s>Hence, we concluded that immature OSNs can form synapses in the OB.</s></p><p><s>Gc8 þ OSNs can evoke OB neuron firing.</s><s>For the synapses formed by immature OSNs to play a functional role in olfaction, they must be capable of transmitting information to OB neurons.</s><s>To investigate this question, we generated a tetO-ChIEF-Citrine mouse line, which expresses the high-conductance, slowly inactivating channelrhodopsin variant ChIEF <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> fused to the yellow fluorescent protein Citrine under control of a tetracyclineresponsive promoter (Methods).</s><s>By crossing this line to the Gg8-tTA driver line, we produced specific expression of ChIEF-Citrine in immature OSNs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A-C</ref>).</s><s>In the olfactory epithelium of 3-week-old Gg8-ChIEF-Citrine mice, close to the age at which the greatest number of Gg8 þ OSNs are present <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , we found that 99% of Gg8 þ OSNs expressing Citrine colocalized with GAP43, while only 6% of Gg8 þ OSNs also expressed OMP (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>Of these Gg8 þ /OMP þ OSNs, 86% also expressed GAP43.</s><s>Therefore, as in the Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom line, the vast majority of Gg8 þ OSNs are immature and do not express OMP, while a small subset express both immature and mature markers (Gg8 þ / GAP43 þ /OMP þ ), likely representing a transition stage.</s><s>OSNs migrate apically from the basal lamina as they mature.</s><s>We therefore determined the position of individual Gg8 þ and GAP43 þ OSNs along the basal-apical axis of the olfactory epithelium as an approximate indicator of their maturity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>The ranges of positions along the basal-apical axis were identical for Gg8 þ and GAP43 þ OSNs (both 5-79%).</s><s>However, the distribution of Gg8 þ OSNs (median (inter-quartile range): 47 (36-58) %) was skewed towards slightly more apical positions than that of GAP43 þ OSNs (40 (29-52) %; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>), indicating that Gg8 is expressed slightly later in the maturation process than GAP43.</s></p><p><s>We then performed in vivo multi-electrode recording combined with optogenetic photoactivation in 3-week-old Gg8-ChIEF-Citrine mice using a multi-channel optrode, which spanned the entire OB from the dorsolateral to the ventromedial side (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>We found that photoactivation with 473 nm light elicited robust time-locked firing of OB neurons for at least one electrode site in five out of six recorded Gg8-ChIEF-Citrine mice.</s></p><p><s>For the example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e-i</ref>, the change in multi-unit firing rate, calculated as the difference in mean firing rate during the 3 s light pulse relative to the preceding 3s baseline, was significant for the mitral cell layer (MCL) and both electrodes in the external plexiform layer (EPLs and EPLd).</s><s>Across all six mice, photoactivation induced a significant increase in multi-unit firing frequency in the GL, external plexiform layer (EPLs and EPLd) and MCL of the OB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E-H</ref>, Methods).</s><s>Photoactivation-induced firing was excitation wavelength-specific (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3I</ref>), and firing rate was dependent on excitation power (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E-H</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, photoactivation in age-matched tetO-ChIEF-Citrine control mice did not evoke a significant change in firing rate in any OB layer (three mice, 4150 total trials per mouse, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E-H</ref>).</s><s>Hence, we concluded that immature OSNs are capable of evoking functional responses in OB neurons.</s></p><p><s>Rapid turnover of OSN presynaptic terminals.</s><s>We next asked whether the synapses formed by OSNs are stable or dynamic.</s><s>The structural plasticity of primary sensory synapses has not previously been investigated.</s><s>On the one hand, one might intuitively expect a primary sensory synapse, whose role is simply to relay information, to be relatively stable.</s><s>On the other hand, synapse formation and elimination are known to be key plasticity mechanisms in many brain regions, including the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>If synaptogenesis is restricted solely to initial incorporation of an OSN into the glomerular circuit, then sensory input can be altered only by death and replacement of OSNs.</s><s>However, if synapses can be formed and eliminated throughout the lifespan of an OSN, this plasticity would enable rapid and ongoing adaptation to changes in sensory experience.</s></p><p><s>To investigate this question, we developed a robust assay to quantify structural remodelling of synapses formed by OSNs.</s><s>We implanted cranial windows over the dorsal surface of the OB of 3-week-old Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom and OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), and used in vivo two-photon microscopy to repeatedly image presynaptic terminals formed by either immature or mature OSN axons throughout entire glomeruli (Supplementary Movies 1,2).</s><s>Since maturation-related changes in reporter expression and OSN replacement could affect structural synaptic remodelling of OSN inputs over days to weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , we sought to minimize this contribution and thus confined our imaging experiments to a single 3 h session, during which each glomerulus was imaged at 30 min intervals.</s><s>This approach enabled us to perform longitudinal three-dimensional (3D) tracking of sypGFP puncta in two-photon z-stacks, which are a proxy for OSN presynaptic terminals (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C-E</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref> and Methods).</s></p><p><s>We first examined turnover of OSN presynaptic terminals, which is a widely used metric for quantifying structural plasticity (Methods) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Turnover comprises both formation of new presynaptic terminals and of existing presynaptic terminals, thereby providing a measure of the total change during the 3 h imaging session.</s><s>However, turnover does not imply direct replacement, as gain and loss can occur at completely independent locations.</s><s>We found that in 3-week-old mice, immature OSN presynaptic terminals exhibited a very high level of turnover (26.5±15.3%;</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>), consistent with them being in the process of wiring into glomerular circuits.</s><s>Surprisingly, however, mature OSN presynaptic terminals also underwent a significant level of turnover within 3 h (11.3 ± 5.0%; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>), although this turnover rate was 2.35-fold lower than that of immature OSN presynaptic terminals.</s></p><p><s>Since some glomeruli continue to mature into the second postnatal month <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , we repeated our imaging experiments in 8-week-old mice to determine whether structural plasticity of OSN presynaptic terminals exhibits a developmental critical period.</s><s>Interestingly, we found that turnover rates for both immature (22.2 ± 13.2%) and mature (12.0 ± 5.5%) OSN presynaptic terminals were very similar in 8-week-old mice to those in 3-week-old mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>, see above) suggesting that this high level of structural plasticity continues into adulthood.</s></p><p><s>Although our analysis of turnover clearly demonstrates a high level of plasticity, this metric includes only those sypGFP puncta present during the first and/or last imaging session and so may not provide a complete picture of the dynamics of structural remodelling.</s><s>Therefore, we utilized the information captured by imaging at 30 min intervals to assess the changes in OSN presynaptic terminals with greater temporal resolution.</s><s>Rates of both formation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>) and elimination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>) of sypGFP puncta were higher for immature than mature OSNs, but again did not differ between 3-week-old and 8-week-old mice.</s><s>Interestingly, formation of new sypGFP puncta and elimination of existing sypGFP puncta occurred at similar rates within each genotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>; gain versus loss P ¼ 0.65, immature versus mature Po0.001, interaction P ¼ 0.82; two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), data for 3-week-and 8-week-old mice pooled).</s><s>Similarly, there was no systematic difference in the rates of sypGFP puncta gain and loss for individual glomeruli (P ¼ 0.62, paired t-test of all data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>), implying a steady-state level of presynaptic terminal turnover.</s><s>Importantly, control experiments demonstrated that the high level of structural plasticity that we measured for OSN presynaptic terminals was not an artefact of our imaging protocol (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our data demonstrate rapid and continuous structural plasticity of sensory input to the OB into adulthood.</s></p><p><s>The precise timeline for the formation of a functional OSN synapse is unknown; however, studies of cultured hippocampal neurons suggest that synapse formation can occur in as little as 1 h (refs 33-35).</s><s>Since we could not directly determine the lifetime of all of the sypGFP puncta that we imaged, we decided to track the survival of new sypGFP puncta that appeared during the first hour of our imaging session.</s><s>We found that over 90% of newly formed sypGFP puncta across all experimental groups persisted for at least one hour, and over 75% persisted for two hours or longer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Hence, the majority of sypGFP puncta that were gained or lost during the 3 h imaging session had lifetimes greater than one hour, and were apposed to a PSD-95 punctum (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), therefore they very likely correspond to synaptic structures.</s><s>Furthermore, because the probability of stabilization of a newly formed sypGFP punctum was similar for immature and mature OSN axons, this suggests that the large differences in their structural dynamics arises from increased rates of formation and elimination of Gg8-sypGFP puncta.</s></p><p><s>Turnover of OSN presynaptic terminals is activity-dependent.</s></p><p><s>Rapid and continuous turnover of OSN presynaptic terminals may enable optimization of glomerular circuitry to changes in sensory experience.</s><s>Therefore, we next investigated the role of sensory activity in OSN presynaptic terminal turnover by performing unilateral naris occlusion in Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom and OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>).</s><s>Naris occlusion was maintained for 3 weeks, ending at 8 weeks of age.</s><s>We found that this naris occlusion protocol decreased ipsilateral OB size by 17±3% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) but had no effect on the number of tdTom-expressing neurons in the olfactory epithelium of either line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>), or on total numbers of OSNs, proliferating or apoptotic cells in the olfactory epithelium (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure"

responses in OB neurons.</s><s>Second, we show that OSNs not only undergo rapid synaptogenesis as they integrate into adult OB circuits but also maintain a high level of activitydependent structural plasticity once they have matured.</s><s>This provides a strategy for continuous re-optimization of OB circuitry, which acts on a much faster timescale than production of new OSNs.</s></p><p><s>Our EM data show that immature OSNs form synapses with very similar structural properties to those formed by their mature counterparts.</s><s>This finding is consistent with a previous electrophysiological study showing that the presynaptic properties of OSN inputs remain constant as they mature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>However, it was not previously recognized that many of the newly-formed synapses were in fact made by immature OSNs.</s></p><p><s>We then asked whether the synapses formed by immature OSNs are functional, and found that optogenetic photoactivation of Gg8-expressing axons evoked robust firing of OB neurons.</s><s>Although there is a slight possibility that ChIEF-mediated depolarization of Gg8 þ axons is transmitted to neighbouring mature OSN axons via ephaptic coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , the most parsimonious explanation for optogenetically evoked responses in Gg8-ChIEF-Citrine mice is that newly generated Gg8 þ OSNs can form functional synapses, which release glutamate and thereby depolarize their postsynaptic targets.</s><s>6.5% of Gg8-sypGFP puncta colocalize with OMP; hence, a small proportion of the Gg8 þ OSNs that form synapses are already in transition to maturity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that these Gg8 þ /OMP þ synapses could account for the optogenetically evoked firing of OB neurons.</s><s>Nevertheless, our data suggest that OSNs begin to play a functional role earlier in their maturation process than previously thought.</s><s>Accordingly, a recent study provided strong evidence that OSNs express odorant receptors two days prior to the onset of OMP expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Hence, OSNs that still express immature markers may be capable of detecting odours, which in combination with our data, suggests a new and previously unappreciated role for newly generated

stem cells indicated that OSN axons do not enter the GL until 8 days after terminal cell division, concluding that synapse formation is not required for OMP expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>These studies raise interesting questions about gauging OSN maturation with respect to different developmental markers and stages of axon development, further highlighting the need for investigation of OSN synaptogenesis.</s><s>Definitively determining the temporal relationship between synapse formation and OMP expression in individual OSNs will require multi-day time-lapse imaging of sparsely-labelled OSN axons expressing distinct reporters under the control of both immature and mature OSN-specific promoters.</s></p><p><s>It is perhaps surprising that a primary sensory synapse, in this case providing the sole source of sensory input to the main OB, would undergo rapid and continuous structural remodelling.</s><s>Indeed, the level of synapse turnover exhibited by mature OSN presynaptic terminals is significantly greater than that of excitatory synapses in other regions of the adult brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref>

to glomerular circuits is maintained.</s><s>The answer may lie in regulating the balance of this turnover: first, the rates of formation and elimination of sypGFP puncta are very similar, suggesting that the number of synapses per glomerulus remains relatively stable.</s><s>Second, a recurring theme in other sensory brain regions is the existence of subpopulations of synaptic structures with different lifetimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> .</s><s>If this were also true of mature OSN presynaptic

role during circuit formation (and in the case of the OB, incorporation of newborn neurons into existing circuits) by enabling selection, refinement and error correction.</s><s>Hence, transient pre-or postsynaptic structures may represent those that fail to locate a synaptic partner, or form inappropriate connections that are rapidly eliminated.</s><s>This may explain why immature OSN presynaptic terminals are formed and eliminated more rapidly than their mature counterparts (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Alternatively, these transient synaptic structures may represent short-lived synaptic contacts that temporarily contribute to network function <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , or play other roles such as promoting axon branch stabilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Whatever the role of transient synaptic structures, ongoing synapse formation and elimination endows OB circuits

week <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Our naris occlusion experiments were designed to assess the effects of a long-term reduction in olfactory input.</s><s>OSN presynaptic terminal turnover is likely to have reached a new steady-state level after three weeks of naris occlusion.</s><s>Hence, the reduction in both formation and loss of OSN presynaptic terminals is likely due to a combination of loss of odour-evoked activity and longer-term compensatory plasticity.</s><s>Although it remains to be determined how rapidly OSN presynaptic terminal turnover is affected by naris occlusion, it is clear that the marked reduction in OSN presynaptic terminal turnover elicited by 3 weeks of naris occlusion was not a consequence of changes at the level of the olfactory epithelium, as we found no effect of naris occlusion on numbers of immature or mature OSNs, or proliferating or apoptotic cells.</s><s>This is in agreement with a recent study, which found no change in epithelium thickness, total number of OSNs or number of OMP þ OSNs at time points 3-28 days post naris occlusion in adult mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>Hence, a transient effect of naris occlusion on OSN survival is also unlikely.</s></p><p><s>It is possible that the level of OSN presynaptic terminal turnover differs between anaesthetised and awake mice.</s><s>Our imaging experiments were performed in mice lightly anaesthetized with sevoflurane, a GABA A receptor agonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , and dexmedetomidine, an a 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist.</s><s>OSN presynaptic terminals are glutamatergic, and there is no reported evidence that they express either GABA A or a 2 -adrenergic receptors; hence, the anaesthetic agents used here are unlikely to have a direct pharmacological effect on OSN synapses.</s><s>We used sevoflurane specifically because it is a weak odorant <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> ; nevertheless, odour-evoked firing rates of mitral/tufted cells are significantly lower in sevoflurane-anaesthetised than awake mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>Whether sevoflurane-mediated suppression of odourevoked activity might affect OSN presynaptic terminal turnover is unclear, but given that chronic naris occlusion dramatically reduced OSN presynaptic terminal turnover, sevoflurane is more likely to suppress than to accelerate the turnover of OSN presynaptic terminals.</s><s>Future studies could directly assess the rate of OSN presynaptic terminal turnover in awake mice.</s></p><p><s>Why invoke synapse turnover rather than other forms of plasticity?</s><s>OSN presynaptic terminals have a uniformly very high presynaptic release probability, which does not differ between newly formed and long-standing synapses, or with the identity of the postsynaptic target <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>Hence, OSN presynaptic terminals appear to have a limited functional dynamic range, and consequently, structural remodelling may be necessary in order to effect significant plasticity at the level of OB sensory input.</s><s>In addition, synapse formation and elimination can rapidly alter the connectivity of glomerular circuits.</s><s>OSNs are known to provide monosynaptic input to both principal neurons and at least two classes of periglomerular interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>

processing and plasticity in the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>Although OSN regeneration is vital for ongoing maintenance of olfactory function and recovery from damage to the olfactory epithelium or olfactory nerve <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> , it does not enable rapid or fine-scale tuning of OB circuitry.</s><s>For example, a recent study found that the synaptic output of OSNs, measured at the resolution of individual glomeruli, increased as a result of fear learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>These changes occurred within 3 days, too fast to be accounted for by incorporation of newborn OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>However, activity-dependent formation and elimination of OSN synapses could be used to adjust glomerular connectivity and thus provide a cellular mechanism for this type of experience-induced plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref>

points.</s><s>For each ROI, identical laser power and detector gain settings were used for each time point.</s><s>ROIs were 60-180 mm in z.</s><s>GFP emission was collected at 500-550 nm, and tdTom emission at 4600 nm.</s><s>Control experiments imaging single fluorochromes showed no cross-talk between channels.</s><s>Fluorescence levels were adjusted to maximize use of the dynamic range, without saturation.</s><s>In CaMKIIa-sypGFP-tdTom mice, ROIs of the same size as for OB imaging were selected at random.</s></p><p><s>In a subset of imaged mice, a short-term time-lapse image series was acquired to assess the possible contribution of motion artefacts arising from breathing and/or blood vessel pulsation to measurements of synapse turnover (Figs 5b,c,6h,i and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>This image series consisted of four high-resolution images of entire glomeruli acquired as described above, but at 3 min intervals.</s></p><p><s>We performed two additional control experiments.</s><s>First, to exclude the possibility that imaging at 30 min intervals induced structural plasticity, we performed a control imaging experiment in two P21-22 OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>Surgery and the first imaging time point were exactly as described above.</s><s>Mice were then removed from the stereotaxic apparatus, received 1 mg kg À 1 atipamezole and a bolus of warmed lactated Ringer's solution and were returned to their home cage (containing their mother and littermates) with a heat pad.</s><s>These mice were ambulatory within 5 min of atipamezole administration, and remained in their home cage for B2.5 h, where they were observed to explore their cage and interact normally with littermates.</s><s>They were then lightly anaesthetized with 0.5 mg kg À 1 dexdomitor (s.c.) in lactated Ringer's solution and 1% sevoflurane in O 2 (1 l min À 1 ) for a second imaging session, which occurred exactly 3 h after the first.</s><s>Second, in two 8-week-old OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice, we used a thinned skull preparation instead of performing a craniotomy (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>).</s><s>A B1 mm diameter region over the right OB was thinned with a microsurgical blade to a final thickness of 20-30 mm.</s><s>Imaging was then performed exactly as for mice with implanted cranial windows, but using PBS as the immersion medium for the objective lens.</s></p><p><s>Naris occlusion.</s><s>Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom (n ¼ 5) and OMP-sypGFP-tdTom (n ¼ 6) mice underwent naris occlusion at 5 weeks of age by inserting a small plug into the right naris under brief isoflurane anaesthesia.</s><s>Naris occlusion continued for 3 weeks, such that mice were 8 weeks old on the day of imaging (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>After 3 weeks of naris occlusion, and prior to cranial window implantation, the integrity of the block was confirmed by the absence of bubbles in a drop of water placed over the occluded naris.</s><s>The effectiveness of blockade was further confirmed in perfusion-fixed tissue from each mouse by reduced size of the right OB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) and in a subset of mice, by reduced OB tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the right OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> .</s><s>OB size was measured for three Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom and three OMP-sypGFP-tdTom mice, as the surface area of the left and right OB for three coronal sections per mouse, located B25, 50 and 75% along the anterior-posterior axis.</s><s>The mean of these values for each mouse is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>.</s><s>A two-way ANOVA showed no effect of genotype on OB size (effect of genotype, P ¼ 0.63; effect of occlusion, Po0.001; interaction, P ¼ 0.37).</s><s>Because of their density and highly branched structure, it was not possible to directly quantify the effect of naris occlusion on the number of OSN axons innervating individual glomeruli.</s><s>We instead used the percentage of each glomerulus occupied by OMP-tdTomato axons or OMP-sypGFP puncta, as proxy measures.</s><s>The percentage of the glomerulus occupied by tdTomato or GFP signal was measured in single confocal optical sections as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>Two-photon image analysis.</s><s>All image analysis was performed in Fiji <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>Data analysis was performed blind to the genotype, age and experimental condition (naris occlusion versus control) of the mouse.</s><s>Custom-written macros were used to generate an automated, unbiased image-processing pipeline.</s><s>For each region of interest, images at all time points were first realigned using the 'Correct 3D Drift' plugin, which permits only linear translations of the entire image in x, y and/or z.</s><s>The tdTomato channel was used as the reference for realignment.</s><s>Images were median filtered (two pixel radius), and sypGFP puncta were detected in 3D using an a `trous wavelet decomposition at three length scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> and a hard threshold t ¼ s.d.O(2ln(number of pixels) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> was applied.</s><s>'3D Objects Counter' was then used to index and label sypGFP puncta for manual tracking over time.</s><s>The centres of individual sypGFP puncta analysed changed by o0.5 mm between time points, relative to fiducial points along the axon.</s><s>The variance in quantification of OSN presynaptic terminal turnover was 1.42±1.48%</s><s>(mean±s.d.) between different analysers, and hence could not explain the differences between experimental groups that we report.</s><s>Turnover was defined as ([n gain þ n lost ]/[n t0 þ n t3h ]) and reported as a percentage; survival fraction (SF) was defined as SF t ¼ n t /n 0h (ref.</s><s>31).</s><s>Analysis of turnover, gain, loss and survival fraction included only those sypGFP puncta present for at least two consecutive time points, in order to minimize any possible contribution of sypGFP transport packets.</s><s>We typically analysed one to two glomeruli per mouse.</s><s>We confirmed that the density of sypGFP puncta, which was higher in OMP-sypGFP-tdTom than in Gg8-sypGFP-tdTom mice, did not affect detection of individual puncta or quantification of their turnover (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F-H</ref>).</s><s>Linear manipulations of image brightness and contrast were performed for display purposes only.</s></p><p><s>We performed an additional test to determine whether formation and elimination of sypGFP puncta was independent of the threshold used for object segmentation.</s><s>For a subset of images, we repeated the automatic object detection, but using a twofold lower threshold, and tracked the detected sypGFP puncta over the 3 h imaging session.</s><s>We then made a pairwise comparison with the original tracking data for individual sypGFP puncta in these images.</s><s>We found that the measurements of turnover, gain and loss were identical between the two thresholds.</s><s>Indeed, the only minor discrepancy between the two data sets was that 1/218 puncta was lost 30 min later with the lower threshold.</s><s>Hence, sypGFP puncta dynamics were largely independent of the intensity threshold employed during automatic object detection, and the one discrepancy that we identified makes a minimal contribution given the large magnitude differences between experimental groups that we report (Figs 5a-c,6h-j).</s></p><p><s>Statistics.</s><s>All data were normally distributed with equal variance.</s><s>Data are described as mean ± s.d.</s><s>unless otherwise stated, and were compared using Student's t-test or one-or two-way ANOVA using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 | Specific labelling of
