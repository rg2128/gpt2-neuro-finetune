coarse P100 sandpaper as go-texture vs. smooth P1200 sandpaper as no-go-texture; Methods).</s><s>Once task performance reached expert level (discriminability index (d') &gt; 1.5; Methods), we implemented a 'rule-switch' by reversing stimulus-reward contingency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Mice reached high d' values during initial learning (from 'learning naïve', LN, through 'learning expert', LE), decreased performance after reversal, and regained high d' values after re-learning the task (from 'reversal naïve', RN, through 'reversal expert', RE) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, n = 11 mice).</s></p><p><s>Reversal learning was significantly faster than the initial learning and the performance remained stable over weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Task performance depended on sensory input and was independent of initial go-texture (n = 3 mice trained first on P1200 texture; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Mice developed anticipatory whisking as well as well-timed licking during initial learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> .</s><s>Following the rule-switch, the overall whisking kinematics did not change as they maintained the whisking-for-touch strategy but transiently reverted to uncertain and delayed licking before regaining confidence in the RE period (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We focused on two cortical areas implicated in task-learning: barrel cortex in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which is important for tactile discrimination and sensory learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> , and the lateral OFC, for its role in credit-assignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>To examine the behavioural and causal relevance of these two areas, we expressed inhibitory DREADD receptors (hM4Di) in excitatory neurons in either S1 or lateral OFC (for histology and electrophysiological validation, see Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Inhibition of S1 neurons during initial training (via daily CNO injections before each behavioural training sessions during LN and LE periods) prevented mice from learning the discrimination task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, inhibiting neurons in the lateral OFC, but not medial OFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , after the rule-switch (during RN and RE periods) impaired reversal learning and increased perseverative errors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f-g</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, lateral OFC-silenced mice were still able to learn a new stimulus-outcome association after introduction of a novel P600 sandpaper as rewarded go-texture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s><s>Overall, these results indicate a dissociation of neural mechanisms of learning and reversal learning distributed across cortical areas involving the S1 and lateral OFC, respectively.</s></p><p><s>To directly probe neuronal activity in lateral OFC and S1 during learning and reversal learning, we performed in vivo two-photon Ca 2+ imaging in transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6f in superficial excitatory layer (L)2/3 neurons.</s><s>We targeted lateral OFC, which resides deep in the frontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14</ref> , by imaging via a gradientindex lens that was inserted through a chronically implanted cannula (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>; Methods, n = 4 mice).</s><s>Cannula-implanted mice showed no noticeable impairments in whisking and in simple behavioural tests (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>We observed large Ca 2+ transients in lateral OFC neurons with trial-related activity especially during the reward-outcome window (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>An example neuron that was longitudinally measured across all behavioural phases displayed large and robust Ca 2+ responses to the unexpected rewards for the new go-texture after the rule-switch (RN), whereas only a modest increase in reward-related activity was found during initial learning (LE) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>This high RN activity was transient and decreased as the task performance increased during the RE period.</s><s>The same response pattern was evident when averaging across all OFC neurons, with a significant increase in reward-related Ca 2+ transient amplitude after the rule-switch (LEàRN; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>These findings are consistent with lateral OFC developing a representation of outcome-value that is strongly visible upon rule-switch <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15</ref> .</s><s>In line with this notion, OFC neuronal responses to a third texture type (P600), associated with a constant small reward both before and after reversal, remained unchanged in control experiments (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>In stark contrast, L2/3 neurons in S1, imaged through a chronic cranial window (n = 5 mice), exhibited abundant Ca 2+ activity during both the stimulus-presentation as well as the reward-outcome window (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>Rewarded go-texture-related Ca 2+ transients emerged during initial task-learning (LNàLE), decreased directly after the rule-switch, and re-appeared for the new gotexture in the RE period (an example neuron in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>This response remapping was also observed when averaging across all S1 L2/3 neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>Notably, similar response profile was also found in anatomically identified S1àOFC projection neurons targeted via a dual viral labelling strategy (n = 3 mice; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Together with neural responses, the fraction of active neurons was highest for LE and RN phases in the lateral OFC and LE and RE phases in S1, suggesting strong involvement and dissociation of the two regions in these respective salient behavioural phases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> and<ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Taking advantage of longitudinal activity measurements from the same neurons across weeks, we further examined the heterogeneity of neuronal responses in lateral OFC and S1 and their stability or flexibility upon rule-switch.</s><s>A key question is whether neurons which preferentially respond to hit-trials after initial learning will retain response selectivity for the new or the old go-texture after reversal, i.e. whether they remain more stimulus-selective or outcome-selective.</s><s>To quantify response selectivity of active neurons, we defined an ROC-based hit/CR selectivity index (SI) that ranges from -1 and +1 (significance tested by permutation test, p &lt; 0.05; Methods; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref> .</s><s>We focused on hit/CR SI values for the reward-outcome window.</s><s>Note that the hit/CR SI per se cannot distinguish between stimulus-and outcome-selectivity because these trial-types differ in both texture-type and action-outcome.</s><s>However, by comparing SI values before and after the ruleswitch we can reveal whether a neuron's new-hit/CR SI reverses sign (indicating stimulus-selectivity) or remains similar (indicating outcome-selectivity). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> schematically plots the 5 major classes of SI changes that can be illustrated in a 2D before-after plot.</s><s>Note that each neuron may show a mixture of stimulus-and outcome-selectivity, which are given by the projection components onto the two diagonals.</s><s>We consider here only the major classes.</s><s>To not only assess how neurons immediately react to the rule-switch but also how they may adapt during re-learning of the task, we assigned each neuron twice to these classes of SI changes (comparing LEàRN and LEààRE, respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Among 107 chronically imaged lateral OFC neurons (n = 3 mice), we found a high fraction of outcomeselective neurons, which tracked outcome-value by responding strongly in the newhit trials immediately following rule-switch in the RN period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b-c</ref>).</s><s>Some OFC neurons also lost selectivity while others gained selectivity.</s><s>This functional selectivity for the new go-texture (LEààRE), we did not observe such recruitment for S1 neurons in lateral OFC-silenced mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>; Methods).</s><s>This analysis further confirms that S1 remapping crucially depends on top-down OFC input.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we examined the mechanism of how lateral OFC governs S1 remapping by analysing the influence of error-modulation and history-dependence.</s></p><p><s>Most lateral OFC neurons that responded strongly to new-hit trials also displayed enhanced response in FA trials in early phases of reversal (RN) indicating the errordependent nature of OFC computation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d-e</ref>).</s><s>Since OFC neurons integrate recent reward-history <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref> , we also studied intrinsic features of value-sensitive neurons in both lateral OFC and S1.</s><s>We computed a 'reward-history modulation index' (RHMI) for each neuronal subclass by comparing responses of each of the 'hit' trials that were immediately preceded by a 'hit' or an 'FA' trial (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>; Methods).</s><s>While outcome-selective neurons in the lateral OFC showed a significant reward-historydependent response modulation before (LE) and after (RN) the rule-switch, S1 neurons with both outcome-selectivity and acquired-selectivity, but no other subclasses, were modulated by reward-history in RE.</s><s>Interestingly, historydependent modulation was absent in S1 neurons in OFC-silenced mice indicating that higher-order top-down input from the lateral OFC is critical for the intrinsic functional reorganisation of both outcome-selective and gain-selectivity neurons in S1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>).</s><s>These findings corroborate the notion that encoding of outcome-value in the lateral OFC, as well as deviations from expected outcome-value, is critical for functional remapping of a selective subpopulation of S1 neurons for flexible decision-making.</s></p><p><s>Adaptive behaviour is shaped by recent and accumulated sensory evidences, as well as predicted outcome-value of future choices.</s><s>Predictive processing is critical for perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref> and the OFC provides a 'cognitive map' functioning as an internal reference framework to compare and optimise a desired behavioural outcome such as reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> .</s><s>Reward value is computed in distributed parts of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref> including the VTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23</ref> , frontal areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , and primary and associational <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> sensory areas of the neocortex.</s><s>Our experiments revealed a crucial role of mouse lateral OFC neurons in encoding outcome-value prediction error as a teaching signal for driving learning of an altered stimulus-reward contingency, partly resembling classical dopamine responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35</ref> .</s><s>Tracking both positive and negative outcome-values, OFC neurons may represent ongoing neural estimates of position on a value map <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Pharmacogenetic silencing revealed that lateral OFC has a critical causal role in implementing flexibility as previously shown in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25</ref> , as compared to non-human primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26</ref> .</s><s>This implementation could be achieved via possible projection-specific interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27</ref> with integrative cortical areas like the retrosplenial cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28</ref> , and/or subcortical structures including the basolateral amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29</ref> and the mediodorsal thalamus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30</ref> .</s><s>Our findings also crucially imply that S1 neurons do not simply function as sensory feature detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31</ref> .</s><s>Whereas reward-sensitive neurons were to be expected in the higher-order cortex such as OFC, perhaps more importantly, we discovered a subpopulation of neurons in the primary sensory cortex that are differentially modulated by reward-history.</s><s>The cellular and circuit mechanisms for a remarkable plasticity in this small subset of neurons, possibly involving neuromodulators such as serotonin <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32</ref> or long-range layer-specific excitatory and local inhibitory interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33</ref> , remain to be determined.</s><s>The existence of a reward-valence signal in the primary sensory cortex and their modulation by higher-order inputs has important implications for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms for brain machine interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, this study revealed crucial cellular-level local interactive motifs and long-range circuit interactions behind adaptive plasticity and flexible decision-making.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 | Lateral OFC-dependent reversal learning in a texture-discrimination task.</s><s>a, Top: A schematic diagram of experimental setup.</s><s>Bottom: Trial structure and types of trial outcome (CR, correct rejection;
