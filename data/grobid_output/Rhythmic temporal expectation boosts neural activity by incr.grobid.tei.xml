consequently, different dipole orientations associated with neural activity evoked by different tone frequencies should translate into systematic variability in M/EEG amplitude.</s><s>To test whether M/EEG amplitude covaries with pure tone frequency, we epoched M/EEG data from 200 ms before to 400 ms after each pure tone onset.</s><s>The epochs were averaged for each tone frequency and smoothed with a 20 ms moving average window.</s><s>The smoothing applied an effective low-pass frequency cutoff at Ï³20 Hz, implemented to ensure that the time series of M/EEG activity evoked by each given tone are not dominated by sharp peaks of responses evoked by consecutive tones presented at ISI rates of Ï³23-43 Hz.</s><s>M/EEG time series smoothing has also been shown to improve subsequent decoding accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Grootswagers et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>This resulted in 15 time series of mean M/EEG amplitude per participant and channel.</s><s>Spearman's rankorder correlation coefficients were calculated per participant, channel, and time point between the mean M/EEG amplitude and tone frequency (specifically, with a monotonic vector in which the lowest frequency was assigned the lowest value and the highest frequency to the highest value).</s><s>Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients were chosen as they capture any monotonic relation between variables.</s><s>To establish whether different M/EEG channel types (EEG electrodes, MEG magnetometers, and planar gradiometers) contain signals sensitive to the frequency of presented pure tones, the grand-average channel-by-time matrices of correlation coefficients between M/EEG amplitude and tone frequency were decomposed into principal modes using singular value decomposition.</s><s>Per channel type, a set of principal modes (EEG: 7 modes of 60 original channels; magnetometers: 7 modes of 102 original channels; gradiometers: 11 modes of 204 original channels) explaining Ï¾95% of the original variance was retained.</s><s>This form of principal component analysis-based data dimensionality reduction has been shown to substantially improve the accuracy of M/EEG multivariate decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Grootswagers et al., 2017)</ref>, used in subsequent analysis steps (see below).</s><s>The corresponding component weights were applied to individual participants' channel-by-time coefficient matrices and averaged.</s><s>The resulting time series-effectively summarizing the individual participants' correlation time series across channels-were analyzed using cluster-based permutation tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Maris and Oostenveld, 2007)</ref>, which are an established method of analyzing M/EEG data, without making any assumptions about the normality of data distribution, while correcting for multiple comparison over time.</s><s>Specifically, single-participant data were entered per channel type into separate cluster-based permutation one-sample t tests (which do not rely on any assumptions about the underlying data distribution), while correcting for multiple comparisons over time at a cluster-based threshold ( p Ï½ 0.05).</s></p><p><s>While several other studies found monotonic effects on EEG amplitude (especially for frequencies Ï¾500 Hz) at both early (tens of milliseconds: Tabachnick and Toscano, 2018) and late (hundreds of milliseconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">: Picton et al., 1978)</ref> latencies, nonmonotonic effects of tone frequency on EEG amplitude have also been reported (e.g., a quadratic relationship between tone frequency and N1 amplitude: <ref type="bibr">Herrmann et al., 2013a)</ref>.</s><s>Although a visual inspection of our data suggested a primarily monotonic relationship between tone frequency and M/EEG amplitude (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>), we have also tested for quadratic effects in the data.</s><s>To this end, we have repeated the analysis described above, this time correlating M/EEG amplitudes with a vector representing the frequency axis quadratically (whereby the lowest and highest frequencies were assigned the highest value, and the medium frequency the lowest value).</s><s>The remaining steps (principal component analysis and cluster-based permutation tests of correlation coefficient time series) were identical to that described above.</s></p><p><s>The time window in which we identified significant correlations between M/EEG amplitude and tone frequency was used for subsequent source reconstruction.</s><s>Specifically, individual participants' channel-bytime correlation coefficient time series (for all channel types) were projected into source space using the multiple sparse priors algorithm under group constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Litvak and Friston, 2008)</ref>, as implemented in SPM12; the group constraints ensure that responses are reconstructed in the same subset of sources for the entire participant sample.</s><s>MEG and EEG data were source localized using a single generative model, which assumes that signals from different channel types arise from the same underlying current sources but map onto the sensors through different forward models (MEG, single shell;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have shown that rhythmic temporal expectation improves target chord discrimination accuracy, increases the phase locking of neural signals at chord onset, as well as improves M/EEGbased chord decoding.</s><s>Interestingly, we also show that before chord (i.e., a potential target) onset, temporal expectation improves the decoding of irrelevant distractors (pure tones).</s><s>This beneficial effect can be modeled as increased gain to any stimuli (auditory frequencies) presented at time points adjacent to expected chord onset, and independent of whether processing these frequencies may be beneficial for chord discrimination.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, rhythm-induced temporal expectation increased the participants' sensitivity to target chords.</s><s>Similar behavioral improvements have been reported previously, typically accompanied by shorter RTs to expected targets <ref type="bibr"

between conditions (i.e., only selecting targets preceded by identical intervals), other researchers have also found accuracy improvements in quasirhythmic sequences when acoustic targets were presented following a mean interval versus at other intervals (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jones, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Herrmann et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Another recent study has shown that, while different types of temporal expectation might lead to accuracy benefits, rhythmic expectation specifically shortens RTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Morillon et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>However, RTs have been suggested to be more sensitive to temporal orienting in detection tasks than in discrimination tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Correa et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>While in the present study participants were instructed to discriminate chords by responding as soon as possible after hearing a target, auditory streams continued for several hundreds of milliseconds following target offset, which may have resulted in overall slow responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>) and a reduced sensitivity to detect RT effects.</s></p><p><s>Beyond the increased behavioral sensitivity to target chords, we also observed improved neural decoding of short chords in the rhythmic versus jittered condition.</s><s>Previous auditory studies have shown that rhythmic presentation of targets presented at a low signal-to-noise ratio amid continuous distractors increases their detectability <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lawrance et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rajendran et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Similar findings in visual studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ten Oever et al., 2017)</ref> have been linked to increased phase locking of neural activity around the expected target onset.</s><s>In our study, rhythm-induced temporal expectation increased phase locking of M/EEG signals at the chord presentation rate (but not chord-evoked ERF/ERP amplitude), which is consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cravo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr"

2009</ref>; for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Haegens and Zion Golumbic, 2018)</ref>, which posits that external rhythms synchronize low-frequency neural activity and create time windows of increased sensitivity to stimuli presented at expected latencies.</s><s>However, since phase locking has been shown to also increase due to interval-based expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Breska and Deouell, 2014)</ref>, it may not be a specific measure of rhythminduced temporal expectation.</s></p><p><s>In addition to improving the decoding of short chords (potential targets), rhythmic expectation also improved the decod-ing of pure tones (irrelevant distractors) preceding the chords.</s><s>Current hypotheses are largely agnostic to whether neural alignment to external rhythms also results in temporal trade-offs, creating windows of decreased sensitivity at unexpected or irrelevant latencies.</s><s>Such competitive effects have been described in the domain of spatial visual attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carrasco, 2011)</ref>; however, temporal expectations have been suggested to play a largely modulatory role, amplifying the influence of other (e.g., spatial) sources of top-down control rather than themselves exerting strong influences on neural processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rohenkohl et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>While processing limitations over time have long been established (e.g., in the attentional blink literature; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Shapiro et al., 1994)</ref>, temporal expectations can in fact prevent attentional blink: knowing when subsequent targets will occur can improve their processing and diminish the (detrimental) effects of preceding targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Martens and Johnson, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, cues predicting target latency do seem not only to improve target processing but also to impair processing targets that appear at invalidly cued latencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Denison et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, however, we did not observe impaired processing of stimuli presented at unexpected time points, which would likely manifest as impaired decoding and lower gain in the rhythmic versus jittered condition several hundred milliseconds before and after chord onset.</s><s>Instead, our results suggest that while rhythmic auditory expectation increases sensitivity at expected latencies, it does not necessarily involve temporal trade-off with unexpected latencies.</s></p><p><s>We also considered another possible trade-off, namely temporal expectation boosting the processing of relevant targets at the expense of irrelevant distractors.</s><s>A recent EEG study showed that anticipatory cues not only boost visual target decoding, but also decrease its interference by distractors presented just after the targets, possibly reflecting a protective time window for target processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(van Ede et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>However, as shown in other contexts <ref type="bibr">(Rohenkohl et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Morillon et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Breska and Ivry, 2018)</ref>, rhythm-induced expectations may not operate in the same manner as cue-induced expectations.</s><s>Indeed, rhythms can facilitate performance independently of whether they are predictive of when the relevant targets may appear <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sanabria et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In some cases, performance is superior for those targets that occur on-beat, even if targets more often occur off-beat <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Breska and Deouell, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In line with the latter results, our findings show improved decoding of irrelevant stimuli if they are presented at latencies leading up to the expected onsets of potential targets.</s><s>While these differences were observed between Ïª100 and Ïª80 ms but not at even shorter latencies before chord onset, it is worth noting that decoding pure tones was based on M/EEG activity evoked by these tones (i.e., with a lag of up to 126 ms).</s><s>Thus, just before chord onset, interference between chordevoked activity and tone-evoked activity may have compromised tone decoding.</s><s>Given the previously observed differences between rhythm-and cue-induced temporal expectations, it remains an important open question whether the type of temporal expectation manipulations, and/or individual participants' strategies in generating these expectations, may influence the latencies at which improved decoding can be observed.</s></p><p><s>To interpret the finding that rhythm-based expectation improves the decoding of irrelevant distractors before the expected target onset, we used a model that independently parameterized the gain and tuning of population-level frequency coding and found that rhythm-based expectation increased the gain of pure tone decoding.</s><s>No evidence was found for the sharpening of tuning induced by temporal expectation.</s><s>This suggests that, unlike in previous (animal) studies

classical neuromodulatory effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Auksztulewicz et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Previous behavioral modeling studies showed that rhythm-based expectation does indeed increase the signal-to-noise gain of sensory evidence in a visual discrimination task <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rohenkohl et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Here, the gain effect was independent of whether the specific frequencies were useful for discriminating potential targets, further supporting the notion that the rhythmic increases of sensitivity are independent of stimulus relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Breska and Deouell, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>It is worth noting that, unlike in the previous electrophysiology studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lakatos et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">O'Connell et al., 2014)</ref>, the perceptual discriminations here were based on chords with no overall frequency differences, showing that rhythm-induced expectations can work on composite representations.</s><s>It remains to be tested whether the rhythm-induced dynamic gain modulation generalizes across data modalities and species (e.g., invasive recordings in animal models).</s></p><p><s>On a methodological note, our study is the first to show robust M/EEG-based multivariate decoding of pure tone frequency across a broad range of frequencies.</s><s>While recent studies have brought substantial advances in decoding auditory features, studies using discreet stimuli have focused on decoding complex features such as pitch/rate modulation based on spectral

despite their presentation in gapless streams.</s><s>Finally, topographies of correlations between M/EEG amplitudes and tone frequency could be localized to auditory regions, suggesting that frequency decoding is based on sensory processing of acoustic features rather than on hierarchically higher activity related to complex percepts.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we have demonstrated that rhythmic expectation enhances population responses not only to task-relevant targets, but also to task-irrelevant distractors preceding potential targets.</s><s>The latter effect could be explained in terms of
