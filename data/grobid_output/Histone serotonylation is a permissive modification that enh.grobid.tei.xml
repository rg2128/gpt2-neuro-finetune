to more causally assess the role of Q5ser in these processes, we employed a RN46A-B14 cell culture model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , in which these manipulatable, proliferative 5-HT

that competing against endogenous H3K4me3Q5ser expression alters levels of H3K4me3Q5ser target genes, with little to no impact on non-target loci (Extended Data Fig. <ref

(Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8f</ref>) suggesting that attenuating the mark's expression may cause these cells to remain in a more undifferentiated-like state.</s><s>In line with this idea, Kegg Analysis identified axon guidance as the sole enriched pathway affected by H3.3Q5A expression (Supplementary Data Table <ref type="table">28</ref>).</s><s>We next applied a specific inhibitor of TGM2 (LDN 27219) to RN46A-B14 cells during differentiation, followed by qPCR assessments of candidate genes predicted to be regulated by the mark.</s><s>Of the candidate loci examined, all were found to be downregulated in their expression during differentiation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8g</ref>), consistent with H3K4me3Q5ser's putative role as a permissive modification.</s><s>Finally, predicted associations between the mark's induction and progression of cellular development were validated through assessments of RN46A-B14 neurite outgrowth during differentiation, in which expression of H3.3Q5A was found to significantly reduce neurite length (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8h-i</ref>), consistent with the cells remaining in a less differentiated state.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate potential mechanisms contributing to H3K4me3Q5ser's permissive role in gene expression, we next investigated the impact of Q5ser on nuclear protein binding interactions with the N-terminal H3 tail, both in the presence and absence of K4me3.</s><s>We employed synthetically modified and biotinylated H3 peptides that were used in nuclear extract IPs, followed by LC-MS/MS to identify putative binding proteins.</s><s>Numerous interactions with H3K4me3 vs. H3 unmodified were identified including many well-established H3K4me3 "readers" (Supplementary Data Table <ref type="table">29</ref>).</s><s>Focusing on H3K4me3 binders, we assessed whether the presence of Q5ser in combination with K4me3 might influence these binding events.</s><s>In doing so, we found that 77 (~21%) of these proteins displayed either potentiated or attenuated binding in the presence of Q5ser (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref> and

Taf3-a proxy for the complex-was performed in RN46A-B14 cells pre-and post-differentiation. Taf3/TFIID chromatin associations were elevated in response to differentiation, with the bulk of its increased enrichment observed around transcriptional start sites (TSSs) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9c</ref> and Supplementary Data Tables <ref type="table">31</ref><ref type="table">32</ref>), as exemplified by the Prrg4 locus (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9d</ref>).</s><s>Further assessments of Taf3/TFIID peak overlap post-differentiation with differential H3K4me3 or H3K4me3Q5ser (vs.</s><s>those genes containing differential sites for both or neither of the marks) revealed that ~48% of all Taf3/TFIID bound genes following transition to a post-mitotic state correlate with altered H3K4me3Q5ser enrichment (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9e</ref>).</s><s>While alterations in both marks were found to correlate with Taf3/ TFIID genes, only ~28% of differentially enriched genes for H3K4me3 were found to overlap with Taf3/TFIID post-differentiation.</s><s>In comparison to H3K4me3, greater overlaps were also observed between protein-coding genes displaying altered enrichment for both H3K4me3Q5ser and Taf3/TFIID post-differentiation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9f</ref> and Supplementary Data Table <ref type="table">33</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Serotonylation of H3Q5 represents the first endogenous monoaminyl modification of histones to be described (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9g</ref>), as well as the first non-methyl PTM of glutamine residues (e.g., H2AQ105me <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> ) identified in histone proteins.</s><s>Much remains to be delineated with respect to histone serotonylation's potential functions in vivo.</s><s>For example what is the mark's stoichiometry relative to H3K4me3, are there specific non-H3K4me3 "readers" or demonoaminylases that control its activities, is the mark responsive to environmental perturbations or pathophysiological states associated with alterations in 5-HT production and/or signaling, etc.? Q5ser does appear, however, to be a modification that acts to alter specific protein interactions with H3K4me3 and is likely involved in reinforcing permissive patterns of gene expression within selected tissues and/or cell-types.</s><s>The precise mechanisms through which the mark is targeted to genomic loci, however, remain unknown.</s><s>Furthermore, while H3K4me3Q5ser associations with TFIID may facilitate locus specific gene expression during differentiation, such interactions likely only explain a fragment of the mark's role in genic regulation.</s><s>Finally, it stands to reason that alternative histone monoaminylation states may exist in vivo and might act distinctly or cooperatively with H3 serotonylation to regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells.</s><s>Thus, these findings may reveal a vast array of mechanisms for future explorations related to this new class of histone PTMs.</s></p></div>

however, the degree to which they differ cannot be accurately defined.</s></p><p><s>When the marks are IP'd, endogenous Q5ser and K4me3Q5ser peptides are detected passing all criteria discussed above.</s><s>However, information about other H3 (3-8) peptides is lost throughout this process and relative stoichiometries cannot be inferred.</s><s>Until technology exists that allows for enrichment of all modified forms of this peptide with equal affinity in a single step, stoichiometry cannot be measured.</s><s>Finally, while the serotonyl marks are not of high abundance in vivo (at least in comparison to some other forms of this peptide-e.g., unmodified H3 3-8), we remain confident in its functional significance as a combinatorial potentiator of binding interactions with H3K4me3, itself a low abundance modification of great importance.</s></p></div>
