~6,500 genes), which agreed well with prior analysis of permanganate reactivity on ~60 genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since Pol II stalls within the same promoter-proximal interval globally, we wondered whether the initially transcribed sequence might contribute to stalling.</s><s>Given that the stability of the 9-bp RNA-DNA hybrid in the elongation complex greatly influences the efficiency of elongation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20)</ref>, we calculated the melting temperature (Tm) of each 9-bp sequence across the initially transcribed region for genes shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and for control genes that did not generate significant short RNAs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>There were clear differences between these profiles: whereas the profile of the control group was essentially flat, genes that produced short RNAs exhibited a peak of Tm between positions +20 and +35 that corresponded to the primary sites of Pol II stalling.</s><s>This peak was followed by a decline in Tm which would serve to progressively destabilize the elongation complex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20)</ref>.</s><s>These observations support a two-step model of stalling wherein the elongating polymerase first pauses transiently within the downstream region of weak RNA-DNA hybrid stability, and then slides backwards along DNA to a site with high thermodynamic stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>.</s><s>To verify that the position of stalling coincides with the peak in hybrid stability, we repeated Tm analysis on a subset of genes that displayed one predominant 3'end position, and found that it aligned with the region of highest Tm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>; fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Although there were clear differences in the Tm profiles between genes that produced short RNAs and those that did not, some genes that lacked short RNAs in S2 cells nonetheless displayed an elevated Tm within the region from +20 and +35 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>To test whether these genes might be stalled in another cell type, we isolated short RNAs from 0-16h Drosophila embryos and found &gt;1,500 genes that did not generate short RNAs in S2 cells but did so during embryo development.</s><s>The Tm within the promoter-proximal region (+20 to +35) of these new genes was significantly higher than for genes without short RNAs (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>; P&lt;0.0001), and calculation of a Tm profile around the embryo-derived 3'-ends confirmed that they mapped within a peak in melting temperature.</s><s>These results indicated that sequence composition of the initially transcribed region predisposes the polymerase to stall, and could be used to predict genes that are most likely to possess stalled Pol II under different conditions.</s></p><p><s>Our data suggested that stalled elongation complexes have undergone backtracking following transient pausing.</s><s>The transcript cleavage factor TFIIS (IIS) has been shown to reactivate Pol II in backtracked and arrested elongation complexes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), including stalled Pol II at the Drosophila hsp70 gene (24) (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>).</s><s>If backtracking is a general feature of early polymerase elongation, then we should be able to detect evidence for IISmediated cleavage and shortening of promoter-proximal RNAs by comparing RNA profiles in mock-treated and IIS-depleted cells.</s><s>Indeed, RNAi-depletion of IIS caused a global increase in RNA lengths (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>; P &lt;10 -15 ).</s><s>Moreover, RNAs between 35-60 nt long were specifically enriched in IIS-depleted cells, indicating that they are the primary targets of IISinduced cleavage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>A concomitant reduction in 20-35 nt RNAs in IIS-deficient cells suggested that these RNAs are produced in part by IIS.</s><s>Genes with stalled Pol II were significantly more likely to exhibit RNA lengthening upon IIS-depletion than genes lacking stalled polymerase (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S12</ref>; P&lt;10 -4 ), indicating that polymerase stalling generally involves backtracking.</s><s>Comparison of short RNA and permanganate reactivity profiles on individual genes showed that, unlike the RNA 3'-ends, which were clearly shifted downstream in IISdepleted cells, the location of the transcription bubble did not change (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>These results indicated that the primary location of the stalled elongation complex at steady-state reflected the position to which the polymerase has backtracked.</s></p><p><s>Recent work has underscored the importance of early transcription elongation and its regulation in vivo <ref type="bibr">(1-3, 25, 26)</ref>.</s><s>Our data reveal that fluctuations in RNA-DNA hybrid stability in the initially transcribed sequence make the polymerase susceptible to pausing and backtracking.</s><s>This tendency is likely amplified by the presence of downstream nucleosomes and the reported absence of secondary structures within these short RNAs that would inhibit backtracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, elongation factors specifically target promoter-proximal Pol II to regulate the duration of stalling.</s><s>For example, the negative transcription elongation factor NELF has been shown biochemically to both enhance the duration of intrinsic pauses and to inhibit IIS activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our data indicate that stalled polymerase complexes do not efficiently escape into productive elongation even after rescue by IIS-induced cleavage.</s><s>In fact, many rounds of pausing, backtracking and cleavage, or perhaps even termination, may ensue before a positive signal such as the activity of the PTEF-b kinase releases the stalled Pol II from the promoter-proximal region <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, our data suggest that transient stalling of polymerase is a general feature of early elongation, even at highly active genes, since we observe short RNAs with similar distributions arising from nearly all active genes (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref>).</s><s>Thus, understanding how the duration of stalling is regulated under various conditions is of considerable interest, and our RNA-based approach opens a possibility for detailed dissection of this process on a genome-wide scale.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Short capped RNAs are produced by promoter-proximal Pol II Distribution of RNA 5'-ends (blue) and Pol II ChIP-seq signal (red) on (A) myoglianin (CG1838) a gene with stalled Pol II and low expression and (B) CG10289, a gene with more uniform polymerase distribution and high expression.</s><s>The peak number of RNA reads (1-nt windows) and Pol II ChIP-seq reads (25-bp windows) is indicated in the corresponding color.</s><s>Insets contain magnified views of the TSSs.</s><s>(C) The number of short RNAs that mapped to stalled genes (median reads/TSS=1,477) as compared to genes that were not considered stalled (median reads/TSS=178).</s><s>Box plots represent the 25 th , 50 th and 75 th</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="6,195.72,61.00,280.56,504.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
