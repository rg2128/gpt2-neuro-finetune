<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Coordinated dorsal migration of primary sympathetic ganglia.</s><s>Time-lapse confocal microscopy of fluorescently labelled primary sympathetic ganglia cells revealed a series of well-ordered steps that appear to be choreographed to position the secondary sympathetic ganglia adjacent to the ventral root.</s><s>In the first step, a small number of cells on the dorsal side of the primary sympathetic ganglia extend multiple processes restricted in orientation towards the ventral root (93% in the direction of the ventral root, calculated ±45°from the perpendicular to the ventral root; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-i</ref>; asterisk in b,c; Supplementary Movie 1).</s><s>In contrast, cells within the ganglion that are positioned closer to the dorsal aorta continue to extend processes in all directions (56% initially in the direction of the ventral root as measured above; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref> 0 (inset); d,e, asterisk; Supplementary Movie 1); although they subsequently reorient the majority of their processes in the direction of the ventral root (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>, asterisk; Supplementary Movie 1) and move into the body of the loosely connected cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>,i; Supplementary Movie 1).</s><s>We identify this step as symmetry breaking of the primary sympathetic ganglia.</s></p><p><s>In the subsequent step, primary sympathetic ganglia elongate and move as a coordinated group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1j-r</ref>, Supplementary Movie 2).</s><s>Individual cells within the loosely connected cluster maintain extensive contacts with both local and non-local (more than one cell diameter) neighbours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1k</ref>,l; Supplementary Movie 2).</s><s>Cells that move away from the cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1m</ref> 0 (inset), m-q, Supplementary Movie 2) may extend long processes to sample the local microenvironment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1m</ref>,n, asterisk; q, Supplementary Movie 2), but markedly collapse, reorient processes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1o</ref>, asterisk; q, Supplementary Movie 2), and move to re-join the loosely connected cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1p</ref>, asterisk; q, Supplementary Movie 2).</s><s>In addition, a fiduciary mark placed in the tissue (Supplementary Movie 2; upper left purple marking) confirms sympathetic ganglia cell clusters migrate past this stationary point in the tissue, indicating active migration and not solely tissue growth results in positioning the permanent sympathetic ganglia.</s><s>We identify this step as 'directed migration of the primary sympathetic ganglia'.</s></p><p><s>The last step completes the positioning of the primary sympathetic ganglia cluster, thus conferring 'secondary' status to the 'primary' sympathetic ganglia.</s><s>As the primary sympathetic cluster approaches the ventral root, cells change shape and position to reform a tightly packed, cohesive ganglion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1s</ref>,z 0 , 18% decrease in size; Supplementary Movie 3).</s><s>Individual cells near the perimeter of the cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1t</ref>,v 0 (inset), v; asterisk, Supplementary Movie 3) reorient their processes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1w-y</ref>, asterisk; z, Supplementary Movie 3) and move to integrate into the cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1y</ref>, asterisk; z, Supplementary Movie 3).</s><s>This is the 're-aggregation of the primary sympathetic ganglia at target'.</s><s>Thus, the migration event of the primary sympathetic ganglia to the secondary, final location is a well-coordinated, multi-step process that includes symmetry breaking, directed migration of a loosely connected and coordinated cell group and re-aggregation into a tight cell cluster.</s></p><p><s>Post-and preganglionic neurons extensively interact.</s><s>Given the selective orientation of processes extending from the primary sympathetic ganglia towards the developing spinal nerve immediately before dorsal migration, we sought to investigate the dynamic interactions between the dorsal migrating postganglionic cells with the spinal nerve.</s><s>The first signs of cellular interaction between the pre-and post-ganglionic neurons occur on the dorsal, or spinal nerve facing, side of the primary sympathetic ganglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-k</ref>, Supplementary Movie 4).</s><s>Cells within the primary sympathetic ganglia extend long protrusions that stretch over 100 mm and persist in the direction of the spinal nerve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>-f, d 0 ; asterisk; Supplementary Movie 4).</s><s>Long protrusions extend from all cells within the primary sympathetic ganglia, but preferentially from neural cells within the middle of the cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2l</ref>-n, Supplementary Movie 4).</s><s>In comparison, preganglionic sympathetic axons that course through the ventral root make a stunning 90°turn towards the primary sympathetic ganglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>; splanchnic nerve, Supplementary Movie 5), before physical contact with primary sympathetic ganglia cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>,g,h,h 0 ; asterisk, Supplementary Movie 5).</s><s>Growth cone tips of the preganglionic sympathetic neurons continue to extend and glide along the primary sympathetic ganglia neuronal protrusions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2i</ref>, Supplementary Movie 5), eventually stopping when they reach the primary sympathetic ganglia cell bodies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>; asterisk, Supplementary Movie 5).</s><s>Although the primary sympathetic ganglia structure is loosely cohesive, the cells within are still moving dynamically while in contact with preganglionic axonal projections.</s><s>In time-lapse Supplementary Movies, preganglionic axonal projections intertwine between migrating primary sympathetic ganglia neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2k</ref>, Supplementary Movie 5) to eventually circumscribe the multicellular cluster and move with it to the final, permanent location adjacent to their branch point off the ventral root (Supplementary Movie 5).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dorsal migration requires contact with preganglionic axons.</head><p><s>Given the tight and persistent contact between the dorsally migrating primary sympathetic ganglia and preganglionic axons, we sought to determine whether this contact was required for dorsal migration.</s><s>To this end, we manipulated the ventral root and tracked the cell dynamics of the primary sympathetic ganglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-i</ref>).</s><s>Transection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref>, Supplementary Movie 6) or removal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d-f</ref>, Supplementary Movie 7) of the ventral root from the base of the ventral neural tube after the primary sympathetic ganglia initiated dorsal migration Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) St. 25;

Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>), and TrkB, expressed by cells within the primary sympathetic ganglia at HH St. 24, before the initiation of dorsal migration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3l</ref>,m; TrkB is expressed 2.3 times higher in sympathetic ganglia versus ventral neural tube using qPCR, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>This was further confirmed by protein localization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j-m</ref>).</s><s>TrkB protein was shown to be strongly expressed by HH St. 24 sympathetic ganglia but absent in the ventral root (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3k-m</ref>).</s><s>BDNF was strongly expressed in the ventral neural tube at HH St. 24 (immediately before the onset of dorsal migration, location of preganglionic neurons;
