illustrated in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, where the dynamics of an unstructured and a balanced clustered network with 20 groups are shown side by side (see Materials and Methods for a description of the networks).</s><s>Hereafter, we will refer to such activity as slow-switching assembly (SSA) dynamics.</s><s>Visually, SSA dynamics manifests itself as bands of increased activity in the raster plots, and can be statistically quantified from the resulting spike-train dynamics a posteriori (see Eq <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> in Materials and

networks are notoriously difficult to analyze due to their inherent non-linearity; hence an exact analytical treatment of the dynamical evolution for an arbitrary clustered topology is essentially intractable.</s><s>However, two concepts from spectral graph theory and linear systems provide valuable insights: (i) for symmetric, non-negative connectivity matrices, it can be shown that a modular network structure implies a gap in the spectrum of the graph (i.e., in the set of eigenvalues of the weight matrix) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, as well as the block-localization of the associated eigenvectors on the modules of the network (noting that isolated eigenvalues may also be the result of other features <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>); (ii) for linear systems, a gap in the spectrum of the graph results in a separation of time scales in the dynamical process <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>This relation between the modular structure, the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors, and linear network

graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, although the presence of groups of neurons with different cardinalities and variances means that the eigenvalue distribution is not completely uniform on the circle <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Note also that the balanced construction of the LIF network, with a marginally larger inhibitory input for each neuron in order to keep the network stable, leads to the existence of one pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues which lies separate from the main bulk of the spectrum (black

<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>).</s><s>As shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, this unclustered network exhibits the expected asynchronous, unstructured neuronal spiking dynamics.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, the LIF network with clustered excitatory neurons displays banded SSA dynamics.</s><s>Spectrally, its weight matrix exhibits a clear gap Δλ along the real axis of its spectrum (Fig 1B <ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">right</ref>) and, as shown in a later section, the associated Schur vectors also exhibit a measure of structural block-localization.</s><s>We remark that, in general, this should not be expected a priori, since the weight matrices are asymmetric and include both positive (excitatory) and negative (inhibitory) couplings.</s></p><p><s>To ascertain the dynamical relevance of the spectral gap, we examined the relation between the clustering strength in the network, defined as the ratio of probabilities of connections inside and outside the neural assemblies (R EE ¼ p EE in =p EE out ), the spectral gap (Δλ), and the magnitude of the numerically observed SSA dynamics.</s><s>To quantify the assembly spike-rate variability, we have defined two complementary metrics.</s><s>First, the metric Ŝ measures the heterogeneity in the firing rates of the putative cell-assemblies averaged over the simulation (see Eq <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> in Materials and Methods).</s><s>A large value of Ŝ indicates that the average firing rates of the assemblies are diverse, whereas a low Ŝ indicates that all groups have very similar firing rates at all times and no group shows elevated firing.</s><s>Under SSA dynamics, the variability of firing rates across groups increases in time as the assemblies transition between high and low firing rates.</s><s>As discussed below, it is possible that the heightened firing activity is localized in a particular assembly and does not switch between assemblies.</s><s>This non-switching dynamics where only a group of neurons exhibits elevated firing over the entire simulation time can be detected using the second variability measure ŜT , defined in Eq <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>For SSA dynamics, both Ŝ and ŜT give similar results (see S1 Fig) .</s><s>In the rest of the paper, we focus on SSA dynamics and mainly use Ŝ, except when discussing the transition to non-switching behavior.</s><s>Definitions of these quantities are given in Materials and Methods.</s></p><p><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows that SSA becomes observable above a threshold of the clustering strength R EE , although the dependence of this threshold on the size of the network and number of clusters does not seem to follow an obvious pattern.</s><s>On the other hand, our numerics show that the spectral gap provides a more direct indicator of the presence of SSA dynamics in the network.</s><s>The relationship between R EE and Δλ (Fig 2C ) shows that knowing R EE is not sufficient to determine Δλ as the spectral gap depends on other factors such as the network size and the number of groups in the network.</s></p><p><s>Together with the examination of the structure of the associated orthogonal subspace (see Section "The block-localization of the dominant linear subspace"), such spectral characterization may be used to establish the potential of networks to sustain SSA activity, even if there is no obviously clustered network model known a priori.</s></p><p><s>The observed spectral properties of clustered LIF networks lead us to consider a stylized linear rate model for neuronal activity in the next section, as a means to gain insights into the defining factors of the wiring

localized firing in different groups across the network.</s><s>We found that the presence of the slow switching time scale is reflected in the spectral properties of the synaptic weight matrix: a gap separating the leading eigenvalues together with a block-localization of the associated Schur vectors on groups of neurons is a key indicator of the presence of SSA dynamics in the network.</s><s>In line with this observation, multiple gaps in the eigenvalue spectrum are indicative of further time scales in the network dynamics (see <ref type="bibr">Fig 10)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, when the leading

small-world scheme introduced by Watts and Strogatz <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Networks with scale-free connectivity.</s><s>LIF networks with a scale-free topology for the excitatory connections were created by a preferential attachment process <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> using algorithm 5 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> with parameter d =
