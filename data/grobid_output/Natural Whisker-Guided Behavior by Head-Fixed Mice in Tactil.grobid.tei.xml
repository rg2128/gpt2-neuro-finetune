(Bio-Serv; K3327 and K3251) in a reverse light cycle room (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Data from the following strains were pooled: C57BL/6Crl (The Jackson Laboratory; 000664, RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664 ), scnn1a-tg3-cre (The Jackson Laboratory; 009613, RRID:IMSR_JAX:009613) X AI32 (The Jackson Laboratory; 012569), VGAT-ChR2-EYFP (The Jackson Laboratory; 014548, RRID:IMSR_JAX: 014548; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Mice received 1.5 ml of water per day, which corresponds to ϳ50% of ad libitum water consumption for C57BL/6J mice (Mouse Phenome Database from The Jackson Laboratory; http://www.</s><s>jax.org/phenome).</s><s>Mice obtained water either during behavioral sessions or by supplemental water given after the session.</s><s>Weight gain during the behavioral session was taken as a lower bound on the amount of water consumed, and the water supplemented was determined accordingly.</s><s>The weight and health (posture, condition of fur, and motor activity) of the mice were monitored daily.</s><s>All procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the Janelia Farm Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</s></p><p><s>Surgical procedures.</s><s>Mice were head-fixed using a titanium head postimplant (22.5 mm length; 3.2 mm width; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Guo et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>For implantation, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, (1-2% by volume in O 2 ; SurgiVet, Smiths Medical), and maintained at 37°C body temperature on a thermal blanket (Harvard Apparatus).</s><s>Following a local injection of Marcaine (50 l), the scalp and periosteum over the dorsal surface of the skull were removed.</s><s>The skull was then coated with a thin layer of cyanoacrylate adhesive (Krazy Glue, Elmer's Products).</s><s>The head post was placed on the skull with its anterior edge aligned to the lambdoid suture and fixed in place using clear dental acrylic (Jet Repair Acrylic, Lang Dental Manufacturing; P/N 1223-clear).</s><s>The remaining exposed cyano-acrylate adhesive was covered with a thin layer of dental acrylic.</s><s>Buprenorphine HCl (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection; Bedford Laboratories) was used for postoperative analgesia.</s><s>Ketoprofen (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection; Fort Dodge Animal Health) was used at the time of surgery and postoperatively for two additional days to reduce inflammation.</s><s>Mice were allowed at least 3 d to recover from surgery before being placed on water restriction.</s></p><p><s>Whisker trimming.</s><s>For some experiments (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>) whiskers were trimmed progressively: full whisker field; a row of whiskers (C1-C3); a single whisker (C2); no whiskers.</s><s>Whisker trimming was performed under isofluorane anesthesia and mice were given overnight to recover.</s><s>At least two behavioral sessions were performed with each whisker configuration.</s></p><p><s>Data acquisition and control.</s><s>Behavioral control was implemented using a real-time system (BControl; http://brodylab.princeton.edu/bcontrol)</s><s>based on real-time Linux (code.google.com/p/rt-fsm).</s><s>A MATLAB (Math-Works) program running on Windows XP communicated over Ethernet with the real-time system which also interfaced with PCI-6229 and PCI-6713 data acquisition boards (National Instruments) using COMEDI drivers <ref type="bibr">(comedi.org;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">O'Connor et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The real-time system executed a module of C code at 6 kHz that read and wrote digital and analog voltages on the data acquisition boards for monitoring and controlling the apparatus.</s><s>The system received commands from MATLAB and sent data back to MATLAB for logging at 4 Hz.</s></p><p><s>Spherical treadmill.</s><s>The spherical treadmill was a 15.56 inch diameter hollow Smoothfoam ball (Plasteel; 16 inch diameter, Ball no.</s><s>183).</s><s>Balls were purchased as hollow halves with an initial wall thickness of 19.5 Ϯ 0.2 mm and weight of 121.3 Ϯ 0.5 g.</s><s>The inside of the halves was carved with a hot wire system (Hot Wire Foam Factory) to give a wall thickness of 3.79 Ϯ 0.66 mm.</s><s>Two matched halves were glued together with expanded polystyrene foam glue (Hot Wire Foam Factory; Foam Glue, no.</s><s>028B-8).</s><s>The total weight of the ball was 82.5 g.</s><s>The ball was supported by 10 Ping-Pong balls (JOOLA Gold 3-Star 40 mm) in air cannons.</s><s>Each air cannon consisted of a 1.577 inch diameter acrylic tube plugged at one end with an acetyl resin base plate containing a tube fitting (McMaster Carr, no.</s><s>50745K15) for air flow.</s><s>The air cannons were clamped at regular intervals around the ball in a custom 19 inch diameter acrylic ribbed bowl.</s><s>One cannon was located under the bottom of the ball, three cannons were located in a ring at a latitude of 60°S, and six were located in a ring at a latitude of 20°S.</s><s>The airflow to the bottom cannon, the ring of cannons at 60°S, and two groups of three cannons at 20°S was controlled independently with regulators <ref type="bibr">(McMaster Carr,</ref><ref type="bibr">nos. 3846K29 and 5627K511)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Ball tracking.</s><s>Rotation of the ball was tracked using two cameras containing chips that measure optic flow (Avago Technologies, ADNS-6090) with a serial interface to a microcontroller (Atmel, ATMega644p; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Seelig et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The cameras were mounted on the ribbed bowl around the equator of the ball, 45 mm from the ball surface.</s><s>One camera was directly in front of the mouse, and one was on the right.</s><s>The surface of the ball in front of each camera was illuminated using a 940 nm IR LED (Roithner, ELJ-940-629).</s><s>Each camera imaged a 2.2 ϫ 2.2 mm 2 field of view onto a 30 ϫ 30 pixel sensor with a lens (focal length 25 mm; Computar) and a 10 mm extension tube.</s><s>The microcontroller interfaced with a PC running MATLAB via serial communication and provided shutter time (inverse of light level) and contrast metrics.</s><s>These parameters were used to focus the lenses and adjust the illumination during initial setup.</s><s>For tracking ball motion, every 2 ms the microcontroller received two signed integers measuring the optic flow ⌬ x and ⌬ y from each camera.</s><s>These signals were converted to analog voltages ranging from 0 to 5 V, centered on 2.5 V, with 150 mV resolution.</s><s>The microcontroller also provided a clock signal.</s><s>The RTLinux was triggered by the clock signal to read and rediscretize the analog values of the optic flow.</s><s>The vector of camera motion displacement signals was transformed to a vector of ball motion v ball by multiplication with a calibration matrix A calib ,</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v ball ϭ A calib ϫ [⌬ x1 , ⌬ y1 , ⌬ x2 , ⌬ y2 ]Ј.</formula><p><s>Ball rotation calibration.</s><s>To determine A calib , the rotation of the ball was recorded independently of the ball tracking system using a highspeed (500 Hz) camera (Mikrotron MC1362).</s><s>The field-of-view was 11 ϫ 11 mm 2 (27 pixels per mm).</s><s>The camera was focused on the surface of the top of the ball, where the head of the mouse would be.</s><s>Each video image was corrected for uneven illumination.</s><s>For each frame, the forward and sideways rotation of the ball was computed from the x and y displacements that gave the peak cross-correlation with the next frame.</s><s>A calib was determined by least squares fitting a linear transformation from the camera-motion displacement signals to the recorded forward and sideways rotation of the ball.</s><s>The predicted ball motion and actual ball motion had a correlation coefficient of 0.97.</s><s>Thus, the real-time tracking system provided a high bandwidth and accurate measurement of ball motion.</s></p><p><s>Moveable walls for tactile virtual reality.</s><s>Two walls were mounted on either side of the mouse.</s><s>For most experiments, each wall (height, 0.75 inches; length, 2 inches) was a 0.04-inch-thick aluminum sheet; in some cases, the walls were standard glass microscope slides <ref type="bibr">(Fischerbrand,</ref>.</s><s>The use of glass walls allowed unobstructed video of the mouse from the side.</s><s>The lower edges of the walls were 1 mm above the surface of the ball and parallel to the anterior-posterior axis of the mouse.</s><s>The back edges of the walls were positioned in line with the posterior end of the whisker pad.</s><s>This prevented the front paws of the mouse from touching the walls.</s><s>The head of the mouse was positioned such that the distance from the surface of the ball to the center of the eyes was ϳ19 mm and to the tip of the nose was ϳ15 mm.</s><s>Each wall was attached to an x-y translation stage moved by linear servomotors (MX80 L, Parker Hannifin).</s><s>The linear servos were tuned without integral control to maximize response speed.</s><s>Each axis had 50 mm of travel and could be controlled either from software or via an analog voltage provided directly to the controller (ACR9000, Parker Hannifin).</s><s>The analog input was used to update the position of the walls at 500 Hz.</s><s>Each axis was controlled over 40 mm of travel.</s><s>The repeatability of the wall position was Ϯ13 m (SD), as determined by tracking wall position with the same high-speed video system that was used for calibrating the ball rotation, (37 m pixel size).</s><s>The analog input was low-pass filtered with a second order lowpass Butterworth filter (cutoff frequency, 100 Hz).</s><s>To characterize the control of the servomotors, sinusoidal command signals (frequencies 0.5-7.5 Hz, amplitude 5 mm) were sent to the wall while tracking wall position with high-speed video.</s><s>The average lag of the wall position was 13 ms across frequencies.</s><s>The ratio of the measured motion amplitude to the command amplitude ranged from 1.00 to 1.12 across frequencies.</s><s>Before the start of each experiment, the software control was used to home and position the walls in the desired place.</s><s>The walls were not allowed to come closer than 4 mm to the face, ensuring that mice touched the walls only using their whiskers.</s></p><p><s>Delivery of water rewards.</s><s>Water was delivered through a 0.05 inch outer diameter stainless steel tube (Small Parts, HTX-18H-36-10).</s><s>Water flow was controlled using a solenoid valve (Lee Company, LHDA0533115H) such that each droplet was ϳ6.6 l.</s><s>The tube was attached to a 3D printed thermoplastic piece that could be positioned using a three-axis stepper motor system controlled via a joystick (Zaber 3X, NA11B30 and T-JOY3).</s><s>Licks were detected using an electrical lick detector that uses a small current to trigger a voltage change when a lick completes a circuit and triggers a change in the output voltage of the detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Slotnick, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Lick rate was calculated by convolving the individually detected licks with a 1 s window.</s></p><p><s>Infrared illumination system.</s><s>The tactile virtual reality system was contained in a lighttight box built from 25 mm construction rails (Thorlabs, XE25 series) and aluminum sheets held in place with magnetic tape <ref type="bibr">(McMaster Carr,</ref><ref type="bibr">5759K36)</ref>.</s><s>For videography, the area around the mouse was illuminated with four 940 nm IR LEDs (Roithner, TO package 940-66-60) powered by LED drivers (BuckPuck 3023-D-E-1000) and focused with 40 mm focal length aspheric condenser lenses (Thorlabs, ACL5040-B).</s><s>A fiber optic illuminator (Edmund Optics, Dolan-Jenner Model 180) controlled by a foot pedal (Treadlite II T-91-SC3) provided visible light for placing the animal into the head-fixation apparatus.</s><s>For trials with visual illumination two 470 nm 700 mA LEDs (Luxeon Star) were used (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Video tracking of movements.</s><s>Video of whisker movements was acquired at 500 Hz, 640 ϫ 480 pixels, using a high-speed camera (Mikrotron, MC1362) with a 0.36ϫ telecentric lens <ref type="bibr">(Edmund Optics,</ref>, and frame grabber (Bitflow) controlled by StreamPix5 multicamera software (Norpix).</s><s>Each frame was triggered by a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) pulse from the real-time system.</s><s>A mirror directed light from the whiskers to the camera (Ted Pella; 26002-G).</s><s>For some sessions, a piece of laminated white paper was placed immediately on top of the surface of the ball and under the whiskers to provide a uniform background for whisker video.</s></p><p><s>Video of other mouse movements was acquired at 100 Hz from two cameras (Basler, acA640) in StreamPix5.</s><s>Each frame was triggered by a TTL pulse from the real-time system.</s><s>Either every trial, or every 12 s, whichever was shorter, a trigger was sent by the RTLinux to instruct StreamPix5 to create a new video file.</s></p><p><s>Locomotion.</s><s>High-resolution forward and lateral components of velocity were calculated from the ball motion displacements by filtering with a low-pass filter (four pole Butterworth, 30 Hz).</s><s>Running speed was the magnitude of the velocity.</s><s>A running speed threshold was defined as the minimum of the speed distribution between 0 cm/s and the peak running speed of each mouse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>The lateral acceleration was the derivative of the lateral velocity component.</s><s>The run angle was the angle of the velocity smoothed with a moving average (500 ms window).</s><s>The smoothing was applied to average angle fluctuations produced by individual strides.</s><s>Positive values of run angle correspond to running left.</s><s>Power spectra of the lateral acceleration were calculated for each trial with Welch's method (1 s Hamming window, 90% overlap, 1024 fft points) and averaged together across 4 s trials where the mean running speed was above the running speed threshold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>To generate a probability density function of stride frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>), the peak frequency (Ͻ6 Hz) of the power spectrum was calculated on a trial-by-trial basis.</s><s>The stride signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) was the bandpass filtered lateral acceleration (four pole Butterworth, 2-6 Hz).</s><s>Stride amplitude and phase were calculated as the magnitude and angle of the Hilbert transform of the stride signal.</s><s>Stride frequency is the derivative of the unwrapped stride phase computed with the Savitzky Golay method (fourth order, 400 ms window).</s><s>The slope of stride frequency against running speed was calculated by linear regression after discarding speeds Ͻ0.1 cm/s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>

whiskers either unilaterally or bilaterally.</s><s>Whisker angle was measured as the angle between the whisker and a line perpendicular to the midline of the mouse.</s><s>Thus, 0°corresponds to a whisker perpendicular to the mouse, positive values correspond to protracted whiskers, and negative values correspond to retracted angles.</s><s>Trials with whisker tracking errors in Ͼ10% of images (27% of trials) were rejected.</s><s>For the remaining trials, whisker angle was interpolated over the mistracked frames.</s><s>Whisker set point was calculated as the moving average of whisker angle (500 ms window).</s><s>Whisking amplitude and phase were calculated as the magnitude and angle of the Hilbert transform of the bandpass filtered whisker angle (four pole Butterworth, 8 -30 Hz; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hill et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Whisking frequency was the derivative of the unwrapped whisker phase taken with the Savitzky Golay method (fourth order, 400 ms

probability density function of whisking frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref> ), the peak frequency (Ͼ10 Hz) of the power spectrum was calculated on a trial-by-trial basis <ref

walls.</s><s>A lowfrequency component of the whisking signal was isolated with a bandpass filter (four pole Butterworth, 2-8 Hz).</s><s>Amplitude, phase, and frequency of this component of whisking
