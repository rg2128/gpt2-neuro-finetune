<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Clustered distribution of b3-containing GABA A Rs in GCs.</s><s>We first examined the expression pattern of the b3-subunit in horizontal sections of the OB using a b3-selective antibody.</s><s>Consistent with previous results 7, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , immunolabelling was found in all layers of the OB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), but most prominently in the external plexiform layer (EPL, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Viral labelling of GCs with membrane-bound green fluorescent protein (mGFP) reveals b3-subunit immunolabelling throughout the spatial domain occupied by the GCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>To visualize the expression and distribution of the b3-subunit within GCs, single GCs were labelled by sparsely expressing mGFP in the GCL (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>To achieve this, rAAV-DIO-mGFP together with 1:1,000 diluted rAAV-Cre particles were stereotaxically delivered to the GCL of wild-type mice.</s><s>After 3 weeks of expression, the OB tissue was stained with antibodies directed against the b3-subunit.</s><s>Using the three-dimensonal (3D)-immunohistochemistry approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , a strategy to selectively visualize proteins expressed within a structure of interest (illustrated in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C-F</ref>), we found a clustered distribution of the b3-subunit in GCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c-h</ref>).</s><s>These clusters show a preferred localization at the soma and dendritic shaft (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), with only low abundance in the distal dendritic tree of GCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>Magnified 3D reconstructions of the regions indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> further illustrate this distribution pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d-g</ref>).</s><s>The two apical regions shown in panels d and e reveal dense b3-immunoreactive clusters;

n ¼ 14 control cells and n ¼ 12 knockout cells; t-test; Po0.001).</s><s>Control cells exhibited a low mIPSC frequency and, on deletion of the b3-subunit, mIPSCs occurred only rarely (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5f</ref>; n ¼ 14 control cells and n ¼ 12 knockout cells; t-test; P ¼ 0.001).</s><s>Furthermore, local application of 100-mM muscimol using a 50-ms puff (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>, lower panels) revealed a strong reduction in the GABA A R current in knockout cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5g</ref>; n ¼ 8 control cells and n ¼ 14 knockout cells; t-test; Po0.0001).</s><s>This is consistent with the observed strong reduction in the number of b3-positive clusters (see above) and previously published results obtained in global b3-subunit knockout mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The remaining clusters had much smaller intensities and therefore contained a strongly reduced number of b3-subunits.</s><s>The latter will cause a decrease in the mIPSC amplitudes towards the noise level of the recordings, giving rise to an apparent reduction in mIPSC frequency.</s><s>Variability in receptor turnover, viral infection rate and incubation time after viral injection may explain that GABA A R-mediated currents were abolished in only 50% of the cells, while the remaining cells showed small currents.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, these results provide evidence for a strong decrease in functional GABA A -Rs at inhibitory input synapses of GCs in GABRB3 DGCL mice.</s></p></div>

periods no longer than 12 h).</s><s>The weight of the animals was strictly monitored and kept 485% of the initial body weight.</s><s>The pre-training took 3-5 days and the behavioural training took 4-8 weeks.</s><s>All animals tested were able to successfully learn the behaviour paradigm.</s><s>Eight-channel semi-automated olfactometers <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> (Knosys,
