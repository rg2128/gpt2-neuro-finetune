<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>A fundamental challenge in biology is to understand how repetitive morphologic structures develop and evolve.</s><s>Periodic color patterns are a fascinating system with which to explore these questions because of their diversity, sophistication, and visual accessibility, and because the cellular, developmental, and molecular mechanisms that underlie spots and stripes in warm-blooded animals are largely unknown.</s></p><p><s>Traditional model organisms such as laboratory mice have been instrumental for identifying genes that regulate pigment cell production, melanin synthesis, and the pathways that alter the balance between two types of pigment, pheomelanin and eumelanin <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> , but it is unknown to what extent these pathways explain or even contribute to the remarkable array of pigment patterns seen in wild animals.</s><s>Here we take advantage of the naturally occurring coat pattern of the African striped mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio (Muridae), to gain insights into the processes underlying the formation and evolution of mammalian stripes, a striking and characteristic pattern that has independently evolved in many taxa, including ungulates, carnivores, rodents, marsupials, lagomorphs, and primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , is often developmentally or seasonally regulated, and is thought to confer a fitness advantage in different species of vertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> Striped mice are diurnal, social rodents distributed throughout southwest Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and whose dorsal coat is characterized by the presence of four dark and two light dorsal longitudinal stripes arranged in a dark-light-dark pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1a</ref>).</s><s>To understand how this stripe pattern is formed, we first characterized the distribution of hair and hair types across the body.</s><s>In adult striped mice, hair can be classified into one of three phenotypic categories based on their individual pigment pattern -light: unpigmented shaft with a eumelanic base; black: completely eumelanic from tip to base, and banded: phaeomelanic (yellow) shaft and eumelanic (black) base (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1a</ref>).</s><s>We quantified the proportion of each hair category in different regions along the dorsoventral axis (middle stripe, dark stripe, light stripe, flank, and ventrum) and found that their proportions differed: the middle stripe and flank had similar proportions of all three hair types, but the light stripe contained mostly light hair, similar to what is seen in the ventrum, and the dark stripe contained mostly black hair (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, rather than by differences in pigment-type switching (pheomelanin vs. eumelanin), variation between light and dark stripes is largely determined by changes in the distribution of unpigmented (light) and eumelanic (black) hair.</s></p><p><s>To understand how such spatial differences arise, we examined skin development of striped mice between E16 and birth and observed stripe-like changes in both hair length and skin color (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a-d</ref>).</s><s>The hair length changes become apparent first, by embryonic day 19 (E19; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), but do not persist in adult animals (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2e</ref>); by contrast, the skin color changes become apparent at E22, creating a stable arrangement and appearance that persists as the animal grows (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1c</ref>).</s><s>At birth, both phenomena are present, and are correlated with respect to both morphology and gene expression (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the patterning mechanisms that underlie adult stripes begin during embryogenesis, and can be visualized by changes in organization of mesenchymal tissues.</s></p><p><s>By postnatal day 2 (P2), light and dark stripes exhibit similar levels of cell proliferation and hair follicle densities (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>); however, histological sections of skin show that hair follicles from the light stripe display a striking reduction in melanin deposition in the hair bulb relative to those from the dark stripe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1d</ref>).</s><s>Although hair follicles from both light and dark stripes contain pigment cells, as revealed by immunohistochemistry for KIT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1e</ref>), those from light stripes exhibit a striking reduction in immunohistochemistry against MITF, a key transcription factor that promotes melanocyte differentiation and melanogenic gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1f-h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The extent of KIT staining at the base of hair follicles was indistinguishable between dark and light stripes, despite the large differences in MITF staining and visible pigmentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1f-i</ref>).</s><s>We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the level of gene expression for key melanogenic genes and observed that the light stripe had lower expression of both Tyrosinase (Tyr) and Tyrosinase-related protein1 (Tyrp1) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1j</ref>).</s><s>This difference was confirmed using an enzymatic assay for tyrosinase activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1k</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results suggest that the differences in the proportions of black and light hair in dark and light stripes, respectively, are explained largely by differences in levels of Mitf, melanocyte differentiation, and melanogenic gene expression.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential expression of Alx3 between stripes</head><p><s>We used RNA-Seq to carry out an unbiased survey of transcriptome differences that correlate with stripe identity.</s><s>Three different regions of skin (light stripe, dark stripe, and flank) from each of three individuals were examined at each of four stages (E19, E22, P0, P2; n = 12; 36 libraries).</s><s>For E19, we used hair length as a proxy to mark and isolate incipient pigmentation stripes from E19 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>).</s><s>Our initial analyses were carried out using, as a reference, either the laboratory mouse genome or a striped mouse transcriptome that we assembled and annotated in-house.</s><s>The results from the two approaches exhibited considerable overlap but alignment to the de novo transcriptome reference captured a richer and more comprehensive differential signature (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4a-c</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), and is described in what follows.</s><s>Of more than 17000 genes that we annotated in the striped mouse transcriptome, 1062 exhibited significant differential expression between two regions (false discovery ratio (FDR) &lt; 0.1, using the negative binomial generalized linear model implemented in DESeq2, for which both stage and region are considered as factors).</s><s>The largest number of differentially expressed genes between regions was observed for the flank vs. the dark or the light stripe (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4d</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), which likely reflects a difference in body region or tissue composition rather than a color pattern-specific difference.</s><s>Among 36 genes significantly upregulated in the dark stripe vs. the light stripe, there is an obvious signature of melanocyte pigment production (Tyr, Tyrp1, Mc1r, Oca2, Gpr143, Trpm1) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5a</ref>, and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Several of these genes are direct targets of Mitf, but we did not observe a difference in Mitf mRNA levels between dark and light stripe skin, probably because Mitf is also expressed in non-pigmentary skin cells outside the hair follicle.</s></p><p><s>Among 28 genes significantly upregulated in the light vs. the dark stripe, a clear functional signature did not emerge; however, our attention was drawn to Alx3, which encodes a paired-class aristaless-like homeoprotein that has previously been implicated in fate specification of mesenchymal tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s><s>As described below, the temporal and spatial expression of Alx3 make it a strong candidate for regulating color differences among stripes; furthermore, Alx3 showed the highest fold differences in transcript abundance relative to dark stripe and the flank (6.73 and 4.32-fold, FDR 1.16*10 -17 and 4.09*10 -11 respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5b</ref>, and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further investigate a potential role of Alx3 in stripe patterning, we examined its spatial and temporal expression during skin development and stripe formation.</s><s>Quantitative RT-PCR showed that Alx3 mRNA is elevated in the incipient light vs. dark stripes at E19, increasing at E22 and then declining by P0 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b</ref>).</s><s>This pattern contrasts with that observed for other pigmentation-related genes including Asip, Edn3, Tyr, and Tyrp1 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) for which differential expression is not apparent until E22 or later.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alx3 is expressed in a new dorsal domain and in various cell types in the hair bulb</head><p><s>We used in situ hybridization to examine the expression of Alx3 during the early stages of skin development.</s><s>Previous work on Alx3 during embryogenesis (E10.5-E12.5) in laboratory mice (Mus) showed expression in neural crest-derived mesenchyme and in lateral plate mesoderm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>In sections from E13.5 and E15.5 laboratory mouse embryos, we confirmed this pattern of expression, observing Alx3 mRNA in lateral mesenchyme at E13.5, extending to and predominating in ventral mesenchyme by E15.5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2c</ref>).</s><s>A similar pattern is present in striped mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2d</ref>); however, striped mouse embryos show an additional domain of Alx3 expression in the developing dorsal skin (red arrowheads in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2d</ref>), which corresponds anatomically with the future position of the stripe domain.</s><s>At these early stages (E15), ALX3 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, as indicated by combined immunohistochemistry with E-cadherin, an epidermal compartment marker (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2e</ref>).</s><s>At P0, when Alx3 mRNA remains elevated in light vs. dark stripe skin, immunostaining with antisera for ALX3 reveals cells in developing dorsal hair bulbs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2f</ref>).</s><s>Combined immunostaining with antisera for S100 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2g</ref>), a marker for neural crest-derived cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , indicates that hair bulb expression of ALX3 includes melanocytes as well as keratinocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2f-h</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results indicate that establishment of a cellular compartment corresponding to the stripe domain occurs early during skin development, implicate Alx3 as a participating and/or responding factor in pattern establishment, and suggest multiple pathways-a direct effect on pigment cells and/or an indirect effect on hair bulb keratinocytes-through which alterations of melanocyte Mitf expression and pattern implementation may take place.</s></p></div>
