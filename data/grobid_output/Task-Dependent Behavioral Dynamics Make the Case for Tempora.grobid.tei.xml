E2 ϭ [Ϫ94, Ϫ45 ms], E3 ϭ [Ϫ85, Ϫ22 ms]).</s><s>However, in E1 they sampled A longer <ref type="bibr">([8, 49 ms]</ref>) and E4 showed no difference ([Ϫ45, 37 ms]).</s><s>Therefore, it is possible that rats use an extra sniff to ensure a reward (CSϩ) or mobilize response inhibition (CSϪ) in some GNG contexts, but such strategies are not consistent across conditions.</s><s>One alternative interpretation is that the background of response inhibition produces a cognitive load and slows decisions in GNG <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chambers et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Performance differences across tasks depended on experimental context.</s><s>When rats were trained and tested on one task (E1 and E2), GNG rats performed better than TAC rats (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>However, when rats learned both tasks (E3 and E4), subjects performed both tasks well (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Rats performed TAC at GNG levels in E3 and E4 without sniffing as long as GNG (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, longer sampling durations may not be necessary for high performance in TAC when rats also know GNG.</s><s>The GNG context could engage extra learning, which helps when performing TAC.</s></p><p><s>Rats altered sampling durations across odor sets in E1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), as shown in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abraham et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abraham et al., , 2012))</ref>.</s><s>We may have lacked power to detect differences in E2-E4 (E1 was our largest sample).</s><s>Alternatively, it is possible that we did not use a large enough spread of discrimination difficulties to see this effect in all experiments (Extreme odor set was used only in E1 and E2).</s><s>In E1 there was a significant difference between the shortest and longest sampling duration odor sets (S2 and Extreme), suggesting that rats adjust sampling times for discrimination difficulty even in TAC.</s><s>That we did not see this difference in E2-E4 suggests that rats can do most monomolecular and mixture discriminations with similar sampling durations and extend times only when odors are very similar (Extreme).</s><s>Another interpretation is that rats are satisfied with their performance for a given odor set once they reach some arbitrary performance level, what we have referred to as "good enough" performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kay et al., 2006)</ref>, and this level may change dependent on task parameters and a trade-off with cognitive load.</s></p><p><s>Sampling duration was significantly correlated with performance at the session level in three of the four experiments, which argues for temporal integration in odor sampling.</s><s>The one experiment (E1) in which we found no effect using GLS statistical models was that in which we tested rats for only 3 d on each odor set.</s><s>We did not test these rats as long on each odor set as in E2-E4, so that we could probe performance and other variables given the same amount of training across tasks and odor sets.</s><s>Temporal integration may show up more strongly in GLS statistics when rats perform more sessions and have a chance to increase performance more.</s><s>However conditional probability plots for pooled trials in E1 do show evidence that performance increases with sampling duration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>.i,b.i).</s></p><p><s>The term temporal integration assumes that some type of information is accumulating over time.</s><s>We have not proved that this happens, although we have argued for it based on conditional probability plots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>It is indeed possible that sampling longer allows rats to make better decisions via some other mechanism.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Role of reward schedule</head><p><s>Reward schedule (half or full) had, by design, a large influence on reward frequency, but task and performance effects and other variables often erased predicted frequency differences.</s><s>Response delays showed a possible interaction with apparently opposite effects on reward in the two tasks, but pairwise differences were not significant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Reward schedule affected the time to initiate trials for GNG but not TAC; GNG rats initiated trials more slowly in the Full versus Half reward conditions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Reward intervals also varied across tasks and reward conditions.</s><s>TAC rats showed almost double the reward interval for Half relative to Full reward, as predicted from the experimental design, but GNG rats' reward intervals did not vary across reward conditions.</s></p><p><s>Thus, reward schedules within commonly designed GNG and TAC tasks can have complex effects on rats' behavioral strategies.</s><s>That reward schedule did not influence performance or sampling duration was surprising given strong task differences in these measures and reward schedule effects on response and start delays, but such effects may emerge with different task parameters.</s></p><p><s>Different strategies, same cognitive system?</s><s>Conditional probability plots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) show what appear to be underlying psychometric functions for both tasks.</s><s>Because rats did not choose sampling times uniformly across all durations, we cannot use these plots to show that for each subject sniffing longer results in better performance.</s><s>We rely on pooled data for a more qualitative picture, and group-level GLS statistics provide evidence that rats do integrate olfactory information over time in both tasks.</s><s>GNG and TAC strategies may then be viewed as different parameter ranges of the same underlying cognitive system, which may be supported by a unified underlying neural system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Frederick et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our data show that many features of a task can affect behavioral outcomes, so we cannot claim that the results presented here are the final word on task differences in odor-discrimination behavior.</s><s>It is possible that more extreme manipulations of reward probability, intertrial interval, and penalty delays could press rats to adopt different sampling strategies depending upon what, if anything, they are attempting to optimize.</s><s>These tests are the object of future studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of task selection</head><p><s>Our results support temporal integration across olfactory tasks, where sniffing longer gives rats a better chance of making a correct response.</s><s>This shows that olfactory decisions are similar to other sensory decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gold and Shadlen, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Despite many similarities, there were important differences between GNG and TAC tasks, sampling duration being the most robust.</s><s>These results help reconcile previous studies, performed in different laboratories, in which longer sampling times were seen in GNG tasks.</s><s>That previous TAC studies did not find evidence of temporal integration suggests that an aspect of training or test parameters did not encourage subjects to use their entire behavioral range.</s><s>These results show that more experiments and research should focus on the impact or interaction of the particular behavioral task on cognitive interpretations in research.</s><s>Indeed, if we had only used one of the tasks, we would have come to radically different conclusions about rats' behavioral strategies and abilities when performing odor discriminations.</s><s>Researchers must take care to use multiple behaviors and parameters if they wish to draw general conclusions beyond a particular task.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Experiment design.</s><s>A, Each column lists the type of behavior, odor sets, and design used for each experiment.</s><s>The symbols next to each experiment are those used in the following figures.</s><s>The odor sets and odors used are identified in Table1.</s><s>E1 and E2 were between-subjects designs (rats learned 1 task).</s><s>E3 and E4 were within-subjects designs (rats learned both tasks).</s><s>B, Schematic of the behavioral panels used.</s><s>For both tasks, there is a center odor port.</s><s>When rats stick their noses into the port, odor is delivered for as long as they remain in the port.</s><s>For GNG, there is a single response port (A) in which a rat makes a response to odor A.
