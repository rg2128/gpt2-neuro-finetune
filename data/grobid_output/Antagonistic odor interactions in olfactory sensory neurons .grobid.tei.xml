<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Antagonism measured in the glomerular layer of the OB.</s><s>Odor responses in OSNs can be measured with excellent sensitivity in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, where axons of a given receptor type converge, allowing signal averaging.</s><s>We used OMP-GCaMP3 mice and imaged axonal calcium responses through a cranial window over the dorsal surface of both olfactory bulbs.</s><s>For two odorants, Methyl tiglate and Isobutyl propionate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), we measured odor responses in glomeruli across a range of concentrations spanning three orders of magnitude.</s><s>We then made a binary mixture of the two odorants and measured OSN responses at the same glomeruli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>When plotting the responses as a function of concentration, the mixture concentration at each point represents the sum of the two individual odors-this applies to all experiments where concentration series are used.</s><s>From nine mice, we identified 334 glomeruli that responded to either of the odors, or the mixture of the two.</s><s>For this odor pair, many glomeruli reached different saturation levels for the same odor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To estimate antagonism at each glomerulus, we first calculated the average response to the three highest odor concentrations of each individual odor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>We then tested whether the observed mixture responses for the same three concentrations were significantly below the linear sum of the response to the mixture components (rank-sum test of trial replicates).</s><s>Significant mixture suppression was found in 80.5% (277/344) of glomeruli that responded to at least one odor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>There are, however, two important considerations in interpreting our result.</s><s>First, it remains possible that the largest calcium signals observed for individual odors may represent the average maximum physiologically-bounded firing rate across all OSNs of a common type.</s><s>Similarly, the largest signals we observed for individual odors may be bounded by calcium indicator saturation.</s><s>Given these constraints, it is plausible that the observed mixture responses can never reach the linear sum of the two mixture components and are simply bounded by the largest response observed for either component alone.</s><s>To account for this possibility, we compared the observed mixture responses and maximum response for either odor.</s><s>When using this more conservative metric, we found evidence for antagonism in 41.7% (144/344) of the glomeruli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e-f</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that, even by a conservative measure, antagonism is widespread in OSNs.</s><s>Lastly, to ensure that our observations were not only relevant to the highest odor concentrations, we measured the fraction of antagonistic interactions on a sliding scale (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>We found that regardless of odor concentration, antagonism was present in a constant fraction of glomeruli.</s><s>These data cannot be easily explained by one-step competitive binding models, and provide further evidence that odorant-binding to and activation of odor receptors may be decoupled, as predicted by our earlier theoretical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>In these experiments, glomerular responses were highly nonoverlapping for the odor pair tested.</s><s>To ensure that antagonism did not arise from unique interactions between these two odors, and to demonstrate generalization of the phenomenon with other odor pairs, we repeated our experiments using another odor pair, Ethyl valerate and Allyl butyrate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>;

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>The fraction of cells that showed mixture suppression was smaller than in the glomerular data, which may be attributed to noise from two sources.</s><s>First, the measured signal at glomeruli represents the population response across all ~10,000 OSNs of a common subtype, compared with single OSN cell bodies in the epithelium imaging.</s><s>The second source of noise may arise from image acquisition, through the number of pixels contributing to the measured signal.</s><s>While we typically imaged 10-20 densely packed glomeruli per field of view, in the epithelium, we imaged dozens to hundreds of sparsely arranged cells, thereby substantially reducing the number of pixels contributing to our signal.</s></p><p><s>To ensure that our observations did not arise from more noisy measurements at the single-cell level, we measured the fraction of mixture responses that exceeded the linear prediction of the mixture components, a phenomenon known as synergy.</s><s>We first measured the fraction of mixture responses that exceeded maximum of either of the mixture components.</s><s>We found only 11.8% (114/964) of OSNs exceeded the maximum response of either component (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>); however, it should be noted that for synergy to occur the measured OSN response should exceed the linear summation of the response of both odor components.</s><s>In our dataset, we found only 5/964 cells where the mixture response was significantly greater than the sum of the mixture components.</s><s>Both fractions are well below those we measure for antagonism and consistent with previous reports that antagonism is the predominant mixture interaction when compared with synergy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We also fit the odor responses in individual OSNs and compared the extracted Hill coefficients to those obtained by imaging populations of OSN at their axon terminals (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We predicted that the fits for individual OSNs may be sharper, and therefore have larger Hill coefficients than glomerular fits because measurements from glomeruli average hundreds of OSNs that may have heterogenous odor sensitivities.</s><s>However, when we made these comparisons, we found no difference between individual OSN and glomerular Hill coefficients for the same odors (Methyl tiglate, OSN mean = 3.31 ± 0.76, n = 6, glomerular mean = 2.67 ± 0.16, n = 48;

.</s></p><p><s>One form of interaction is where binary (and larger) mixtures tend to have reduced perceived intensity (suppression).</s><s>Odors can also be masked or harder to identify in mixtures, which could be due to reduced sensation of specific components.</s><s>The origin of this perceptual odor suppression in mixtures is uncertain.</s><s>Some of it could arise at the periphery, including at the receptors themselves.</s><s>We recently proposed a simple model based on the two-step activation of odorant receptors, and noted that even a modest decorrelation of binding affinity and activation efficacy across odors could lead to antagonistic interactions, which will lead to mixture suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>In other words, odors that bind the most tightly to odor receptors may not strongly activate the odor receptor complex and the downstream signaling cascade that ultimately generates OSN output.</s></p><p><s>Here, we have used direct imaging of OSN somata, as well as more conventional glomerular imaging, to show that mixture suppression (by inference antagonistic interactions) is widespread.</s><s>We adapted a method first reported by Iwata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , to directly image the somata of OSNs in vivo, in freely breathing mice.</s><s>We obtained responses of OSNs to a diverse array of odorants and found that the statistics of population responses were similar to that obtained for glomeruli.</s><s>Interestingly, inhibitory responses were more easily detected in glomeruli than in OSN cell bodies, which might reflect glomerular averaging of heterogeneous responses of OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>This OSN imaging method is likely to be valuable for understanding the fundamental properties of sensory coding and modulation at the periphery, especially with chronic imaging.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies using binary mixture stimuli have offered

.</s><s>Recently, we offered a principled explanation for all these different effects using a model that decouples the binding affinity of odorants to receptors and their activation efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Then, depending on the statistics of these properties in the repertoire of odorants encountered by an animal, the population of odorant receptors could exhibit varying degrees of antagonism or synergy.</s></p><p><s>In this work, we used binary mixtures and concentration variation over three orders of magnitude, to find that suppressive mixture interactions were remarkably widespread.</s><s>We first demonstrated mixture suppression with glomerular imaging.</s><s>Since glomerular responses are averages of many hundreds of OSN axons, they will overlook any heterogeneity.</s><s>Glomerular responses may also be influenced by lateral interactions within the olfactory bulb networks, particularly due to GABAb-mediated presynaptic inhibition that can alter OSN calcium signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s><s>However, there is strong evidence that GABAb-mediated reduction of OSN responses are largely intraglomerular <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , which will simply serve as an automatic gain control, hence insensitive to the identity of the odorant.</s><s>As an additional check, we chose two distinct odor mixtures with differing extents of overlap in glomerular activation.</s><s>We found remarkably similar mixture effects for both pairs of odorants, which indicates that lateral interactions among glomeruli are unlikely to affect our conclusions.</s></p><p><s>To circumvent circuit and feedback interactions, we imaged OSNs directly and found that binary mixture suppression was just as widespread as observed with glomerular imaging.</s><s>Since these interactions were observed at the earliest stages of odor encoding, in OSNs, the most likely source of mixture

Going</s><s>beyond binary mixtures, we used odor blends of increasing complexity, up to 12 components, to ask how mixture responses compared with the expected linear summation of individual responses (below saturation).</s><s>This allowed us to ask how OSNs respond to more complex mixtures.</s><s>It has been previously hypothesized that such nonlinearities in peripheral coding may be a mechanism to increase precision and specificity of encoding complex odor stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, using more naturalistic odor delivery conditions, we found that the degree of mixture suppression was greater with increasing number of components, which is expected from statistical consideration of antagonistic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>This feature can be rationalized as increasing normalization of population responses, which we have shown previously to allow greater information transfer about odor identity, when saturation threatens degradation of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>An important point regarding the odors we used in this study is that many of the odors share common molecular features (e.g., ester groups).</s><s>A reasonable assumption is that there should be some molecular overlap between odors for antagonism to occur, due to the necessity of interactions between odor molecules and the binding pocket of olfactory receptors.</s><s>However, in our panel we did include several odors that did not contain an ester group.</s><s>When these non-ester odors were delivered as binary mixtures, in combination with ester containing odors, mixture suppression was still observed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s><s>These additional data, along with our previous observation that narrowly tuned ORNs show strong mixture suppression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7d</ref>), argue that antagonism is indeed a fundamental feature of mixture encoding in ORNs and is not a unique feature restricted to those that are sensitive to a single functional group.</s></p><p><s>Beyond our theoretical observations, there are other more recent experimental studies that report related effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> .</s><s>Our work is unique in the following regard: (1) we report responses from a large set of OSNs in intact, freely breathing mice, responding to vapor phase odorants inhaled physiologically, (2) we report fast, real-time responses with a variety of odorants and using both OSN and glomerular imaging and (3) we report responses to mixtures of high complexity (up to 12 odors), well beyond just binary mixtures.</s></p><p><s>Given this widespread existence of normalization, what advantage would a similar phenomenon at the level of sensory transduction itself confer to the system?</s><s>First order stimulus processing within the olfactory bulb is critically related to the activity of OSN inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> .</s><s>Having normalization occur early in the sensory hierarchy helps avoid saturation early on and preserve more information about the stimulus to be conveyed downstream.</s><s>Indeed, in our previous work, we demonstrated using information theoretic calculations that a target odorant embedded in a complex mixture can be more easily detected with antagonistic interactions that lead to sparser representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>The improved performance with antagonism exists for a wide range of receptor tuning widths (i.e., the average number of activated glomeruli per single odorant).</s><s>Importantly, normalization at the level of receptors leading to sparser, more informative representation, comes for free without additional circuit burden.</s></p></div>
