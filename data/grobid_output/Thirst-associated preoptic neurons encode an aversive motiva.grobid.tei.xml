rectification and Cl -over I -selectivity deviate from VRAC (13) Drosophila dBest1, a member of a family of Ca 2+ -activated Cl --channels, mediates swelling-activated Cl -currents in insect cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>, but their characteristics differ from VRAC currents and the mammalian homolog of dBest1 is swelling-insensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>We show that VRAC represents a distinct class of anion channels that also conduct organic osmolytes.</s></p><p><s>To identify VRAC, we opted for a genome-wide RNA interference screen that could identify non-redundant VRAC components.</s><s>Swelling-induced iodide influx into HEK cells expressing the iodide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein YFP(H148Q/I152L) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> was used as read-out in a fluorometric imaging plate reader (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>Exposure to saline containing 50 mM iodide entailed a slow fluorescence decay under isotonic conditions, whereas hypotonicity induced a delayed increase in YFP quenching (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>) that could be reduced by VRAC inhibitors like carbenoxolone <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>In a prescreen targeting 21 anion transporters (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>), only siRNAs against the Cl -/HCO 3 -exchanger AE2 gave significant effects (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).</s><s>They decreased iodide influx under both isotonic and hypotonic conditions.</s></p><p><s>Our genome-wide screen utilized three separately transfected siRNAs per gene (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Offline data analysis (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S3</ref>, A and B) yielded the maximal slope of fluorescence quenching that was used to define hits.</s><s>Further criteria included the presence of predicted transmembrane domains and a wide expression pattern.</s><s>87 genes (table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) were taken into a secondary screen with independent siRNAs.</s><s>Of these, only suppression of LRRC8A robustly slowed hypotonicity-induced YFP quenching (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>LRRC8A knock-down also strongly suppressed I Cl(swell) in patch-clamp experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, D to F), suggesting that the multispan membrane protein LRRC8A is an indispensable component of VRAC or is needed for its activation.</s></p><p><s>Although LRRC8A reached the plasma membrane (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S4A</ref> for HeLa cells), its transfection into HEK cells rather decreased I Cl(swell) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>).</s><s>We hypothesized that VRAC contains LRRC8A as part of a heteromer and that LRRC8A overexpression led to a subunit stoichiometry that was incompatible with channel activity.</s><s>LRRC8A has four closely related homologs (LRRC8B -LRRC8E) which all have four predicted transmembrane domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>.</s><s>EST databases suggested that all homologs were widely expressed.</s></p><p><s>Immunocytochemistry of transfected HeLa cells (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S4A</ref>) and of native HEK cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, G and H) detected LRRC8A at the plasma membrane.</s><s>Truncation of its carboxy-terminus as in a patient with agammaglobulinemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> led to cytoplasmic retention (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S4B</ref>).</s><s>LRRC8B through LRRC8E remained intracellular when transfected alone, but reached the plasma membrane when co-transfected with LRRC8A (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, I and J, fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S4</ref>, C to H).</s><s>Unlike LRRC8A transfection, LRRC8A/LRRC8C co-expression did not suppress I Cl(swell) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>However, neither this co-expression, nor any other combination tested, significantly increased current amplitudes above WT levels.</s></p><p><s>We used zinc-finger nuclease and CRISPR/Cas <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> technologies to constitutively disrupt LRRC8 genes.</s><s>Besides polyploid HEK cells we used stably diploid human HCT116 cells for increased disruption efficiency.</s><s>Gene disruption was confirmed by sequencing and Western blots (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S3</ref>).</s><s>To exclude off-target effects, we generated two HEK and three HCT116 lines in which LRRC8A was disrupted at different positions (tables S3 and S4).</s></p><p><s>I Cl(swell) was abolished in all five lines and could be rescued by LRRC8A transfection (Fig. <ref type="figure">2,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref> and C, and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S5</ref>), proving that LRRC8A is essential for I Cl(swell) .</s><s>We also produced HCT116 cells in which other LRRC8 genes were disrupted singly or in combinations, including a line with disruption of all five LRRC8 genes (henceforth called LRRC8 -/-cells).</s><s>Except for LRRC8A, disruption of single LRRC8 genes did not abolish VRAC currents (Fig. <ref type="figure">2, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>LRRC8A transfection into quintuple KO LRRC8 -/-cells failed to rescue I Cl(swell) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref> and F), agreeing with the absence of I Cl(swell) in LRRC8(B/C/D/E) -/-cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, B and C).</s><s>Cotransfecting LRRC8 -/-cells with LRRC8A and either LRRC8C or LRRC8E yielded I Cl(swell) with current densities similar to native cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2F</ref>).</s><s>Co-expressing LRRC8A with LRRC8D yielded lower currents (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, E and F).</s><s>No current was observed upon LRRC8A+B coexpression, which may relate to the poor expressibility of LRRC8B (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, D and F).</s><s>These findings fit to the low currents of LRRC8(C/E) -/-cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>) where LRRC8A can only interact with poorly expressible LRRC8B and/or LRRC8D.</s><s>Reconstituted I Cl(swell) activated like WT VRAC upon swelling (Fig. <ref type="figure">2E</ref>) and displayed its typical anion permeability sequence (fig.</s></p></div>

the faster I Cl(swell) inactivation in LRRC8C -/-cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, B and D, and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S6D</ref>) in which the 'decelerating' LRRC8C

HCT116 cells expressed LRRC8A through LRRC8E, whereas LRRC8E was almost absent from HL-60 cells (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, HCT116 cells, whose I Cl(swell) inactivates more than that of HEK cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, B and D, and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S6D</ref>), express less 'decelerating' LRRC8C than HEK (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>LRRC8 proteins have four predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) followed by hydrophilic C-termini with up to 17 leucine-rich repeats <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> (hence LRRC8 = leucine-rich repeat containing 8) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>).</s><s>Their C-termini were originally thought to be extracellular <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>, but proteome databases revealed (20) that the TMD2-TMD3 linker can be phosphorylated and suggested that LRRC8 N-and C-termini are cytoplasmic (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>LRRC8 proteins display weak homology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> to pannexins, pore-forming proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> with connexin-like topology.</s><s>Connexins form hexameric hemichannels and gap junctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This similarity suggested (20) that LRRC8 proteins form hexameric channels for so far unknown substrates.</s><s>Just like VRAC currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>, LRRC8 proteins are found in vertebrates, but not in other phyla like arthropoda <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We ascertained the pannexin-and connexin-like transmembrane topology of LRRC8A.</s></p><p><s>Mutating potential N-linked glycosylation sites between TMD1 and TMD2 abolished the size shift upon PNGaseF treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>), demonstrating that this loop is extracellular.</s></p><p><s>Immunofluorescence of cells transfected with HA-tagged LRRC8A constructs showed that the TMD3-4 segment is extracellular and the C-terminus cytoplasmic (Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The formation of LRRC8 heteromers was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from HEK cells transfected with LRRC8A and epitope-tagged versions of either LRRC8B, C, D, or E.</s></p><p><s>LRRC8A co-precipitated each of the other isoforms, but not the Cl --channel ClC-1 used as control (Fig. <ref type="figure">3, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, precipitation of epitope-tagged versions of LRRC8B through LRRC8E brought down LRRC8A (Fig. <ref type="figure">3F</ref>).</s><s>Co-precipitation of LRRC8 isoforms was also observed for native HEK cells (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S8</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Hypotonicity induced a robust taurine efflux from HEK and HCT116 cell lines, but not from their LRRC8A -/-derivates (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref> and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S9A</ref>) where it could be rescued by LRRC8A/LRRC8C co-transfection (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S9B</ref> for HEK).</s><s>Taurine efflux was also abolished in LRRC8(B/C/D/E) -/-HCT116 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</s><s>Since both I Cl(swell) and swelling-induced taurine efflux similarly depended on LRRC8 heteromers, VRAC is most likely identical to VSOAC, the volume-stimulated organic osmolyte/anion channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, LRRC8A -/-HEK cells showed severely impaired volume regulation.</s><s>After initial swelling, WT, but not LRCC8A -/- cells slowly reduced their cell volume in the continuous presence of extracellular hypotonicity (Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>).</s><s>Hence, LRRC8-containing VSOAC is a major player in RVD.</s></p><p><s>The identification of LRRC8 proteins as crucial VRAC constituents ends a decades-long hunt for the elusive molecular identity of this important channel.</s><s>The absence of I Cl(swell) upon genomic disruption of LRRC8A and its rescue by transient re-expression identified LRRC8A</s></p><p><s>as an indispensable component of VRAC, or alternatively as being crucial for its activation.</s></p><p><s>The wide expression pattern of LRRC8 genes and the plasma membrane residency of LRRC8A-containing heteromers are fulfilled prerequisites for LRRC8 proteins forming the channel.</s><s>The dependence of current properties on LRRC8 isoform combinations indicated that LRRC8 heteromers are integral components of VRAC, a notion buttressed by the homology of LRRC8 proteins to pannexins.</s><s>Since co-transfection of LRRC8 isoforms failed to significantly increase I Cl(swell) amplitude over WT levels other factors limit VRAC activity.</s><s>Such a limiting component might be an auxiliary subunit of VRAC or could be part of the signaling cascade leading to its activation.</s><s>Indeed VRAC currents seem to be highly regulated, with amplitudes differing only 2-3fold across cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The homology between LRRC8 proteins and pannexins suggested that LRRC8 proteins form hexameric channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>We confirmed the pannexin-like topology of LRRC8A and propose that VRAC is formed by LRRC8 hexamers of LRRC8A and minimally one other family member.</s><s>In this model, VRAC may contain two to five different LRRC8 isoforms.</s><s>This could create a large variety of VRAC channels with different properties.</s><s>The variation of I Cl(swell) inactivation kinetics between different tissues and cells (3) can now be ascribed to different expression ratios of LRRC8 isoforms.</s><s>LRRC8-dependent Cl --and taurine-fluxes indicated that VRAC is identical to VSOAC (6) and fit to a pore formed by LRRC8 hexamers because hexameric pannexin channels likewise display poor substrate specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our work provides the basis to explore the structure-function relationship of VRAC/VSOAC, to clarify the signal transduction from cell volume increase to channel opening, and to investigate the role of the channel in basic cellular processes like cell division, growth, and migration and in various pathological states.</s><s>Interestingly, a truncating LRRC8A mutation has been described in a patient with agammaglobulinemia (21) and LRRC8C may have a role in fat metabolism <ref type="bibr"

plate.</s><s>After pipetting, the fluorescence acutely changed to new values that were more or less stable for about 30 s before swelling-induced quenching of YFP set in.</s><s>We averaged fluorescence values from measurements 9 to 12 to obtain F abs start which was subsequently used for normalization.</s><s>F abs fin was defined as averaged fluorescence from the four last measurements and we set another warning flag if fluorescence had not reached quasi-steady-state at the end of the measurement.</s><s>F abs fin might be used for background subtraction.</s><s>We preferred, however, to subtract F BG TX100 , the averaged (over the last 300 s) fluorescence of the four control wells from the same plate that had been exposed to Triton X100 to maximally quench YFP fluorescence.</s><s>The background-subtracted fluorescence value of each well was then normalized to the corresponding F abs start value to yield F* (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S3B</ref>).</s><s>siRNA-mediated knock-down of VRAC should reduce iodide current magnitude, but not necessarily the final intracellular iodide concentration (reflected in F abs fin ).</s><s>Although not being a linear function of iodide influx, the speed of YFP quenching after exposure to hypotonicity is the best indicator for the magnitude of VRAC currents.</s><s>We therefore determined the slope of fluorescence change by linear regression of 11 points in a sliding window between 35 and 350 s.</s><s>The maximum of these slopes was defined as S max .</s><s>The intersection of the corresponding linear regression line with F*=1 defined t onset as a measure for the speed of response to the hypotonic challenge, a delay that might be changed e.g. by interfering with the signal transduction cascade leading to VRAC opening (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S3B</ref>).</s><s>For each individual plate we then calculated the mean maximal slope S max mean of all experimental wells and the corresponding standard deviation.</s><s>S max of each individual siRNA-treated well was expressed in terms of standard deviations to yield Z-scores, with e.g.</s><s>Z=2 meaning that the slope is slower by two standard deviations compared to the average of the plate.</s></p><p><s>siRNAs leading to cell death or targeting YFP confirmed that results of none of the 384-well plates had to be discarded because of low transfection efficiency.</s><s>Results were sorted by genes and listed individually for each of the three siRNAs (which generally were on different plates) the Z-score, t onset , F abs ante , F abs fin , the low-cell and the non-steady-state flags (1 or 0).</s><s>It also listed the protein families associated with the gene products (as obtained from UniProtKB database (32)), the genes' tissue expression pattern (as determined by publicly available microarray data <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>) and predicted number of transmembrane domains that was calculated by the software TMHMM 2.0c <ref type="bibr">(34)</ref>.</s><s>Comparison of the first and replicate screen showed that the effects of individual siRNAs on the respective Z-scores of S max correlated reasonably well and demonstrated the usefulness of our warning flags (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S3, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>To account for different efficiencies of siRNA knock-down with the three individual siRNAs against each gene, some of which may be ineffective or show off-target effects, we sorted our results according to the mean Z obtained with the two 'best' siRNAs (giving the largest values of Z).</s></p><p><s>As expected, many of the hits could be ruled out by one or more criteria.</s><s>For instance, siRNAs against several ribosomal proteins led to large Z-scores that were caused by poor cell growth or cell death as indicated by the 'low cell' flag.</s><s>Large Z-scores that were not reproduced in the replicate screen could sometimes be eliminated by examining the photographs of the plates which showed dirt at the respective well that had caused high background fluorescence.</s><s>As we were looking for the channel itself and not for proteins involved in the activation of VRAC, we limited our search to proteins having at least one predicted transmembrane domain.</s><s>Many candidates could be eliminated by their wellestablished function or their inclusion in well-known gene families like olfactory receptors or other G-protein coupled receptors.</s><s>However, as annotations are not always reliable and as proteins may serve more than one function, several candidates whose annotated function appeared to be incompatible with VRAC function but which otherwise seemed promising were earmarked for a secondary screen.</s><s>As VRAC currents have been observed in every mammalian tissue that has been investigated, we excluded candidates that showed a narrow tissue distribution or very low expression levels as indicated by NCBI EST profile databases or the scientific literature, except when they belonged to a gene family whose overlapping expression pattern covered many tissues.</s></p><p><s>On the basis of these criteria 87 candidate genes (table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) were selected for a secondary screen that used again the FLIPR TM assay with pools of four siRNAs (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA, Thermo Scientific) that were different from the ones used in the primary screen.</s><s>Of these genes, only LRRC8A passed the test.</s><s>The SMART pool directed against LRRC8A slowed hypotonicity-induced quenching of YFP fluorescence better than the SMART-pool against AE2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>It is interesting to note that LRRC8A was at the 222 nd position of hits sorted exclusively by the mean Z-score averaged across both screens from the 2 out of 3 siRNAs per gene that gave the best score.</s><s>Only one of the three siRNAs against LRRC8A gave a Z-score for maximal slope of ~2, the two others were below 1 (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S3E</ref>).</s></p></div>
