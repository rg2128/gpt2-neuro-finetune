<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Instability of Hebbian STDP without homeostasis.</s><s>While many studies have investigated the dynamics of balanced networks with fixed connection weights, few have investigated the case of plastic synapses.</s><s>We simulated a model cortical network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, supplemented with plasticity rules that modified connections onto excitatory neurons (see Methods).</s><s>The network was composed of 4,000 adaptive exponential integrateand-fire excitatory neurons and 1,000 integrate-and-fire inhibitory neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> coupled randomly with a connection probability of 0.2.</s><s>Excitatory-to-excitatory synapses were governed by a voltage-based STDP rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, top).</s><s>The STDP rule captured the dependence of long-term depression and potentiation on firing rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, bottom), so that neurons that exhibited correlated rate fluctuations tended to recruit longterm potentiation.</s></p><p><s>We investigated whether external stimuli could modify the network's structure and dynamics through STDP.</s><s>We began with a network with a homogeneous weight structure.</s><s>The network exhibited irregular and asynchronous firing due to a balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Neuronal assemblies did not form spontaneously, as the uniformly low firing rates tended to recruit depression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>To investigate how this connectivity could be modified by the application of external stimuli, we defined a set of 20 stimulus patterns, which when active corresponded to an increased excitatory drive to neurons targeted by that pattern.</s><s>Neurons were targeted by each pattern with a probability of 0.05.</s><s>Consequently, the number of stimuli targeting each neuron was binomially distributed.</s><s>Approximately 36% of neurons were not targeted, 38% were targeted by one stimulus and 26% were targeted by multiple stimuli.</s><s>For each stimulus i ¼ 1, 2, y, 20, we refer to those neurons targeted by the stimulus as neuronal assembly i.</s></p><p><s>Stimuli were presented sequentially in repeated presentation blocks.</s><s>Each stimulus presentation increased the external drive to targeted neurons by 8 kHz, which may be interpreted as an increase in the firing rate of 1,000 presynaptic neurons by 8 Hz each, on average.</s><s>Stimulus presentations lasted 1 s, with 3-s gaps between stimuli (see Methods).</s><s>Stimuli recruited increased firing rates in subsets of the network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>However, as has been reported in previous studies of balanced networks with STDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , after a few tens of stimulus applications, the network firing rate increased abruptly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) and exhibited high frequency oscillations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) that reflected a loss of stability of the asynchronous balanced state.</s><s>These dynamics were due to runaway positive feedback of Hebbian STDP during training <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, such instability has precluded the development of realistic models of stimulus-evoked plasticity in such systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Our study investigates homeostatic mechanisms for synaptic plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , which regulate network activity, preventing this instability and producing spontaneous dynamics consistent with experimental data from cortex.</s></p><p><s>Formation of neuronal assemblies.</s><s>We implemented a recently proposed symmetric Hebbian STDP rule that acted on inhibitory to excitatory synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>This inhibitory synaptic plasticity (iSTDP) controlled the firing rate of excitatory neurons, as frequently firing neurons recruited more inhibition, while low-firing rate neurons recruited less inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> We also normalized the total excitatory conductance onto any neuron <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , thus imposing competition between synapses (note that our results hold for a variety of soft normalization time scales; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We recorded W in , the average synaptic strength of connections in each of the 20 neuronal assemblies.</s><s>During the training period, this quantity increased as stimuli were presented, until synapses between neurons in the same assembly were strongly potentiated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Due to the normalization of excitatory conductance, W out decreased slightly on average (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, bottom).</s><s>Despite this reorganization, the average excitatory firing rate after training did not diverge, stabilizing at B1.7 Hz (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Besides modifying synaptic weights, training also changed the network's spontaneous dynamics.</s><s>The clustered excitatory connectivity led to transient activations of previously stimulated neuronal assemblies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>,e; Supplementary Movie 1).</s><s>These high-firing rate activations occurred over a time scale of hundreds of milliseconds.</s><s>However, due to infrequent activations, the timeaveraged firing rates of individual neurons remained low, consistent with recordings from spontaneous cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>We conclude that the network reorganizes its connections in response to stimulus presentation, and that this reorganization substantially modifies spontaneous dynamics to reflect prior stimuli.</s><s>We refer to these new dynamics as structured spontaneous activity, in contrast to the uncorrelated activity in the homogeneously connected network.</s></p><p><s>Effects of homeostatic inhibitory plasticity.</s><s>Under the iSTDP rule, inhibitory synapses were potentiated when the postsynaptic excitatory neuron fired above a target firing rate and depressed otherwise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>As a result, the rule homeostatically regulated the distribution of excitatory firing rates in the network towards this target value.</s><s>We next investigate how this mechanism permits stable formation of assemblies.</s></p><p><s>A frequently encountered challenge in networks with multiple stable states is winner-take-all dynamics, in which a single stable state, typically characterized by a specific subset of neuronal subpopulations with high firing rates, is dominant <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In such networks, high-firing rate subpopulations suppress the rest of the network, preventing other neurons from responding to inputs or exhibiting strong spontaneous fluctuations.</s><s>In general, finetuning of parameters is needed to avoid these pathological states <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To robustly prevent winner-take-all dynamics, a mechanism by which high-firing rate neurons are suppressed is necessary.</s><s>The iSTDP rule satisfies this requirement.</s><s>Indeed, after training, certain assemblies received more inhibition than others (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>).</s><s>This heterogeneity prevented winner-take-all dynamics during training.</s><s>Blocking iSTDP led to less potentiation for stimulated assemblies (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>) and spontaneous activity in which only a single assembly exhibited high firing rates (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, we conclude iSTDP is necessary to prevent winner-take-all dynamics that would eventually lead to a degradation of connectivity between suppressed assemblies.</s></p><p><s>Stability of learned connectivity.</s><s>We next examined the stability of the network architecture during structured spontaneous activity.</s><s>Many studies have examined how different synaptic dynamics can affect the stability of learned connectivity in the face of random spontaneous firing, employing models that include, for example, cascades of synaptic states 38 or metaplasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>We took a complementary approach, asking whether the modification of network dynamics after training could be beneficial for the persistence of the learned architecture compared with the random firing case.</s><s>We reasoned that structured spontaneous activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>) could consolidate the learned assembly structure, in line with proposals that link memory stability to reactivation during sleep or quiet wakefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We therefore compared the trained recurrent network with a hypothetical non-recurrent network without structured spontaneous activity.</s><s>Both networks began with the same initial trained weight matrix and exhibited the same firing rates (see Methods).</s><s>However, in the non-recurrent network, synaptic plasticity modified the weight matrix depending on neurons' spike times, but excitatory spikes did not cause excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in postsynaptic targets (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, excitatory inputs were purely external and uncorrelated, which prevented coordinated assembly activation.</s><s>We measured W in over a period of spontaneous activity in the two models.</s><s>In the non-recurrent network, W in decayed faster than in the recurrent network with structured spontaneous activity (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>, compare black and yellow curves), despite the fact that neurons fired at the same rates in both networks.</s><s>This suggests that the particular timing of assembly activation during structured spontaneous activity prevents degradation of learned network connectivity.</s></p><p><s>To further probe the effect of structured spontaneous activity, we perturbed W in , reducing it by 10% for one assembly, and analysed the resulting dynamics.</s><s>After the perturbation, W in increased for that assembly, showing that structured spontaneous activity can retrain a network if its architecture is weakly disrupted (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>, black curve).</s><s>This was not true for the nonrecurrent network (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>, yellow curve).</s><s>Hence, structured spontaneous activity both lengthens the time scale over which a network can retain its learned connectivity and provides an errorcorrecting mechanism given disruptions of this connectivity.</s></p><p><s>We note that this error-correcting mechanism provides a novel means by which a plastic network may maintain its learned architecture.</s><s>Mechanisms that improve the stability of single synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> may complement structured spontaneous activity in improving stability.</s><s>However, such mechanisms, on their own, will not demonstrate recovery after a perturbation (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>).</s><s>This is because coordinated activation of entire assemblies during structured spontaneous activity is necessary for this recovery to occur.</s></p><p><s>To verify that W in reached a steady state, we increased the speed of plasticity and simulated the network for 4,000 s.</s><s>Indeed, most assemblies maintained potentiated values (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>To verify that the rate of change of individual synaptic weights decreased during spontaneous activity as the network remained near a stable equilibrium, we plotted the summed instantaneous rate of change of weights across the network (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>This quantity substantially decreased after training was complete, suggesting that the fluctuations in the connectivity matrix were indeed small.</s><s>Finally, we also verified that our results were not dependent on the simulation time step 41 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>While we have focused mainly on the voltage-based excitatory STDP rule for clarity of exposition, we also tested our results using two other realistic plasticity rules: the triplet rule of Pfister and Gerstner <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and the calcium-based rule of Graupner and Brunel <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>All three rules exhibited a firing rate dependence of potentiation and depression, with high postsynaptic rates leading to strong potentiation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>).</s><s>However, the calcium-based rule led to synaptic potentiation at sufficiently high presynaptic rates, even with low postsynaptic rates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">right</ref>).</s><s>This implies that activation of assembly j will lead to potentiation of synapses from j to i in the absence of activation of i.</s><s>This could potentially lead to interference between activated assemblies during the training protocol.</s><s>Indeed, after training, the triplet and voltage-based rules behaved similarly, with spontaneous activity improving the stability of W in for most but not all assemblies, while the calcium-based rule behaved differently (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>).</s><s>For the calciumbased rule, W in increased for certain assemblies after training, suggesting that training was unable to fully potentiate synapses within assemblies.</s><s>Furthermore, the calcium-based rule led to winner-take-all behaviour, with only certain assemblies remaining potentiated after training (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, right).</s><s>These results suggest that structured spontaneous activity improves stability for a variety of plasticity rules, but the details depend on the specific instantiation of the STDP rule.</s><s>In particular, rules that potentiate when the presynaptic, but not postsynaptic, neuron fires at a high rate are likely to exhibit interference between assemblies during training.</s><s>Remapping architecture with novel stimuli.</s><s>We have shown that a set of stimulus patterns can be embedded in a recurrent network with STDP.</s><s>How flexible is this network architecture?</s><s>Can assemblies associated with novel stimulus sets be embedded in the network?</s><s>We examined this question by defining a new set of 20 stimulus patterns and repeatedly presenting them to the network.</s><s>We then compared W in for the new stimulusdefined assemblies and the old assemblies throughout this protocol.</s></p><p><s>During this retraining protocol, W in increased for the new assemblies and decayed for the old assemblies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref>).</s><s>Fully potentiating the new set of assemblies required more stimulus presentations than the original training protocol, indicating that previously trained stimulus-specific assemblies can interfere with the formation of new ones.</s><s>Retraining also shifted spontaneous activity.</s><s>Prior to retraining, the original assemblies were activated during spontaneous activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>).</s><s>Afterwards, the new assemblies were activated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6c</ref>).</s><s>Given the stability of the trained assemblies (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and these results, we conclude that the network architecture is stable to weak perturbations of its input statistics, but sufficiently strong changes in its inputs cause the network to reorganize itself.</s></p><p><s>Mechanisms of stability and remapping in a reduced model.</s><s>The high dimensional and complex dynamics of our spiking network precluded a mathematically rigorous analysis of the dynamics of neuronal assemblies.</s><s>In particular, it was not possible to formally reduce the dynamics of synaptic weights to a lowdimensional system whose stable states could be identified.</s><s>In this section, we develop a simplified model of interacting neuronal populations that qualitatively reproduces the dynamics of assembly formation in the spiking network (see Supplementary Methods for a full descriptioin of the reduced model).</s><s>We explore this model and show three core requirements for stable assembly structure: a firing rate-dependent plasticity rule, multistability in the firing rates of different assemblies and homeostasis.</s></p><p><s>We considered two populations whose firing rates reflect the number of active neurons in the population at a given time (see Methods).</s><s>Populations interacted according to a 2 Â 2 excitatory synaptic weight matrix, as well as via global inhibition that was proportional to the total excitatory activity.</s><s>We implemented a plasticity rule with a firing rate dependence similar to that of the spiking network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, bottom; see Methods).</s><s>The change in the synaptic strength from population j to i was given by DW ij pr j Á r i (r i À y), where r i is the firing rate of population i and y is the threshold for potentiation.</s><s>Strong potentiation therefore only occurred when both the postsynaptic and presynaptic firing rates, r i and r j , were large.</s></p><p><s>When all synaptic weights were equal, both populations exhibited low levels of activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>, left).</s><s>However, when recurrent excitation within populations 1 and 2 was strong (W 11 ¼ W 22 ¼ w max ), the populations exhibited multistability and transitioned between low and high activity states, similar to the trained spiking network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>, right).</s><s>These different dynamics led to differential recruitment of plasticity.</s><s>In particular, little plasticity was recruited when both populations had low rates, but the within-population weight W ii was strongly potentiated whenever population i was in a high activity state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">bottom</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Similar to the spiking model, we assumed that each row of the 2 Â 2 matrix defining the weights for the two populations summed to a constant (homeostatic synaptic normalization;</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W 11 þ W 12 ¼ W 22 þ W 21 ¼ w max )</formula><p><s>. This led to competition between the synapses onto each population.</s><s>This feature allowed us to reduce the four-dimensional dynamics of the weights to a two-dimensional plane of W 11 and W 22 , the strength of the synaptic weight within each of the two populations.</s><s>Further, since synaptic plasticity occurred on a time scale that is much slower than the stochastic activity of the population dynamics, we applied standard mathematical techniques from dynamical systems theory to derive the phase portrait for the synaptic weights (Supplementary Methods).</s><s>Specifically, to determine the stability of any fixed points of W ij , we computed the vector field dW 11 /dt and dW 22 /dt for each location in the W 11 and W 22 planes (black arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7d</ref>).</s><s>When both W ii were not potentiated, the network had only one stable activity level, and W ii did not change substantially (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>, left and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7b</ref>, bottom left).</s><s>But when the W ii were sufficiently large, the system exhibited structured spontaneous activity and activation of populations drove the W ii to w max , their fully potentiated value (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>, right and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7b</ref>, top right).</s><s>Thus, the model illustrated that when W ii is potentiated, structured spontaneous activity appears and causes W ii to approach w max .</s><s>This dynamic makes the assembly structure (W 11 ¼ W 22 ¼ w max ) stable to small fluctuations in W ij .</s></p><p><s>Next, we extended the model to study the effects of remapping.</s><s>We defined a four-population model in which each population was half the size of the two-population case, so that pairs of populations could together form assemblies with identical dynamics to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>.</s><s>When populations 1 and 3 were strongly connected and populations 2 and 4 were strongly connected, each pair (1,3) and (2,4) formed an assembly that underwent correlated fluctuations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7c</ref>, left).</s><s>Further, if the connectivity was changed such that the pairs (1,2) and (3,4) were strongly connected, the new pairs underwent correlated fluctuations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7c,</ref><ref type="figure">right</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We examined the dynamics of the synaptic weights in the subspace spanned by W 12 and W 34 (see Methods).</s><s>We found that both the (1,3) and (2,4) pairing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7c</ref>, left and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7d</ref>, bottom left) and the

reduction in Fano factor as is frequently observed in cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>).</s><s>This reduction was due to the suppression of spontaneous

receiver-operating characteristic curve was higher after training (Fig. <ref type="figure">8d</ref>).</s><s>Hence, training led to a measurable improvement in stimulus encoding, even at the single-neuron level.</s></p><p><s>We also quantified collective activity using the spike count correlation between neuron pairs measured in 100-ms windows across trials.</s><s>On average, correlations during spontaneous activity were near zero consistent with a balanced asynchronous state <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>).</s><s>However, neuron pairs in the
