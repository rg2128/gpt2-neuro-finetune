eigenvalue-based methods may be misleading.</s><s>We introduce a novel approach to matrix analysis, called clique topology, that extracts features of the data invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations.</s><s>These features can be used to detect both random and geometric structure, and depend only on the relative ordering of matrix entries.</s><s>We then analyzed the activity of pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus, recorded while the animal was exploring a 2D environment, and confirmed that our method is able to detect geometric organization using only the intrinsic pattern of neural correlations.</s><s>Remarkably, we found similar results during nonspatial behaviors such as wheel running and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.</s><s>This suggests that the geometric structure of correlations is shaped by the underlying hippocampal circuits and is not merely a consequence of position coding.</s><s>We propose that clique topology is a powerful new tool for matrix analysis in biological settings, where the relationship of observed quantities to more meaningful variables is often nonlinear and unknown.</s><s>N eural activity and connectivity data are often presented in the form of a matrix whose entries, C ij , indicate the strength of correlation or connectivity between pairs of neurons, cell types, or imaging voxels.</s><s>Detecting structure in such a matrix is a critical step toward understanding the organization and function of the underlying neural circuits.</s><s>In this work, we focus on neural activity, whose structure may reflect the coding properties of neurons, rather than their physical locations within the brain.</s><s>For example, place cells in rodent hippocampus act as position sensors, exhibiting a high firing rate when the animal's position lies inside the neuron's "place field," its preferred region of the spatial environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Without knowledge of the coding properties, however, it is unclear whether such a geometric organization could be detected purely from the pattern of neural correlations.</s><s>Alternatively, a correlation or connectivity matrix could be truly unstructured, such as the connectivity pattern observed in the fly olfactory system (2), indicating random network organization.</s></p><p><s>Can we distinguish these possibilities, using only the intrinsic features of the matrix C ij ?</s><s>The most common approach is to use standard tools from matrix analysis that rely on quantities, such as eigenvalues, that are invariant under linear change of basis.</s><s>This strategy is natural in physics, where meaningful quantities should be preserved by linear coordinate transformations.</s><s>In contrast, measurements in biological settings are often obtained as nonlinear transformations of the underlying "real" variables, whereas the choice of basis is meaningful and fixed.</s><s>For example, basis elements might represent particular neurons or genes, and measurements (matrix elements) could consist of pairwise correlations in neural activity, or the coexpression of pairs of genes.</s><s>Instead of change of basis, the relevant structure in these data should be invariant under matrix transformations of the following form:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C ij = f À A ij Á , [<label>1</label></formula><formula

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The only feature of a matrix that is preserved under the transformations (Eq.</s><s>1), for monotonically increasing f, is the relative ordering of its entries, as C ij &lt; C kℓ whenever A ij &lt; A kℓ (SI Appendix, Supplementary Text).</s><s>We refer to this combinatorial information as the "order complex," ordðCÞ.</s><s>It is convenient to represent the order complex as a nested sequence of graphs, where each subsequent graph includes an additional edge ðijÞ corresponding to the next-largest matrix entry C ij (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>).</s><s>Any quantity computed from the order complex is automatically invariant under the transformations (Eq.</s><s>1), because ordðAÞ = ordðCÞ.</s><s>We found that the arrangement of "cliques" (all-to-all connected subgraphs) in the order complex of a matrix can be used in lieu of eigenvalues to detect random or geometric structure.</s></p><p><s>"Clique topology" provides a systematic measure of how cliques fit together and overlap across the entire order complex.</s><s>The topological structure of cliques in a graph can be quantified by first "filling in" all cliques, and then counting noncontractible cycles, i.e., arrangements of cliques which bound "holes."</s><s>Minimal examples of 1-, 2-, and 3-cycles are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C (Inset)</ref>.</s><s>A 1-cycle bounds a 2D area, a 2-cycle bounds a 3D volume, and a 3-cycle bounds a 4D region (SI Appendix, Supplementary Text).</s><s>As the edge density ρ increases, new cycles are created, modified, and eventually destroyed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>).</s><s>One can track these changes by computing a set of Betti numbers (6, 7), β m , which count the independent mcycles in each graph after all cliques have been filled in.</s><s>The Betti numbers across all graphs in an order complex yield "Betti curves," β m ðρÞ (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, Supplementary Text).</s></p><p><s>Detection of Random Organization.</s><s>Although the details of individual graphs in the order complex may be sensitive to noise in the matrix entries, we found that clique topology provides robust signatures that can be used to distinguish structure from randomness.</s><s>In the case of a random symmetric matrix with i.i.d.</s><s>entries, the corresponding order complex is a sequence of Erd} os-Rényi random graphs.</s><s>We found that the Betti curves β m ðρÞ are remarkably reliable for such matrices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref>), and display a characteristic unimodal shape with peak values that increase with m (m N).</s><s>This reliability has been theoretically predicted <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref> and makes it possible to robustly distinguish random from nonrandom structure in the presence of a monotone nonlinearity (Eq.</s><s>1).</s><s>Unsurprisingly, correlation matrices obtained from finite samples of N independent random variables display the same characteristic Betti curves as random symmetric N × N matrices (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>Note that computing low-dimensional ðm ≤ 3Þ Betti curves for matrices of size N ∼ 100 is numerically tractable due to recent advances in computational topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Detection of Geometric Organization.</s><s>If a correlation or connectivity matrix is not random, what kind of structure can one detect?</s><s>Uncovering "geometric" structure is especially important in neuroscience, because it indicates that neurons encode geometrically organized stimuli.</s><s>For example, orientation-tuned neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and hippocampal place cells (1) have correlations that decrease with distance between represented angles or locations in the environment, respectively.</s><s>This is easy to see by correlating neural responses directly to the relevant stimuli.</s><s>However, it is unclear whether it is even possible to detect such an organization from pairwise correlations among neurons alone-without a priori knowledge of the represented stimulus space.</s><s>A further difficulty is to detect geometric organization that is invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations of the matrix entries.</s></p><p><s>To our surprise, we found that the ordering of matrix entries encodes geometric features, such as dimension (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>).</s><s>For larger matrices, the precise dimension may be difficult to discern in the presence of noise.</s><s>Nevertheless, the organization of cliques in the order complex carries signatures of an underlying Euclidean geometry, irrespective of dimension.</s><s>For example, the triangle inequality, kxzk ≤ kxyk + kyzk, implies that if two edges of a triangle are present in the order complex at some edge density ρ, there is a higher probability of the third edge also being present.</s><s>Intuitively, this means that cliques in the order complex will be more prominent for geometric compared with random matrices, and cycles will be comparatively short-lived, as cliques cause holes to be more readily filled in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C ij = f ðA ij Þ, for f ðxÞ = 1 -e -30x</formula><p><s>. Red curves show Wigner's semicircle distribution with matching mean and variance.</s><s>(C, Top) The order complex of A is represented as a sequence of binary adjacency matrices, indexed by the density ρ of nonzero entries.</s><s>(Bottom) Graphs corresponding to the adjacency matrices.</s><s>Minimal examples of a 1-cycle (yellow square), a 2-cycle (red octahedron), and a 3-cycle (blue orthoplex) appear at ρ = 0.1, 0.25, and 0.45, respectively.</s><s>(D) At edge density ρ 0 , there are no cycles.</s><s>Cliques of size 3 and 4 are depicted with light and dark gray shading.</s><s>As the edge density increases, a new 1-cycle (yellow) is created, persists, and is eventually destroyed at densities ρ 1 , ρ 2 , and ρ 3 , respectively.</s><s>(E) For a distribution of 1,000 random N × N symmetric matrices (N = 88), average Betti curves β 1 ðρÞ, β 2 ðρÞ, and β 3 ðρÞ are shown (yellow, red, and blue dashed curves), together with 95% confidence intervals (shaded areas).</s></p><p><s>To see whether clique topology can provide reliable signatures of geometric organization, we computed Betti curves for distributions of geometric matrices (N = 88), generated from random points uniformly sampled from unit cubes of dimensions d = 5,10,16,24, and 88, and having entries that decrease with distance (Materials and Methods).</s><s>We then computed average Betti curves β 1 ðρÞ, β 2 ðρÞ, and β 3 ðρÞ for each d, and found that they are stratified by dimension but retain characteristic features that are independent of dimension.</s><s>In particular, the peak values of geometric Betti curves are considerably smaller than those of random symmetric matrices with matching parameters (p &lt; 0.001), and decrease with increasing m (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>).</s><s>This pattern remains over the full range of tested dimensions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B,</ref><ref type="figure">Inset</ref>).</s><s>We conclude that Betti curves can, in principle, be used to distinguish geometric from random structure.</s></p><p><s>Signatures of Intrinsic Geometric Structure in Neural Activity.</s><s>Can clique topology be used to detect geometric organization from pairwise correlations in noisy neural data?</s><s>To answer this question, we examined correlations of hippocampal place cells in rodents during spatial navigation in a 2D open field environment.</s><s>In this context, geometric structure is expected due to the existence of spatially localized receptive fields [place fields (1)] but has not previously been detected intrinsically using only the pattern of correlations.</s></p><p><s>We computed correlations from spike trains of simultaneously recorded neurons in area CA1 of dorsal hippocampus (Materials and Methods).</s><s>Each pairwise correlation, C ij , was obtained from the mean of a cross-correlogram on a timescale of τ max = 1 s (SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>).</s><s>The resulting matrix was then analyzed using clique topology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>).</s><s>As expected, the Betti curves from place cell data were in close agreement to those of geometric matrices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref>, Top), up to a small rightward shift that is likely due to noise (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Although we found that qualitative geometric structure is robustly detectable, the precise dimension is sensitive to noise and currently difficult to estimate, even for low dimensions.</s><s>For example, a geometric matrix in dimension d = 2 exhibits higher-dimensional nonzero Betti curves if a fraction of the neurons have nongeometric correlations with the rest (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4B</ref>).</s><s>A post hoc analysis of the recorded place cells showed that 5-10% exhibited nonconvex place fields; this alone could account for the higher dimensions we observed.</s><s>On the other hand, Betti curves of d = 2 geometric matrices with up to 10% of the neurons having random correlations still lie in the d ≤ N geometric regime (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next compared the data Betti curves to shuffled controls, obtained by randomly permuting the matrix entries (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S5 A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Shuffling completely destroys any structure in the order complex, yielding distributions of Betti curves identical to those of random matrices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref>).</s><s>We found that the Betti curves from place cell data were an order of magnitude smaller than the mean Betti curves of the shuffled matrices, and well outside the 95% confidence intervals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref>, Bottom).</s><s>To quantify the significance of nonrandom structure, we used integrated Betti values as follows:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">β m = Z 1 0 β m ðρÞdρ,</formula><p><s>and verified that they were significantly smaller than those obtained from 1,000 trials of the shuffled controls (P &lt; 0.001), but well within the confidence intervals for geometric controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To test whether the observed geometric organization was consistent across animals and recording sessions, we repeated these analyses for eight additional datasets from three different animals during spatial navigation (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>All but one of the nine datasets were consistent with the corresponding geometric controls, suggesting that geometric structure of correlations is a robust phenomenon during spatial navigation.</s><s>We also repeated the analyses for different choices of the correlation timescale, τ max , ranging from 10 ms to 2 s, and observed similar results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3D</ref>).</s><s>As a further test of geometric organization, we computed the distribution of "persistence lifetimes" from the order complex of the open field correlation matrix (SI Appendix, Supplementary Text).</s><s>The lifetime measures how long a hole persists as it evolves from one graph to the next in the order complex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>).</s><s>Again, the data exhibited topological signatures that were far from random, but consistent with geometric organization (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To ensure that the observed correlation structure could not be explained by the differences in interactions of individual neurons with the "mean field" activity of the network, we performed an additional random control that preserves row and column sums of pairwise correlation matrices.</s><s>Specifically, we computed Betti curves for matrices drawn from a weighted maximum entropy (WME) distribution, subject to the constraint that expected row sums match the original pairwise correlation matrix (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref> C and D).</s><s>The Betti curves and persistence lifetimes of the WME controls were similar to those of random symmetric matrices (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>), showing that the nonrandom structure in the data does not arise from the fact that some neurons have higher levels of correlation with the population as a whole.</s></p><p><s>Scrambled Place Fields Yield Nongeometric Correlations.</s><s>Are the spatial coding properties of place cells sufficient to account for the observed geometric organization of correlations during spatial navigation?</s><s>Or, alternatively, does this structure reflect finer features of the correlations, beyond what is expected from place fields alone?</s><s>To address this question, we computed place fields F i ðxÞ for each place cell from the same data used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>, together with the animal's 2D spatial trajectory xðtÞ (SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods).</s><s>We then generated synthetic spike trains for each neuron as inhomogeneous Poisson processes, with rate functions r i ðtÞ given by the simple place field model as follows:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_4">r i ðtÞ = F i ðxðtÞÞ, [<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">]</formula><p><s>where xðtÞ is the animal's actual trajectory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3E</ref>).</s><s>By design, the synthetic spike trains preserved the influence of place fields, but discarded all other features of the data, including precise spike timing and any nonspatial correlates.</s><s>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Betti curves derived from the place field model reproduced all of the signatures of geometric organization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3E</ref> and SI Appendix, We next asked whether the geometry of place fields was necessary, or whether the Betti curves during spatial navigation could be attributed to an even more basic feature of the data, which is that each neuron is driven by the same global signal, xðtÞ, filtered by a cell-specific function F i ðxÞ.</s><s>To answer this question, we scrambled each place field by permuting the values of F i ðxÞ inside "pixels" of a 100 × 100 grid, creating nongeometric receptive fields Fi ðxÞ (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S9D</ref>;
