<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A novel cell type in Barrington's nucleus with a role in urination</head><p><s>Our initial tests and a previous study of Bar <ref type="bibr">CRH</ref> neural function showed modest effects on urination in awake animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , suggesting that they are unlikely to facilitate voluntary urination.</s><s>Approximately half of the Bar neurons projecting to the spinal cord lack CRH expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , and their molecular identity and function is undetermined <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>We took a candidate approach to identify molecular markers for Bar neurons that may function to promote urinary sphincter relaxation, and focused on estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1, ERα), as it is expressed in a subset of Bar cells in both mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>It is unknown if ESR1 marks a cell type distinct from Bar CRH .</s><s>Immunostaining for ESR1 protein in CRH-Cre x ROSA-LSL-tdTomato (CRH-tdT) individuals confirmed a small Bar subpopulation (~200 cells) expressing high amounts of ESR1 (Bar ESR1 neurons, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-f</ref>).</s><s>The majority of Bar ESR1 neurons (~3/4 of the Bar ESR1 population, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>) do not overlap with CRH-tdT, and the overlapping minority likely represents an upper bound on co-expression since tdT integrates Crh promoter activity over the lifetime of the animal.</s><s>Bar ESR1 neurons are found in a dorsal cluster within the Nissl-defined ovoid Bar nucleus, whereas Bar CRH neurons are more numerous (~500 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> ), ventrally biased, and extend further along the rostrocaudal axis beyond traditional, Nissl-defined Bar borders (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d-e</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, in ESR1-Cre mice, 96.8 % of Bar ESR1 neurons (n=3 mice) overlap with reporter expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), confirming that the Crh and Esr1 promoters are active in largely independent Bar populations.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the potential for Bar ESR1 neurons to relax the urethral sphincter, we evaluated their neurotransmitter identity and anatomical connections to the lower urinary tract.</s><s>Immunostaining for αESR1 in Vgat-Cre and Vglut2-Cre mouse lines crossed to fluorescent reporters, as well as in-situ hybridization, revealed that the majority of Bar ESR1 neurons express Vglut2 (93.6 % reporter overlap, n=3 mice) and not Vgat (2.2 % reporter overlap, n=4 mice; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-k</ref>).</s><s>Injection of the retrograde tracer CTB into the lumbosacral spinal cord resulted in co-expression with Bar ESR1 cells, indicating their direct projections to urinary targets (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1l-n</ref>).</s><s>To further investigate Bar ESR1 axonal projections, we unilaterally injected AAV expressing Cre-dependent GFP into the Bar of ESR1-Cre or CRH-Cre animals, and imaged the lower thoracic to sacral spinal cord (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">h,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>The lumbosacral mediolateral column (ML) contains preganglionic autonomic neurons that excite the bladder (along with intermingled interneurons) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , and the lumbosacral dorsal grey commissure (DGC) contains interneurons that directly inhibit (relax) sphincter motorneurons of the dorsolateral nucleus via Bar input <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1k</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the known role in bladder pressure regulation, Bar CRH-GFP axons showed a dense focal projection to the ML (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>-h top row, l) with only sparse fibers arching further medially or to thoracolumbar levels T13-L2 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-b</ref>).</s><s>Bar ESR1-GFP axons projected similarly across the lumbosacral ML, with additional lighter fibers seen in the thoracolumbar ML (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>However, they also provided much denser innervation of the sphincter-inhibiting DGC, extending rostrally from the proposed L3-L4 burst generator <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> to mid-sacral levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>-h bottom row, l; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Bilateral labeling of Bar ESR1 or Bar CRH neurons with a second Cre-dependent virus (AAV-FLEX-ChR2) confirmed the same projection patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b-c</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the cell body distribution, molecular expression, and efferents of Bar ESR1 neurons indicate that they constitute an uncharacterized cell type within Bar <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , distinct from Bar CRH neurons.</s></p><p><s>Upon detecting the odor of a female, male mice promptly urinate to show their command of the territory and advertise their availability to mate <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>We promote this voluntary urination by adding female odor (female urine) to an arena lined with absorbent paper and record the male's position from above and their urine output from below.</s><s>This enables quantification of both the timing and abundance of voluntary urination events during freely moving behavior (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>To determine the temporal activation of Bar ESR1 cells in relationship to this natural urination behavior, we unilaterally injected Bar with AAV-FLEX-GCaMP6s in ESR1-Cre animals and imaged population calcium activity with fiber photometry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-b</ref>).</s><s>We observed robust, discrete increases in fluorescence that were highly correlated with detected urination events, compared to randomly chosen intervals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c-e</ref>).</s><s>The lags for maximal cross correlation between urine detection and GCaMP fluorescence transients revealed no significant difference between the timing of Bar ESR1 population activity and urine marks (GCaMP precedes by 0.37 ± 0.16 seconds, mean ± s.e.m., n=76 urination events across 7 mice, p = 0.18, Wilcoxon signed rank test).</s><s>Altogether, we find that ESR1 defines a novel cell type in Bar with anatomical and physiological features consistent with a direct role in urination.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Artificial activation of Bar ESR1 neurons promotes urination in awake and anesthetized animals</head><p><s>Bar CRH-ChR2 photostimulation was previously shown to drive bladder pressure increases during urethane-anesthetized cystometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , but the sufficiency of these cells in awake urination has not been characterized.</s><s>To determine if either of these distinct Bar populations promote urination in behaving animals, we first bilaterally infected Bar ESR1 or Bar CRH neurons with AAV-FLEX-ChR2 or -GFP (Bar ESR1-ChR2 , Bar ESR1-GFP , or Bar CRH-ChR2 , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref>) and performed slice recordings to confirm that both Bar ESR1-ChR2 and Bar CRH-ChR2 neurons reliably responded to photostimulation at frequencies previously used in electrical stimulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>We then quantified and compared the latency and amount of urine induced by photostimulation in awake, freely-moving individuals without urine-promoting odor cues.</s><s>While photostimulation of GFP-infected individuals produced no effect on urine excretion, Bar ESR1-ChR2 stimulation led to robust, frequency-dependent urine volume released, following light onset with a mean latency of 2.1 seconds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d-h</ref>; Suppl.</s><s>Video 1).</s><s>Over 96% of Bar ESR1-ChR2 stimulation trials at 10-50 Hz resulted in urination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>In comparison, photostimulation of Bar CRH-ChR2 neurons during freely-moving behavior had a much smaller effect on urination despite generally higher ChR2 viral infection levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c-h</ref>; Suppl.</s><s>Video 2).</s><s>Less than 37% of Bar CRH-ChR2 stimulation trials at 10-50 Hz resulted in the voiding of urine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</s><s>Of this subset, the latency and amount of urine produced differed from Bar ESR1-ChR2 at all frequencies tested (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d-h</ref>).</s><s>We additionally investigated the extent to which Bar ESR1 and Bar CRH neural activity could initiate voiding without conscious sensory input.</s><s>Photostimulation under isoflurane anesthesia, known to depress reflex urination <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , resulted in urine voiding in 43% of the Bar ESR1-ChR2 trials, but only 6% of the Bar CRH-ChR2 trials, with none of the Bar CRH-ChR2 voids occurring during the photostimulus window (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>, i; Suppl.</s><s>Video 3).</s><s>This indicates that Bar ESR1 neuronal activity induces rapid and efficient urination and hints at a distinct mechanism from neighboring Bar CRH activity that is known to increase bladder pressure.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bar ESR1 neurons drive urination by controlling the urethral sphincter</head><p><s>To directly test the effect of Bar ESR1 and Bar CRH neurons on urinary muscle targets, we performed external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) and cystometry (bladder filling and pressure recording) under isoflurane anesthesia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>We perfused saline at a constant rate into the bladder to stimulate reflex voiding and observed natural cycles of bladder pressure increase and associated EUS bursting muscle patterns, which correlated with voiding and subsequent bladder pressure decrease (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>In rodents, these bursting contractions interspersed with periods of muscle relaxation are believed to enable efficient urine flow through the narrow rodent urethra <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Following observation of regular cystometry cycles, we stopped the saline pump when the bladder was "filled" or "empty" (75% or 10% of the volume observed to trigger reflex urination, respectively) and initiated 5 seconds of photostimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>, blue arrows).</s><s>We found that both Bar ESR1-ChR2 and Bar CRH-ChR2 photostimulation produced reliable, time-locked bladder pressure increases at similar latencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c-d</ref>).</s><s>The initial latency and slope of the bladder pressure increase by stimulation of each cell type was indistinguishable by our analysis; however, the peak pressure and end pressure (25 seconds after stimulus onset) were significantly less for Bar ESR1-ChR2 photostimulation.</s><s>This difference occurs because only with the Bar ESR1-ChR2 photostimulation did we observe abundant urine release, which results in a sharp pressure decrease below the starting value (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c-f</ref>;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Bar is well established to be the key conserved brainstem node that coordinates the switch from urine storage to elimination.</s><s>It is currently modeled as a single projection to the spinal cord that diverges to coordinate both the smooth, involuntary, slow muscle of the bladder wall and the voluntary, striated, fast muscle of the external urethral sphincter (EUS).</s><s>However, neurons that relax the EUS have not previously been identified, at least in part because voluntary urination is difficult to trigger and study in model organisms.</s><s>Here we leveraged the natural behavior of male mice, which are highly motivated to scent mark their territory in environments likely to contain females, irrespective of bladder pressure.</s><s>Our quantitative behavioral assay allowed us to identify and study a novel subpopulation of Bar neurons that are critical to achieve voluntary urination.</s><s>We further show that optogenetic stimulation of these Bar ESR1 neurons in male mice under isoflurane anesthesia can be used as a powerful model of controlled urination.</s><s>The surprising ability of this minority subset of Bar neurons to drive robust urination comes not from the induced bladder pressure increase, but their unique ability to relax the EUS and gate urine release.</s><s>It will be of great interest to determine if the function of the Bar ESR1 neurons is conserved across evolution since ESR1 expression has also been described in Bar of primates, and human urination similarly depends upon relaxing the urethral sphincter <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Our findings in mice suggest an updated model of supraspinal urinary control in which Bar sends molecularly and functionally distinct parallel projections to downstream urinary targets (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>), with Bar ESR1 neurons serving as a key novel subset to enable the study of neural mechanisms underlying voluntary urination.</s></p><p><s>The majority of neurons in Bar express CRH, yet their anatomy and optogenetic activation indicates a role in focal bladder contraction without relaxing the urethral sphincter.</s><s>Moreover, chemogenetic inhibition of Bar CRH neurons does not reveal an essential role for this subset of neurons in generating odor-evoked voluntary urination.</s><s>However, Bar CRH cells have been reported to play a role in urination patterns regulated by long-term social status changes, while CRH itself has a negative effect on urination at longer timescales <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>In agreement with these findings, we replicated an earlier finding that inhibition of Bar CRH neurons leads to a modest decrease in urine marks over a much longer two hour assay (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, Bar CRH neurons have been proposed to map onto the "direct" subset of Bar neurons whose firing rates correlate directly with reflexive bladder contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , and which some have suggested function to prolong the contraction and maintain appropriate pressure rather than initiate urination <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>The activity of about onefourth of Bar neurons does not correlate with reflexive bladder activity at all 14 , and our results suggest that urethral inhibition provides another meaningful dimension to Bar categorization.</s><s>However, a more complete and dynamic catalog of gene expression and spiking activity in Bar neurons during a variety of conditions will likely be needed to fully classify their roles.</s></p><p><s>Liquid waste elimination is a fundamental animal need, but it must compete with many other potential priorities in a complicated world.</s><s>These behavioral interactions could explain the need for heterogeneous urination control at the brainstem level, as demonstrated by the actions of Bar ESR1 and Bar CRH neurons described here.</s><s>For example, scent marking to conspecific odor cues is highly sexually dimorphic, but all adult mice additionally urinate under extreme stress 2 , analogous to stress incontinence in humans.</s><s>Mice will also mark more in novel environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , and it is well known that urination is modulated by circadian rhythms and fluid homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> .</s><s>Finally, control of urination is under complex developmental regulation in rodents, whereby maternal anogenital licking is required in early postnatal life to induce reflex urination and defecation, but this response is later replaced by supraspinal reflexes and even later by voluntary control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>All of these complications are likely to manifest at one or more levels of the brain, and the separability of Bar subtypes could serve to decouple the actions of bladder and urethra to enable more options for complex control of urination behavior relative to brain state and environment.</s></p><p><s>Beyond urination, Bar is also implicated in a wider range of pelvic functions (implying that the term "pontine micturition center" is a misnomer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> ) and has recently been termed the 'pelvic organ stimulating center' by anatomical and correlational evidence for roles in behaviors such as defecation, sexual behavior, and childbirth, which require varying levels of somatic (e.g.</s><s>Bar ESR1 ) and autonomic (e.g.</s><s>Bar CRH ) coordination of the pelvic floor <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>).</s><s>This multifunctional view of Bar perhaps provides the most parsimonious explanation for molecular, cellular, and physiological heterogeneity in this relatively small nucleus.</s><s>For example, ejaculation requires striated urethral muscles for semen expulsion, but simultaneous bladder inhibition and backflow prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , and likely uses the same pattern generator in the L3-L4 DGC proposed to drive bursting urination in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>The current data shows that Bar ESR1 neurons provide input to the DGC at these rostral lumbar levels (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) that could drive the expulsion phase of ejaculation, whilst bladder pressure could be independently inhibited.</s><s>Furthermore, the idea of regulation at different timescales could extend to other pelvic autonomic functions such as pheromone release from the preputial gland, which is also known to be regulated by social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and needs to be synchronized with the urine stream.</s><s>Other slow functions attributed to the pelvic ganglia, but for which little is known in the central nervous system <ref

target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>Thus, while the role of Bar ESR1 neurons in voluntary urination is clear, our demonstration of functional heterogeneity across Bar invites further study into potential roles for all its neurons in regulating various other pelvic functions.</s></p><p><s>Incontinence directly or indirectly affects nearly everyone at some point in their life, yet we still have relatively little understanding of how the brain functions or fails to function during this process.</s><s>Common disruptions include detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in paraplegics or after spinal cord injury 1 , pudendal nerve damage during childbirth, stress urinary incontinence, Fowler's syndrome (inability to voluntarily relax the EUS in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> ), paruresis (inability to urinate in public), and nocturnal enuresis or bedwetting.</s><s>Bar ESR1 neurons can now serve as an important new target for greater understanding of cause and effect in these disorders.</s><s>Furthermore, the ability to direct voluntary urination in behaving male mice on a timescale of seconds also opens up new avenues to record and manipulate neural activity during natural urination that is not driven by bladder distension.</s><s>Bar ESR1 neurons form a critical node in this relatively simple and robust social behavior that can be leveraged to rigorously ask how such behavior is modulated by age, sex, state, and learning.</s></p></div>
