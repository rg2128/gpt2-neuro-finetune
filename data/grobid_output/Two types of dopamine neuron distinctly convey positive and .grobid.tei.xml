Note that this classification was different from that based on the response to 100% airpuff CS.</s><s>In the following, we will focus on the AUS-inhibited and AUS-excited type neurons (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref> for AUS-nonresponsive type, see also Supplementary note C and Supplementary table 4 for the electrophysiological properties of each type).</s></p><p><s>The averaged responses to the reward and airpuff are shown for the AUS-inhibited type neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> and<ref

when the reward was completely predictable by following 100% reward CS, and decreased when the reward was partially predictable by following 50% reward CS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> and<ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with the reward prediction error hypothesis that the activity of dopamine neurons represents a difference between the expected and actual values of reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The AUS-inhibited type neurons appeared to encode prediction error even for aversive outcomes, albeit partially, because it was inhibited by an unexpected aversive airpuff (free airpuff) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) and this inhibitory response decreased monotonically as the airpuff was more predictable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>, see Supplementary note D and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref> for individual neurons).</s><s>Interestingly, the excitatory response of the AUS-excited type neurons to the airpuff also decreased as the airpuff was more predictable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref> and<ref type="figure">h</ref>, see Supplementary note D and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref> for individual neurons).</s></p><p><s>The prediction error hypothesis predicts that neurons should respond in opposite directions when an outcome is unexpectedly omitted, compared to when the same outcome is unexpectedly delivered <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>We found that AUS-inhibited type neurons, but not AUS-excited type neurons, tended to show the responses to both reward omission and airpuff omission (Supplementary note E and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The current consensus that dopamine neurons carry reward-related information is thought to be applied to all dopamine neurons located in the midbrain, including both the SNc and the VTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Since we have found different types of dopamine neurons with regard to their responses to aversive events, we now ask whether they were located in different regions in the midbrain.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> shows the recording sites of the 68 dopamine neurons in monkey N in relation to the response to 100% airpuff CS.</s><s>Neurons showing a significant excitation (i.e., ACS-excited type neurons, red circles) tended to be located in the more dorsolateral part, and neurons showing a significant inhibition (i.e., ACS-inhibited type neurons, blue circles) tended to be located in the more ventromedial part.</s><s>To statistically test this trend, we examined the relation between the recording depth and the response to 100% airpuff CS for monkey N (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>) and monkey D (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>As shown by the scatter plots, a significant negative correlation was found for both monkeys (monkey N, r = -0.50,</s><s>P &lt; 0.01; monkey D, r = -0.57,</s><s>P &lt; 0.01).</s><s>This negative correlation confirmed the dorsolateral-ventromedial differentiation of the airpuff-predicting CS evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses among dopamine neurons.</s><s>Similar location differences were found in relation to response to airpuff itself (Supplementary note F and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s></p><p><s>It has generally been assumed that midbrain dopamine neurons form a unified functional group, all representing reward-related signals in a similar manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Our results are roughly consistent with this idea as far as the reward-related signals are concerned.</s><s>However, clear heterogeneity was revealed when we examined their responses to aversive events.</s><s>We found two types of dopamine neurons, one inhibited and the other excited by airpuff or its predictor.</s><s>Clearly, the unified concept of dopamine neurons needs to be changed (see Supplementary note G for the relationship between our findings and previous studies).</s></p><p><s>We propose that there are at least two functional groups of dopamine neurons.</s><s>Dopamine neurons in the first group (airpuff-inhibited type, i.e., ACS-and AUS-inhibited types) would represent motivational value.</s><s>Their responses covaried with prediction errors associated with both reward and airpuff, and therefore would be useful in learning to approach rewards and avoid aversive stimuli.</s><s>The function of the second group (airpuff-excited type, i.e., ACS-and AUS-excited types) is not immediately clear, but we found that their response to the CS was correlated with the latency of the monkey's orienting response (gaze shift) to the CS and that this correlation appeared only after the CS was paired with reward or airpuff (Supplementary note H and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>).</s><s>These results raise the possibility that the CS-evoked responses of the airpuff-excited dopamine neurons reflect the motivational salience of the CS.</s><s>However, this interpretation may not be valid for the US or US omission responses of these neurons.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the two types of dopamine neurons were distributed differently, the airpuffexcited type in the dorsolateral region in the SNc, and the airpuff-inhibited type in the ventromedial region in the SNc as well as the VTA (see Supplementary note I for details).</s><s>In monkeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> as well as rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , dopamine neurons in the dorsolateral SNc project mainly to the dorsal striatum, while those in the ventromedial SNc and VTA project mainly to the ventral striatum.</s><s>The airpuff-inhibited dopamine neurons in the ventromedial region in the SNc and VTA may thus transmit value-related information to the ventral striatum which is known to represent reward values <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand, the airpuff-excited dopamine neurons in the dorsolateral region in the SNc would respond to motivationally salient stimuli, whether they are appetitive or aversive, and send the signal to the dorsal striatum which is related to orienting behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> .</s><s>This may be part of the mechanism with which orienting behavior such as saccadic eye movement is induced by motivationally salient stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The two types of dopamine neurons may receive inputs from different sources.</s><s>The airpuffexcited dopamine neurons may receive inputs from areas such as the basal forebrain in which neurons also show excitatory responses to both appetitive and aversive events <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> (see Supplementary note J for further discussion).</s><s>On the other hand, the airpuff-inhibited dopamine neurons may receive inputs, at least partially, from the lateral habenula.</s><s>Using the same Pavlovian procedure, we have shown that lateral habenula neurons are excited by the airpuffpredicting CS and inhibited by the reward-predicting CS, indicating that they encode motivational value similarly to the airpuff-inhibited dopamine neurons, but in the opposite manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>The value signals in the lateral habenula would then be transmitted to the dopamine neurons by inhibiting them <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and this effect was stronger on dopamine neurons located in the ventromedial SNc or the VTA where the airpuff-inhibited type dominates (Supplementary note K and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We so far have classified dopamine neurons into two types.</s><s>However, the real picture is more complex.</s><s>First, the difference between the two types was gradual, not distinct, so that there was another group of dopamine neurons that did not belong to any of these types (i.e., airpuff-nonresponsive type).</s><s>Second, the classification was different for CSs and USs (Supplementary note L, Supplementary table 1 and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13b</ref>).</s><s>More neurons were excited by the airpuff-predicting CS, whereas more neurons were inhibited by the airpuff itself.</s><s>This might indicate flexible operations of the dopamine system.</s><s>If a salient stimulus (i.e., CS) is presented, it would be beneficial to orient attention to the stimulus and judge if it predicts a rewarding event or an aversive event.</s><s>This is the time when a majority of dopamine neurons are excited, thus promoting the orienting behavior.</s><s>If an aversive event (i.e., US) occurs, it would be crucial to learn to avoid the action that led to the aversive event.</s><s>This is the time when a majority of dopamine neurons are inhibited, thus promoting avoidance learning.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>We analyzed anticipatory licking, anticipatory blinking and neuronal activity during the Pavlovian procedure.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate the frequency and strength of anticipatory licking, the strain gage signal was used.</s><s>We first calculated the velocity of the strain of the spout.</s><s>Then we integrated the absolute velocity during CS presentation for each trial.</s><s>This integrated velocity becomes larger if the monkeys more frequently and strongly lick the spout.</s><s>We defined this value as the magnitude of anticipatory licking in the trial.</s><s>The magnitude was normalized by the following formula, normalized magnitude = (X -Min) / (Max -Min), where X is the magnitude of anticipatory licking in the trial, Max is the maximum magnitude in the recording session, and Min is the minimum magnitude in the recording session.</s></p><p><s>To count the number of anticipatory blinks during CS presentation, the vertical component of the eyelid signal was used.</s><s>We first calculated the downward velocity of eyelid movement.</s><s>We set a threshold and counted how many times the velocity crossed the threshold during CS presentation for each trial.</s><s>This count was defined as the number of anticipatory blinks in the trial.</s></p><p><s>In analyses of neuronal activity, responses to each CS were defined as the discharge rate during 150-325 ms after CS onset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before CS onset.</s><s>Response to reward was defined as the discharge rate during 200-400 ms after reward onset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before reward onset.</s><s>Response to airpuff was defined as the discharge rate during 50-200 ms after airpuff onset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before airpuff onset.</s><s>Response to reward omission was defined as the discharge rate during 200-500 ms after CS offset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before CS offset.</s><s>Response to airpuff omission was defined as the discharge rate during 150-350 ms after CS offset minus the background discharge rate during the 250 ms before CS offset.</s><s>These time windows were determined based on the averaged activity of dopamine neurons.</s><s>Specifically, we set the time windows such that they include major parts of the excitatory and inhibitory responses.</s></p><p><s>Because the 0% reward and 0% airpuff CSs were physically identical, they could only be distinguished by the block context (appetitive block or aversive block).</s><s>Therefore, to analyze responses to 0% reward and 0% airpuff CSs, we excluded all 0% reward and 0% airpuff CSs that were presented before the block context could be known, that is, before the block's first presentation of 100% CS, 50% CS or free outcome.</s></p><p><s>We characterized the electrophysiological properties of recorded neurons by (1) baseline firing rate, (2) irregularity of firing pattern, (3) spike wave form.</s><s>Baseline firing rate is the mean firing rate during the 250ms before the onset of the timing cue.</s><s>To quantify irregularity of firing pattern, we used an irregularity metric introduced by Davies et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> which they called "IR".</s><s>First, interspike interval (ISI) was computed for each "between-spikes."</s><s>If spike i-1 , spike i , and spike i+1 occurred in this order, the duration between spike i-1 and spike i correspond to ISI i ; the duration between spike i and spike i+1 correspond to ISI i+1 .</s><s>Second, the difference between adjacent ISIs was computed as |log(ISI i / ISI i+1 )|.</s><s>The value was then assigned to the timing when the spikei occurred.</s><s>Thus, small IR values indicate regular firing and large IR values indicate irregular firing.</s><s>We then computed a median of all IR values during ITI (during the 1000ms before timing cue onset).</s><s>To quantify spike wave form, we measured the spike duration of 67 dopamine neurons (whose spike wave forms were successfully recorded).</s><s>The typical spike consisted of the following waves: first, sharp negative; second, sharp positive; third, slow negative; fourth, slow positive.</s><s>We measured the spike duration from the peak of the first wave (sharp negative) to the peak of the third wave (slow negative).</s></p></div>
