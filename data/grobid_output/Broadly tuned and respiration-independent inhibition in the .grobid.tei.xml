<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ongoing GC firing characteristics are state-dependent</head><p><s>To measure the state-dependent spiking activity of GCs, we used juxtacellular 'loosepatch' methods to achieve extracellular recordings in anesthetized and awake, head-fixed male mice (see Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Because we were interested in temporal firing patterns with respect to breathing, respiration was also monitored during many experiments (see Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows data from an example recording in an isoflurane anesthetized mouse, and the subsequently recovered dye fill of the recorded GC.</s><s>Of the 80 neurons reported here, 50 were definitively identified as GCs by their small soma size and dendritic morphology.</s><s>The remaining 30 cells were confirmed to be in the granule cell layer but no other morphological data were available.</s><s>Although there are other cell types found in the granule cell layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> , they were very infrequently labeled (2/75 labeled neurons).</s><s>Moreover, the two data sets were statistically indistinguishable with respect to their basic properties (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, we pooled them for all subsequent analyses.</s><s>Qualitatively, GCs recorded under anesthesia exhibited low firing rates, robustly rhythmic ongoing activity and odor responses that consisted of modulation of the amplitude of the rhythmic bursts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, GCs recorded during wakefulness exhibited higher levels of aperiodic firing, and responded to stimuli with a mix of increases and decreases in firing rate with variable onset and offset times (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Mean ongoing firing rates were significantly higher in the awake condition as compared with those seen under anesthesia (awake: 7.41 ± 7.1 spikes/s, n = 58; anesthesia: 1.90 ± 1.9 spikes/s, n = 22; p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>These differences appear to reflect state-dependent properties in the same population of neurons rather than properties of distinct populations of neurons.</s><s>A subset of cells recorded across behavioral state transitions exhibited the same differences between anesthesia and wakefulness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Typically, mice intermittently ran on the freely rotating ball and we measured running velocity during most recording sessions.</s><s>Although neurophysiological changes to sensory gain and stimulus selectivity have been observed during locomotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> , our analysis suggests that the locomotion related firing changes we observed were likely explained by elevated breathing during running (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>During wakefulness GCs exhibit stronger firing rate changes in response to odors</head><p><s>Odor responses in MTs of awake animals are sparser and more selective than those seen under anesthesia.</s><s>One possible mechanism for this change is greater activity in the GC network facilitating more extensive lateral interactions among MTs.</s><s>We tested this possibility by comparing the strength and selectivity of odor responses during anesthesia and wakefulness.</s></p><p><s>Odor responses in awake animals were more robust, broadly tuned and variable in their temporal dynamics than those seen in anesthetized animals.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> shows a typical example response histogram for a GC recorded from an anesthetized mouse.</s><s>Note that tuning curves quantified as mean firing rate changes during (red) and after (green) the stimulus are very flat.</s><s>A bootstrap procedure testing the significance of individual odor responses (see Online Methods) revealed only a few weak responses.</s><s>In contrast, robust firing rate changes were commonly observed in GCs of awake mice during the odor.</s><s>However, qualitative assessment of histograms revealed these robust responses also frequently outlasted the stimulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>GC responses in awake mice commonly consisted of a mixture of some excitatory and some suppressive responses to different odors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>The sign and magnitude of responses during and after the odor were typically not mutually predictive.</s><s>For awake-state GCs, rank correlation values between tuning curves computed from activity during the stimulus and tuning curves computed from data just after the stimulus were variable but generally low (r = 0.36 ± 0.04, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient).</s><s>For most cells (36/49), there was no significant relationship (p &gt; 0.05).</s></p><p><s>Mean ranked tuning curves collected for a standard set of 10 odorants were steeper for GCs in awake mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) both during the stimulus (anesthesia slope: 0.18 ± 0.1 [spikes/s]/odor, n = 18; awake slope: 0.56 ± 0.3 1 [spikes/s]/odor, n = 27; p &lt; 0.001, U test) and after the stimulus (anesthesia slope: 0.24 ± 0.2 [spikes/s]/odor, n = 18; awake slope: 0.76 ± 0.4 [spikes/s]/odor, n = 27; p &lt; 0.001, U test).</s><s>The increase in the overall slope of the tuning curves resulted nearly equally from increased excitation to some odors and increased firing suppression to others (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Considering all odors presented to all cells, GCs in awake mice responded to a significantly greater fraction of stimuli after odor offset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>) (anesthesia: 6.3 ± 7 %, n = 22; awake variance during: 16.8 ± 18 spikes/s, n = 49; p &lt; 0.05, U test) and tuning curves collected during both analysis epochs had significantly higher variance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>) (anesthesia variance during: 1.42 ± 1.8 spikes/s, n = 22; awake variance during: 12.2 ± 12 spikes/s, n = 49; p &lt; 0.001, U test) (anesthesia variance after: 2.26 ± 2.4 spikes/s, n = 22; awake variance after: 21.1 ± 22 spikes/s, n = 49; p &lt; 0.001, U test).</s><s>This latter analysis does not account for differences in firing statistics between behavioral states.</s><s>Therefore, we further computed a response modulation index (RMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> (also see Online Methods) that normalizes the variability across stimuli to the variability across trials separately for each state.</s><s>Even when correcting for the different levels of noise in this way, the significantly enhanced modulation of firing rate across stimuli in the awake state persisted both during (anesthesia RMI: 0.70 ± 0.4, n = 22; awake RMI: 1.01 ± 0.52, n = 49; p &lt; 0.05, ttest) and after the stimulus (anesthesia RMI: 0.77 ± 0.5, n = 22; awake RMI: 1.13 ± 0.85, n = 49; p &lt; 0.05, ttest).</s><s>These data show that GCs respond more strongly and to a broader range of odors in the awake state as compared to the anesthetized state.</s><s>Even after correcting for different firing statistics, our analysis reveals that GC spiking in response to odors has a greater dynamic range across stimuli.</s><s>These data reveal that GCs exhibit stronger, more broadly-tuned responses in the awake as opposed to the anesthetized state.</s><s>Therefore we conclude that the awake state is characterized by amplified lateral interactions between MTs via GCs.</s><s>Further, our finding that GC responses frequently continue beyond the end of the stimulus raises the possibility that during wakefulness GCs reflect non-sensory events or cortical influence, as opposed to bottomup sensory input.</s></p></div>

awake r: 0.25 ± 0.24, n = 18; p &lt; 0.001, U test).</s></p><p><s>In addition to being strongly coupled to the breathing rhythm, GCs during anesthesia were as a population synchronized to a narrow window of the respiratory phase corresponding to the period just after the peak of inspiration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>, top).</s><s>Interestingly, this synchrony was not evident in the population of GCs recorded during wakefulness.</s><s>Instead, in the awake state GCs displayed divergence in their mean coupling phase angles, covering a much broader range of the respiratory cycle.</s><s>The distributions of mean phase angles were significantly different for awake state GCs and anesthetized state GCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) (p &lt; 0.01, Kolmogorov Smirnov test).</s></p><p><s>Mitral/tufted cells are phase coupled at baseline and frequently shift their coupling phase angle in the presence of an odor stimulus.</s><s>The direction and magnitude of the phase angle shift depends on odor stimulus identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> .</s><s>We therefore assessed whether phase coupling angle in GCs was stimulus-dependent in awake or anesthetized mice.</s><s>We first selected neurons that showed significant respiratory coupling at baseline (16/16 anesthetized state GCs and 16/18 awake state GCs).</s><s>For each baseline coupled cell, we identified all odors for which spiking during the trials of that odor was significantly coupled to respiration.</s><s>This yielded 300 cell-odor pairs (from 15 cells) in anesthetized state GCs and 45 cell-odor pairs (from 10 cells) in awake state GCs.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref> shows data from an example anesthetized state GC and an example awake state GC, comparing the baseline activity phase histogram with the stimulus-specific phase histograms for all odors that evoked significantly phase coupled activity from that cell.</s><s>In each case, the stimulus-specific coupling phases for all odors clustered tightly around the mean baseline coupling phase.</s><s>We quantified this close correspondence between baseline and stimulus-driven coupling by correlating the phase histograms of each cell-odor pair with the baseline phase histogram of its parent cell.</s><s>A large majority of cell-odor pairs showed a significant positive correlation between their stimulus-driven histogram and baseline phase histogram (276/300 cell-odor pairs from anesthetized state GCs and 32/45 cell-odor pairs from awake state GCs), and the mean cell-odor pair correlation for both populations was high (anesthesia corr.</s><s>coeff.</s><s>r: 0.77 ± 0.2; awake corr.</s><s>coeff.</s><s>r: 0.57 ± 0.2).</s></p><p><s>Thus contrary to our prediction, GCs are not strongly coupled to respiration during wakefulness.</s><s>Taken together with our further observation that individual GCs have weak and diverse phase relationships with breathing and that this relationship is insensitive to odors, we conclude it is unlikely that GCs play a dominant role in influencing respiratory locking in MTs during wakefulness.</s><s>Moreover, GCs do not appear to even merely follow the respiratory locking of MTs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Odor responses in GCs are independent of respiration during wakefulness</head><p><s>The analysis we describe above suggests that odor information carried by GCs is independent of the breath cycle during wakefulness.</s><s>If so, that argues against a role for GCs in patterning MT firing according to respiration.</s><s>We therefore compared the dependence of odor coding in the two behavior states on respiratory phase by syncing GC spiking data to breathing.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref> shows 2-D histograms of the response of the same anesthetized state GC analyzed with respect to time relative to stimulus onset or with respect to breath cycle number relative to the first inhalation after stimulus onset.</s><s>Averaging firing rates in time bins relative to stimulus onset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, left histogram) revealed little structure in the response to odors, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>.</s><s>The tuning curve computed from these data during the stimulus was very flat (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, left tuning curve).</s><s>Constructing the histogram such that each bin is a breath, with breath 1 corresponding to the first inhalation of the stimulus (see Online Methods), sufficiently aligned the data to reveal clearer and more widespread changes in spike rate per breath relative to the baseline per breath spiking rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, middle histogram).</s><s>However, the tuning curve computed from these data was still quite flat (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, middle tuning curve).</s></p><p><s>Given our observation that most spiking in anesthetized state GCs occurs in a narrow window of the breath cycle, we assessed whether considering only part of the breath cycle improved stimulus discrimination, and whether the quality of stimulus discrimination was a function of which part of the breath is considered.</s><s>Restricting our firing rate computation to 25% of the breath cycle revealed widespread and robust changes in firing rate per breath to many odors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, right histogram).</s><s>This difference was reflected by a much steeper tuning curve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, right tuning curve).</s><s>The degree of benefit from this analysis was a function of which 25% of the breath cycle was analyzed.</s><s>Sliding the 25% window over the breath cycle revealed a sharp peak in tuning curve variance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, right panel, blue trace) that corresponded with a sharp peak in correlation between the partial breath tuning curve and the time aligned tuning curve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, right panel, red trace).</s></p><p><s>Visual inspection of the three histograms produced in the same manner from an example awake state GC suggested that the quality of stimulus discrimination did not benefit from analysis of firing rate changes during a restricted respiratory phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, high correlation between the partial breath tuning curve and the time-aligned tuning curve was maintained throughout most of the respiratory cycle.</s><s>These qualitative observations suggest that odor information encoded by GCs is distributed throughout the respiratory cycle during wakefulness but is concentrated in a narrow window during anesthesia.</s></p><p><s>To quantify this difference for all cells, we measured the dependence of partial breath tuning curve variance and correlation on respiratory phase angle by measuring the coupling of these variables to the breath cycle.</s><s>Both measures tended to show peaks at specific points in the breath cycle under anesthesia, while during wakefulness both measures tended to be invariant with respiration (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>As a population, compared to anesthetized GCs, awake state GCs exhibited significantly lower respiratory coupling of tuning curve variance (anesthesia coupling strength: 0.59 ± 0.2, n=15; awake coupling strength: 0.29 ± 0.1, n=16; p &lt; 0.001, t test) and correlation to time aligned tuning curves (anesthesia coupling strength: 0.49 ± 0.2, n=15; awake coupling strength: 0.29 ± 0.1, n=16; p &lt; 0.01, t test) (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref> and<ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We further quantified whether partial breath tuning curves improved stimulus discrimination by measuring response modulation index (RMI) as a function of respiratory phase angle.</s><s>We computed RMI values for time aligned data as well as data in a sliding window restricted to 25% of the breath cycle (see Online Methods).</s><s>Where possible, partial breath RMI values were fit with a Gaussian function, and the peak of the Gaussian was taken as the peak RMI for partial breath analysis (e.g.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>, top).</s><s>For cells that could not be well fit with a Gaussian function (e.g.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>, bottom), the mean RMI value over the respiratory cycle was used.</s><s>Considered as a population, anesthetized state GCs exhibited significantly higher RMI values for partial breath as compared to time-aligned analysis (time-aligned firing rate RMI: 0.83 ± 0.2; partial breath-aligned firing rate RMI: 1.27 ± 0.4; n = 15, p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA), whereas awake state GCs did not (time-aligned firing rate RMI: 1.56 ± 0.6; partial breath-aligned firing rate RMI: 1.27 ± 0.4; n = 15, p &gt; 0.05, ANOVA).</s></p><p><s>These data indicate that odorant information is distributed over the entire respiratory cycle during wakefulness.</s><s>Likewise, ongoing activity in awake state GCs has limited temporal structure.</s><s>As a result, odor responses and ongoing activity exhibit slower and steadier dynamics that do not reflect a strong influence of respiration.</s><s>We therefore find no evidence that GCs contribute to any temporal patterns in MTs related to breathing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here we investigated state-dependent activity in GCs of the main olfactory bulb.</s><s>Granule cells are the target of extensive central feedback projections and make reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses onto mitral/tufted cells (MTs).</s><s>They are therefore well poised to be critical effectors of state modulation of MOB output.</s><s>Indeed, we found dramatic differences in ongoing and stimulus-driven activity between GCs recorded in anesthetized and awake mice.</s><s>These differences likely have important consequences for odor coding.</s><s>Specifically, recordings during wakefulness suggest that GCs are likely to have more extensive lateral interactions with mitral cells, but are unlikely to strongly shape their temporal dynamics.</s></p><p><s>The activity of GCs under anesthesia was characterized by temporally sparse bursts that were synchronized across cells.</s><s>As a result, spiking and therefore odorant information is concentrated in a narrow window aligned with respiration.</s><s>Given the limited sampling rate of laser scanning microscopy, this temporal sparseness may explain why odor responses were not readily observed from GCs of anesthetized mice in a recent two photon imaging study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> .</s><s>This is also relatively consistent with whole-cell recordings from GCs under anesthesia, which reveal a highly nonlinear spike threshold mechanism that enforces temporal sparseness despite strong subthreshold input <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> .</s><s>However, our data do stand in contrast with the large, sustained changes in firing rate reported for GCs in one recent study of anesthetized mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> .</s><s>Perhaps this is related to selection of an anesthetic, however we observed similar activity with two common anesthesia regimes (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The awake state was characterized by two major features.</s><s>First, GCs exhibited higher firing rates and stronger, more widespread odor responses.</s><s>Based on the fact that GCs define a circuit enabling mutual inhibition between neighboring MTs, it is widely held that they tune responses of individual MTs and sparsen population representations of odors

to more odors and more sensitively discriminate among them implies that under wakefulness they play a greater role in sculpting MT selectivity through augmented lateral interactions.</s><s>This

regard for the respiratory cycle leads us to conclude that it is unlikely they play a significant role in the enforcement of the respiratory locking exhibited by MTs in awake animals.</s></p><p><s>When compared with the temporal structure of activity observed in MTs in awake animals, our results are surprising in two respects.</s><s>First, several studies have reported reliable stimulus-specific shifts in respiratory phase coupling of MTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> .</s><s>Granule cells have naturally been proposed as a likely contributor to this effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> .</s><s>However, in our data, GCs have a characteristic coupling phase that is invariant to stimuli in both the awake and anesthetized states.</s><s>Thus, if odor-specific phase shifts are accomplished via GC-mediated feedback inhibition, it is more likely to arise from modulation of the amplitude (as opposed to timing) of inhibitory pulses of specific GC ensembles to push and pull the phase of MT coupling.</s><s>Second, the weak respiratory coupling and apparent slow rate coding we observed in GCs during wakefulness stands in contrast to the high temporal precision of MTs recorded under similar conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Because of the strength of reciprocal coupling between GC and MTs, one might expect that GCs sculpt or at least reflect the precise MT bursts that tile the respiratory cycle in awake rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Nonetheless, we failed to find evidence that GCs participate substantially in this phase locking or even passively follow breathing.</s><s>Although we cannot completely exclude highly cooperative population mechanisms for creating temporal structure GCs, our observations limit the potential influence of one or a small number of GCs on respiratory patterning in MTs.</s></p><p><s>Population activity of MTs is read out by the olfactory cortex.</s><s>Considerable evidence argues that the cortex spatially integrates input from multiple glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b56">56</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Synchronous inhibition seems likely to entrain synchronous MT output which may be best extracted by coincidence detection, whereas the slower firing rate changes seen in our awake data may be best served by temporal integration upon readout.</s><s>Potential support for regulated temporal integration comes from recent evidence revealing the existence of an intriguing mechanism for modulating MT synchrony to encode stimulus associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Finally, while the state-dependent modulation we observed was between anesthesia and passive wakefulness, our results demonstrate remarkable lability of the MOB interneuron network.</s><s>This capacity for flexibility is therefore likely exerted to optimize neural processing for a wide range of behavioral conditions.</s></p></div>
