<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Odor cues induce a variety of motivated behaviors which lead to either obtaining rewards or avoiding dangers.</s><s>Although some odorants evoke specific innate motivated responses, such as fear responses to predator odors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kobayakawa et al., 2007)</ref>, animals typically acquire appropriate motivated responses to cue odors based on their prior experience of odor-reward or odor-danger association learning.</s><s>However, little is known about the neuronal circuit mechanisms that translate the learned odor cue information into various motivated behaviors.</s></p><p><s>Odorants detected by olfactory sensory neurons are coded by specific combinations of activated glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay center of the central olfactory system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mori and Sakano, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The odor information is then conveyed to a number of areas in the olfactory cortex which includes the ante-rior piriform cortex (APC), posterior piriform cortex and olfactory tubercle (OT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Neville and Haberly, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>The OT is intriguing in that the nucleus accumbens and OT are anatomically bridged and form the ventral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Millhouse and Heimer, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Heimer et al., 1987)</ref>.</s><s>Whereas principal neurons in most areas of the olfactory cortex are glutamatergic pyramidal cells, principal neurons in the OT and accumbens are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Animals.</s><s>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan and were approved by the Experimental Animal Research Committee of the University of Tokyo.</s><s>C57BL/6 male mice were purchased from Japan SLC, housed individually in plastic cages (24 ϫ 17 ϫ 12 cm) with paper bedding (2 cm depth), and placed in isolation boxes (Natsume Seisakusho) at 26°C under a 12 h light/dark cycle with lights on at 5:00 A.M. Odor-association learning was started when mice were 8-to 10-weeks-old.</s></p><p><s>Odor association learning and behavioral assay.</s><s>For odor and sugar association, mice were food-restricted to achieve 80 -90% of their ad libitum feeding body weight.</s><s>One day before the start of odor-sugar association learning, food pellets were removed and replaced with 0.1 g of a powdered animal diet, which resulted in a decrease in body weight to 80 -90% on the next day.</s><s>A powdered diet of 1.5-2.0</s><s>g per day was then delivered during the training period to maintain the 80 -90% body weight.</s><s>Water was available ad libitum throughout the whole schedule.</s><s>Association of odor and the sugar reward was conducted in a plastic cage (24 ϫ 17 ϫ 12 cm).</s><s>In the first session of day 1, mice were habituated to eating sugar by being served sugar (granulated sucrose; 20 -40 mg) and powdered diet (20 -40 mg) on a holed Petri dish which contained a filter paper (2 ϫ 2 cm) soaked with amyl acetate or eugenol (10% dilution by mineral oil, 40 l; Tokyo Chemical Industry) in the lower compartment.</s><s>In the following four sessions of day 1 the mice underwent association of the sugar reward (without powdered diet) with amyl acetate or eugenol in the same dish.</s><s>The dish was hidden under bedding (2 cm depth) so that the mouse could find the sugar by smell, with the hiding position randomly chosen from each corner of the conditioning cage.</s><s>To avoid possible secondary effects of training such as changes in metabolic state by prolonged food restriction, we determined the minimum period (days) of association learning for inducing odor-guided approach behavior, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carr, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Although some mice did not approach the buried cue odor and sugar on day 2 trials, they all showed a rapid approach to them within 5 s on the last (fourth) trial on day 3 and on all trials on days 4 and 5. Based on this observation, training for 3 consecutive days (4 associations per day) was consistently applied.</s><s>For the control group of mice receiving odor delivery without sugar reward ("odor ϩ no sugar" group), mice underwent the same training procedures as the sugar-associated odor group except that they did not receive the sugar.</s></p><p><s>Association of odor and the electrical shock punishment was conducted in a foot shock chamber (18 ϫ 11 ϫ 12 cm, O'hara) containing the cap of a centrifuge tube with mineral oil (40 l).</s><s>For habituation, the mice were transferred to the foot shock chamber for 30 min.</s><s>This habituation was repeated four times before odor and shock delivery.</s><s>Soon after the habituation, amyl acetate or eugenol (10% dilution by mineral oil, 40 l, Tokyo Chemical Industry) was introduced into the cap.</s><s>Mice were continually exposed to amyl acetate or eugenol, and delivered the electrical shock (0.2-0.4 s, 0.4 mA) at 0.5, 5, 15, and 25 min after the start of odor exposure (total of 4 electrical shocks).</s><s>The mice were further exposed to amyl acetate or eugenol for an additional 5 min, and then transferred to their home cage.</s><s>To avoid possible secondary effects of extended training, such as fear response to experimenters, we determined the minimum period (days) of association learning for inducing odor-guided aversive behavior.</s><s>Because training for only 1 d induced significant odor-guided aversive behavior on the following days in all mice examined, this training period was consistently applied.</s><s>For the control group of mice receiving odor delivery without shock punishment ("odor ϩ no shock" group), mice underwent the same training procedures as the shock-associated odor group except that they did not receive the electrical shock.</s></p><p><s>After the training, all mice received ad libitum feeding for 1 day, were fasted for 18 -20 h, and then received odor or air delivery for the examination of behavioral responses and c-Fos activity.</s><s>Amyl acetate or eugenol (10% dilution in mineral oil, 0.2 ml) was delivered into the home cage via a tube whose end was implanted at the center of the cage.</s><s>The air delivery group instead received 0.2 ml of air.</s><s>To reduce individual variation in mouse baseline behaviors, odor delivery was performed in the light-on period (3-4 h after light first on), when mice typically show rest or sleep behavior.</s><s>Animal behavior around the odor or air delivery was recorded with a digital video camera and the first 10 min after delivery was analyzed.</s></p><p><s>Categorization of mouse behaviors.</s><s>Behavior was categorized into six types: digging, vigilant behavior, grooming, locomotive exploration, nonlocomotive body movement, and rest/sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Crawley, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Digging indicates that mice were digging the bedding.</s><s>Vigilant behavior indicates that mice showed freezing (completely motionless except for respiration with head elevating), head retraction (retracting the head after sniffing the place of the odor outlet), or alert exploration (taking a lowered posture, staying away from the odor outlet, and moving around the outer area of the cage).</s><s>Grooming indicates that mice were grooming the body.</s><s>Locomotive exploration indicates that mice were walking/running or rearing.</s><s>Nonlocomotive body movement indicates that mice stayed at one place with sniffing around or handling the bedding.</s><s>Rest/sleep indicates that mice stayed at one place calmly with the head dropped.</s><s>Behaviors that lasted longer than 2 s were evaluated.</s><s>At 30 min after delivery, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) for histological examination.</s><s>Behavioral data were confirmed by an independent researcher who was blind to the experimental conditions of the animals.</s></p><p><s>Sample preparation for histochemistry.</s><s>Mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital.</s><s>They were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA.</s><s>The brain was removed from the skull, immersed in 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) overnight, and then transferred to 30% sucrose in RNase-free 0.1 M PB.</s><s>The brain was then embedded in the OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical), frozen at Ϫ80°C, and sliced into coronal sections with a thickness of 20 m with a cryotome.</s><s>Sections were rinsed in RNase-free PBS and 0.1 M PB, mounted on slide glasses (PLATINUM coat, Matsunami) using a paint brash, dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator, and then stored at 4°C until
