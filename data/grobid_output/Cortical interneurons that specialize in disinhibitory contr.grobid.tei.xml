<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Cortical inhibitory interneurons display great diversity in their physiology, connectivity and synaptic dynamics, but it has long been debated whether and to what extent function of an interneuron type follows from a unique combination of these properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>The possibility that different interneuron cell types perform distinct circuit operations holds great promise for unraveling the logic of cortical microcircuits.</s><s>Nevertheless, little is known about the functional roles of different interneuron subtypes, especially in awake and behaving animals.</s><s>Multiple populations of interneurons differentially target distinct subregions of pyramidal cells leading to different modes of inhibitory control.</s><s>Disinhibition of principal neurons mediated by inhibition targeted onto other inhibitory neurons can provide an additional layer of control, generating a powerful computational mechanism for increasing the gain of principal neurons.</s><s>Recent work identified a population of layer 1 interneurons that mediate disinhibitory control over cortical processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and thereby enable associative learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Previous studies proposed that VIP expressing interneurons are a candidate cell type specializing in disinhibition because they appear to mainly target other interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . Ind</s><s>ed, VIP expression demarcates a small population of all interneurons (~10%), distinct from the two major interneuron populations defined by parvalbumin (Pv) and somatostatin (Som) expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>However, whether and how VIP interneurons mediate disinhibition in vivo and when they are recruited during behaviour has remained elusive.</s></p><p><s>We examined the function of VIP interneurons in two functionally different cortical regions, auditory cortex (ACx) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).</s><s>Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , a light-activated cation channel, was targeted to VIP neurons using a VIP-ires-Cre <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> knockin mouse line by either breeding with Ai32 22 (ChR2 reporter line) or using viral delivery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-d</ref>).</s><s>To explore the function of VIP interneurons in circuit operations, we acquired extracellular recordings in awake mice using miniature microdrives that house an optical fiber and six tetrodes for simultaneous light stimulation and recording (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We first characterized the impact of VIP neurons on the cortical network by synchronously activating them using 1ms light-pulses in ACx and mPFC.</s><s>Brief light stimulation of this sparse population of VIP-expressing interneurons (1-2% of cortical neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ) resulted in a disproportionately broad effect, generating significant firing rate changes in ~20% of cortical cells (ACx: 130/495, mPFC: 26/155) for tens to hundreds of milliseconds following the pulse.</s><s>Examination of the light-triggered activity profiles of neurons revealed three distinct groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c-h</ref>).</s><s>The first group of neurons was strongly activated at a very low latency (ACx: 2.5¬±0.22ms,</s><s>mPFC: 1.3¬±0.40ms),</s><s>with low jitter (ACx: 1.4¬±0.21,</s><s>mPFC: 1.1¬±0.10ms),</s><s>and high reliability across trials (ACx: 0.62¬±0.10 at 0.5Hz, mPFC: 0.64¬±0.17</s><s>at 10-20Hz), indicative of direct light-activation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Because ChR2 is expressed under the control of the VIP promoter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we concluded that the directly activated group consists of VIP interneurons.</s><s>A second group of neurons was inhibited by the photostimulation at short, reliable delays (inhibition trough: ACx 10ms, mPFC 7ms), consistent with monosynaptic inhibition generated by inhibitory VIP neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, g, h and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Many, but not all neurons in this inhibited group had narrow spike widths (ACx: 237¬±7Œºs, mPFC: 225¬±7Œºs) and high firing rates (ACx: 7.4¬±0.7Hz,</s><s>mPFC: 17.5¬±4.2Hz;</s><s>see Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>), hallmarks of fast-spiking interneurons, usually expressing parvalbumin (Pv) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>The inhibited group also contained a subgroup of neurons that was first suppressed by photoactivation of VIP and later activated (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>A third group of neurons was activated by photostimulation at longer delays and with more temporal spread (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>, g, h and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Neurons in this group had wider spikes (ACx: 316¬±7Œºs, mPFC: 339¬±12Œºs) and lower firing rates (ACx: 3.2¬±0.5Hz,</s><s>mPFC: 9.2¬±2.7Hz)</s><s>compared to the inhibited group (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>), suggesting that many of these were pyramidal neurons.</s><s>An analysis of the timing and extent of light-induced firing rate change revealed that neural responses indeed clustered into three distinguishable groups: shortlatency activated followed by inhibited and finally delayed activated neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>This excitation-inhibition-excitation sequence, observed in two functionally different cortical regions, is the signature of a disinhibition process: activated VIP interneurons inhibit other interneurons, releasing some pyramidal neurons from inhibitory control.</s><s>These data represent the first in vivo demonstration of cell-type-specific disinhibition, confirming previous suggestions based on connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that VIP interneurons provide disinhibitory control.</s></p><p><s>To dissect the circuit mechanisms of disinhibition and identify the cell types that are monosynaptically inhibited by VIP neurons, we turned to the in vitro slice preparation.</s><s>VIP interneurons likely target Som and/or Pv interneurons, the two largest non-overlapping populations (~65% of all interneurons) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>To examine which of these interneuron subtypes might mediate VIP-initiated disinhibition, we bred VIP-Cre mice with GIN-GFP mice, labeling a subpopulation of Som-expressing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> neurons, and separately with G42-GFP mice, labeling a subpopulation of Pv-expressing interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Viral delivery of ChR2 into the ACx or mPFC of these mice enabled us to selectivity photostimulate VIP interneurons and record the responses of either Som or Pv interneurons identified by epifluorescence in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Similar to the in vivo conditions, photostimulation in vitro reliably evoked action potentials in VIP neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Activation of VIP interneurons elicited IPSCs from a large fraction of Som interneurons (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Repeated stimulation of VIP neurons at 40Hz revealed that these inhibitory connections onto Som interneurons undergo short-term synaptic depression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>VIP activation elicited IPSCs in a smaller fraction of Pv interneurons (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Inhibitory currents (IPSCs) recorded in Pv neurons decayed faster than those recorded from Som neurons (decay time constant; Som: 18¬±2ms, Pv: 6¬±1ms), and also displayed stronger short-term synaptic depression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to these inhibitory neurons only a small fraction of pyramidal neurons responded to VIP activation, suggesting that pyramidal neurons are a minor monosynaptic target of the VIP population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>The amplitudes of IPSCs were not significantly different across groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>These in vitro results demonstrate that VIP interneurons specifically inhibit other interneurons, providing a circuit mechanism for a disinhibitory process that we observed in vivo.</s></p><p><s>Since Som and Pv are known to inhibit pyramidal cells, which constitute the majority of cortical neurons, we suspected that the delayed activated neurons in vivo were mostly pyramids.</s><s>To test this we used immunohistochemistry to map the neural activity marker c-Fos onto identified cell-types in vitro in mPFC (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Photostimulation of VIP neurons increased c-Fos expression 5-fold compared to control animals (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5b-h</ref>).</s><s>Eight percent of c-Fos-immunopositive neurons expressed VIP, while the others expressed the pyramidal marker CaMKIIŒ± (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>), revealing that the delayed activated population consists of pyramidal neurons.</s></p><p><s>To probe the function of this disinhibitory circuit during sensory processing, we investigated how auditory receptive fields are shaped by VIP activation.</s><s>About a quarter of the single units recorded in head-restrained awake mice (VIP-Cre::Ai32) (98/343) could be classified as directly activated (n=4, VIP, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), inhibited (n=48), or delayed activated (n=46, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>).</s><s>Delayed activated neurons tended to be more tone-responsive (28/46, 61%, compared to 98/343, 29% in the entire population) and had stronger auditory responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-f</ref>).</s><s>Also, a large fraction of tone-responsive neurons was delayed activated (28/98, 29%, compared to 18/245, 7% in the tone-unresponsive population), and these showed stronger light effects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-f</ref>, and Extended Data Table .</s><s>1).</s><s>These results reveal that in auditory cortex, the VIP circuit disinhibits a functionally specific subset of neurons that tend to be tone-responsive and frequency-tuned.</s></p><p><s>Next, we examined how VIP-mediated disinhibition modulates auditory frequency tuning.</s><s>The inhibited population (n=25 of 97 tone-responsive neurons) decreased while delayed activated neurons (n=28 of 97) increased their tone-evoked firing when VIP interneurons were also activated, consistent with the modulation expected from the disinhibitory circuit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c-f</ref>).</s><s>We found that one-parameter gain modulation models (additive or multiplicative) fitted the light-induced changes in average tuning curves: the inhibited population showed divisive gain modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , whereas the change in delayed activated neurons was consistent with an additive shift of the baseline firing rate (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c-f</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7g</ref>).</s><s>These observations reveal that VIP stimulation modulates the gain of auditory cortical responses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Having established how VIP activation modulates local circuit activity next we investigated</head><p><s>under what behavioural conditions are VIP neurons recruited.</s><s>We recorded the activity of VIP neurons during an auditory go/no-go discrimination task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>VIP neurons were recorded early in training as these sessions had a large number of false alarm (FA) responses to the 'no-go' cue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>We found that VIP neurons showed surprisingly homogeneous responses to reinforcement feedback signals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>-f and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>In all VIP neurons punishment (air puff, n=6 or foot shock, n=4) generated strong phasic activation at short latencies (peak at 50¬±12ms, p&lt;0.01).</s><s>The similar activation in response to two different types of punishment suggests that VIP neurons signal the aversive quality of the negative feedback.</s><s>Water reward tended to generate somewhat weaker and more sustained firing rate increases (9/10 VIP neurons, half maximum duration 1.2s; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, unidentified neurons showed heterogeneous responses around the time of reinforcement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>; FA activation: 23/130, Hit activation: 34/130, FA suppression: 25/130, Hit suppression: 30/130 or no change).</s><s>A small subpopulation of unidentified neurons responded to both reward and punishment (17/130).</s><s>However, these responses tended to precede the feedback, suggesting sustained auditory responses to the cue, unlike the abrupt firing rate increase of VIP interneurons after punishment delivery (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref> and<ref type="figure"></ref> Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref>).</s><s>These results reveal that VIP interneurons respond in unison to reinforcement feedback, distinct from the more diverse responses observed in the rest of the cortical population.</s></p><p><s>Genetic targeting and optical activation enabled us to map a particular circuit function, disinhibitory control, onto a molecularly defined cell-type.</s><s>Based on the strong disinhibitory impact and target selectivity observed in two cytoarchitectonically and functionally different cortical areas, we propose that the disinhibitory microcircuit mediated by VIP expressing interneurons represents a conserved motif in neocortex.</s></p><p><s>VIP interneurons function within a highly interconnected network, therefore their role can be understood as pre-synaptic drivers of ('impact') and post-synaptic responders to ('recruitment') other neurons.</s><s>In terms of impact, we found that VIP neurons mediate disinhibitory control.</s><s>In terms of recruitment, we identified a behaviourally relevant condition, reinforcement feedback, that uniformly activates VIP neurons.</s><s>The homogeneous behavioural recruitment of VIPs suggests that the synchronous ChR2-mediated activation to probe their circuit function was physiologically plausible.</s><s>VIP interneurons are ideally positioned to serve as a substrate for long-range inputs to increase the gain of local cortical processing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>).</s><s>Elegant studies have recently demonstrated a similar disinhibitory process <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , whereby foot-shock-induced cholinergic activation of layer 1 cortical neurons in ACx enabled auditory fear learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, most VIP interneurons are located in superficial layers, including layer 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>However, the extent to which these two disinhibitory circuits overlap remains to be determined, as only a fraction of layer 1 interneurons express VIP.</s><s>VIP interneurons express ionotropic receptors for cholinergic (nAChR) and serotonergic (5HT3a) modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> , suggesting that they are also subject to rapid neuromodulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>These neuromodulatory systems or other longrange pathways likely convey information about reinforcement events to VIP neurons.</s><s>By rapidly relaying this signal primarily to tone-selective neurons locally, VIP interneurons might contribute to cortical learning mechanisms.</s><s>Based on these observations we propose that disinhibitory control by VIP interneurons provides a powerful circuit mechanism that enables long-range cortical signals or subcortical neuromodulation to efficiently modulate specific pyramidal neuron ensembles.</s></p></div>
