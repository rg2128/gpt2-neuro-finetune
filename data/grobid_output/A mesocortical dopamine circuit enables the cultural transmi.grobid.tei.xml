target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1ac</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a-c</ref>).</s><s>In the mammalian PAG, DA neurons encode information about social context, arousal in response to behaviorally salient stimuli, or reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , raising the possibility that the PAG to HVC pathway in juvenile finches encodes information about the tutor that facilitates song imitation.</s><s>To explore this idea, we implanted tetrodes into the PAG of juvenile male finches raised in isolation from a tutor (tutor-naive juveniles; see Methods) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d-k</ref>).</s><s>Most PAG neurons (81.8%: 18/22 neurons from 4 birds) increased their action potential activity in the presence of a singing tutor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1e-g, k</ref>), whereas PAG activity was unaffected during encounters with non-singing adult male finches or female finches, which do not sing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1i-j, k</ref>).</s><s>Neural activity in the juvenile's PAG was not precisely locked to syllables of the tutor song, was variable across different tutor song bouts, and could remain elevated for hundreds of milliseconds after the tutor stopped singing (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2cf</ref>), suggesting that PAG activity evoked by a singing tutor is not simply auditory in nature.</s><s>Indeed, playback of adult finch song from a speaker, including that of a recent tutor, failed to evoke activity in the juvenile's PAG (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1h,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, song playback from a speaker in the presence of an adult female bird failed to activate PAG neurons in tutor-naive juveniles (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, PAG neurons in juvenile males respond strongly and selectively to a live singing tutor and thus can signal the presence of a suitable song model.</s><s>These findings raise the possibility that experience of a singing tutor stimulates DA release from PAG terminals in HVC.</s><s>We explored this idea by virally expressing a modified dopamine type 2 (D2) receptor in HVC neurons of tutor-naive juvenile males that increases fluorescence upon DA binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>) (AAV 2/9 GRAB DA1h ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>We then head-fixed these juvenile males in the awake state and used two-photon imaging methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> to establish that DA levels in HVC increase in the presence of a singing tutor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c-d, i</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, DArelated changes in fluorescence were not detected in the juvenile's HVC in response to song playback (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>), or when the juvenile encountered non-singing adult males or females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f,</ref><ref type="figure">g,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>), paralleling the selective enhancement of PAG activity elicited by a singing tutor.</s><s>Moreover, ablating DA neurons in the pupil's PAG with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> ) prevented tutor-evoked DA transients in the pupil's HVC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>), confirming that tutor-evoked DA release in the pupil's HVC largely originates from the PAG To explore whether DA signaling in HVC plays a role in song imitation, we used 6-OHDA to lesion DA-releasing fibers in the HVC of juvenile male finches raised continuously with adult male tutors and tracked their song development into adulthood (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a-c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s><s>Lesions of DA-releasing fibers in HVC made near the onset of the sensitive period for tutor song memorization (30 days-post-hatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> or 30 d) prevented song copying (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d-e</ref>) without affecting the overall rate of singing (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>).</s><s>As adults, these 6-OHDA treated birds produced abnormally long and acoustically simple syllables, similar to finches raised in isolation from a tutor <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>The 6-OHDA lesions made in HVC in 30 d males are permanent and thus could potentially interfere with tutor song memorization (i.e., sensory learning), the subsequent phase of song copying (sensorimotor learning), or both.</s><s>However, 6-OHDA lesions made in the HVC of 45 d males, which have had sufficient tutor experience to enable accurate copying but are just beginning sensorimotor learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , did not affect the juvenile's ability to copy a tutor song (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These findings suggest that DA signaling in HVC plays a role in sensory learning but cannot exclude a more general but developmentally restricted (before 45d, e.g.) role for such signaling.</s><s>Therefore, we used microdialysis methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> to reversibly block DA receptors in the HVC <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> of tutor-naive juvenile males (Age: 43.0 ± 4.9 d [mean ± SD], n = 5) while they were housed with a tutor for 1.5 h on five consecutive days, allowing us to better determine whether DA signaling in HVC is crucial during pupil-tutor interactions, when sensory learning occurs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3g-h</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5a-c</ref>).</s><s>Reversibly blocking DA receptors in HVC during but not just after tutoring sessions blocked song copying (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3h</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5b-c</ref>), without affecting juveniles' attentive behaviors to tutors or tutors' singing rates (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>-e, Supplementary Video 1-2).</s><s>Moreover, reversibly suppressing PAG activity in the pupil with muscimol during daily tutoring sessions also blocked song copying; notably, juveniles in which PAG was inactivated also failed to orient to their tutors, even though tutors continued singing at normal rates (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>h, Supplementary Video 3).</s><s>Thus, tutor-evoked activation of the pupil's PAG and concomitant release of DA in HVC are essential to encoding tutor song experience, and PAG activity may be required for the pupil to attend to a singing tutor.</s></p><p><s>The current findings do not exclude the possibility that DA signaling at other sites also contributes to sensory learning.</s><s>One potential site is the basal ganglia region Area X <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , which receives dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta (VTA/SNc), as well as from a smaller cohort of TH+ PAG neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d-g</ref>), and where dopamine signaling plays a role in sensorimotor learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Nonetheless, infusing DA receptor blockers into Area X of juvenile males during daily tutoring sessions did not affect song copying (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Another potential site is the caudal mesopallium (CM), an auditory forebrain region important to song memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>However, blocking DA receptors in the CM of juvenile males during daily tutoring sessions did not block song copying (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5i-k</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These results show that DA release from PAG axon terminals in HVC (PAG HVC terminals) signals the presence of a suitable model and helps encode this model in the pupil's brain.</s><s>Consequently, artificially activating PAG HVC terminals should compensate for the absence of a live tutor and facilitate vocal copying in response to song playback.</s><s>To test this idea, we used AAVs to express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) bilaterally in the PAG of tutor-naive juvenile males (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3i-j</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-d</ref>).</s><s>Several weeks (33.3 ± 7.4 days [mean ± SD], n = 6) later, we implanted optical fibers bilaterally over HVC and optogenetically activated PAG HVC terminals while playing an adult male zebra finch song through a speaker.</s><s>Pairing PAG HVC terminal stimulation with song playback resulted in a significant level of song copying compared to juveniles that had only been exposed to song playback, or to song playback and optical illumination of HVC in the absence of ChR2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3j</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>; see Methods).</s><s>Moreover, pairing song playback with PAG HVC terminal stimulation while infusing DA blockers into HVC did not lead to song copying in tutor-naive juveniles (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7e-g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To explore how tutor-evoked DA release from PAG HVC axon terminals alters HVC to drive song imitation, we implanted tetrodes in the HVC of tutor-naive juveniles and recorded neural activity before and after their initial encounters with a singing tutor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Spontaneous burst firing in HVC neurons increased within 1 h after the juvenile's initial exposure to a singing tutor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b-c, e</ref>), without any change in their mean firing rates (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8d</ref>).</s><s>Because burst firing in HVC is driven by auditory afferents <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , this enhanced bursting suggests that tutoring rapidly potentiates auditory inputs to HVC.</s><s>In fact, brief (35.0 ± 16.8 min [mean ± SD]) experience with a singing tutor led rapidly (~1 h) to the emergence of temporally precise responses in the awake juvenile HVC to tutor song playback (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4d</ref>, f, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8a-c</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the mean firing rate of HVC neurons to song playback was unaffected by tutoring (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8e-f</ref>), indicating that neural responses in HVC became more tightly locked to specific features in the tutor song.</s><s>None of these juveniles (n = 4) sang during or for several hours after the tutoring session, and thus these physiological changes were not simply the result of auditory feedback associated with vocal rehearsal.</s><s>In another set of tutor-naive juvenile males, we found that tutoring rapidly reduced the kurtosis of vocal duration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4g-h</ref>) and increased the mean entropy variance of the juveniles' songs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4i</ref>), two early hallmarks of song copying <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Notably, blocking DA signaling in the pupil's HVC with 6-OHDA or DA blockers prevented these physiological and behavioral changes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4e,</ref><ref type="figure">f,</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The discovery that DA neurons in the pupil's PAG are strongly and selectively activated by a singing tutor parallels an emerging body of evidence that potentially homologous neurons in the mammal can encode social cues, including those related to reward, context, or novelty <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, the present findings advance a model in which both social cues and the song-related auditory input provided by the singing tutor drive the coincident activation of DA receptors and auditory synapses in HVC, leading to the rapid emergence of auditory representations of the tutor's song necessary to song imitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref>).</s><s>This coincident encoding mechanism could help ensure that the pupil's brain selectively forms representations of songs produced by suitable adult tutors, and not of extraneous auditory stimuli.</s><s>Although DA-dependent modulation of auditory cortical representations has previously been linked to perceptual learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , a notable feature of the DA-dependent process of auditory encoding described here is that it occurs in a vocal motor region and rapidly drives vocal imitation.</s><s>More broadly, DA signaling is enhanced in the motor cortex of primates relative to other mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , raising the possibility that augmented DA signaling in motor regions of songbirds and primates reflects a convergent neural architecture for promoting motor imitation in response to social models.</s></p></div>
