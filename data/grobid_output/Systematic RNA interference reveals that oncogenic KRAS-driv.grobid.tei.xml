data by the t-test statistic or the signal-tonoise ratio to account for the difference in means between the two classes as well as the standard deviation across samples.</s><s>Specifically, the difference in mean viability scores induced by each shRNA in the KRAS mutant class versus the wildtype class was normalized to its standard deviation using a t-test, and shRNAs were ranked by the t-test score to determine for class selective effects.</s><s>To convert shRNA data to candidate genes and to reduce the likelihood of off-target effects, the top 250 (5%) of distinguishing shRNAs in the mutant KRAS class were filtered to identify several shRNAs targeting the same gene.</s><s>Only those genes for which at least one shRNA yielded a mean B score ,21 across the KRAS mutant class were

Pre-processing: the input was the same data set of B-scores analysed using the individual shRNA-based method.</s><s>The B-score values for each cell line were standardized with respect to the median and maximum absolute deviation of the set of control shRNAs (directed against GFP, LacZ, RFP and luciferase) in the same cell line.</s><s>This centred and rescaled the values in a sample-specific manner according to the behaviour of the control hairpins.</s><s>After normalization, values below 23 and above 3 were truncated to 23 and 3, respectively, to reduce the effect of outliers, and were called normalized survival scores.</s></p><p><s>(2) Feature ranking: after pre-processing, each shRNA was assigned a 'differential survival score', which represented the difference in means of the normalized survival scores in the two phenotypic classes (for example, KRAS mutant versus wild type).</s><s>The difference in means was used to emphasize the absolute magnitude of the survival differences and not only the profile 'shape'.</s><s>Specifically, this favoured shRNAs with strong differential killing of cells over ones that exhibited weak differential killing of cells, but had perfect discrimination profiles inside classes.</s><s>The differential survival scores were computed for all the 5,002 shRNAs and sorted from high to low scores.</s></p><p><s>(3) Calculation of enrichment scores: a given gene was assigned an enrichment score according to the distribution of differential survival scores of its shRNAs within the rank list of all shRNAs using a two-sample weighted 'Zhang C' statistic based on the likelihood ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>The Zhang C likelihood ratio statistic was used owing to its greater sensitivity and better empirical results in exploratory analyses with other data sets.</s><s>We adapted this method to separate positive and negative enrichment contributions, and used a weighting factor based on the differential enrichment score, except for scores between 20.5 and 0.5, which were truncated to reduce the effects of shRNAs that weakly distinguished classes.</s><s>The enrichment score obtained in this manner was representative of both the extremeness of the shRNA differential survival scores for a given gene and their consistency.</s></p><p><s>(4) Normalization of enrichment scores: because genes with different numbers of shRNAs were assigned enrichment scores on different scales, we normalized them before sorting the genes by using a null distribution generated by 1,000 random permutations of the locations of the shRNAs in the entire list.</s><s>The normalization for negative enrichment scores was a rescaling by the absolute value of the mean of the negative values in the null distribution.</s><s>This represented an effective way to place the enrichment scores on a common scale regardless of the number of shRNAs for each gene.</s><s>The null distribution also provided nominal P values for each gene enrichment score.</s></p><p><s>(5) Generation of results: the analysis resulted in a list of genes sorted by their NESs, and a set of complementary estimates of statistical significance, such as nominal, family-wise and Bonferroni P values plus a FDR.</s><s>A collection of dualvertical plots was used to demonstrate the shRNA differential survival scores for each gene (lines in blue) and NESs (lines in red).</s><s>Vertical plots were arranged starting with the top gene (strongest negative NES) on the left.</s><s>Secondary screen.</s><s>Analysis of secondary screen data followed the same methodology except for the normalization of the cell proliferation/viability data.</s><s>Twenty control shRNAs directed against RFP, LacZ and luciferase were screened in parallel with candidates.</s><s>We normalized data for each shRNA in each cell line using the percentage of control statistic, dividing the raw data for each shRNA by the median of control shRNA values, and taking the log 10 of this number to scale values around zero.</s><s>Because of the biased nature of the candidate shRNA plate, and because the number of control shRNAs was smaller in the secondary screen than the first, the calculation of the maximum absolute deviation was noisy and unreliable.</s><s>No truncation was applied to the resulting values.</s></p><p><s>A larger set of 84 control shRNAs directed against GFP, RFP, LacZ and luciferase was also tested independently in all eight cell lines chosen for the secondary screen.</s><s>We normalized data for each shRNA in each cell line by dividing the raw data for each control shRNA by the plate median and taking the log 10 of this number to scale values around zero.</s><s>We used the t-test statistic to examine the KRAS mutant versus wild-type class distinction for this control plate relative to the candidate plate, restricting the analysis to shRNAs with strong effects on proliferation/viability (mutant KRAS class mean log percentage of control ,20.2, corresponding to ,37% viability impairment) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>We used the t-test statistic threshold that was achieved by the set of control shRNAs as the boundary to identify the top 25 shRNAs KRAS synthetic lethal shRNAs that scored on the candidate plate (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>) Gene expression profiling or GSEA.</s><s>RNA was prepared from AALE cells expressing KRAS(G12V) or a control vector 6 days after infection and analysed using human U133A HTA Arrays (Affymetrix).</s><s>GSEA was performed using gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB-C2 v2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>In brief, the method consists of the following steps: genes are first ranked in a list, L, by the correlation between their expression and the class distinction (for example, KRAS mutant versus wild type), using a suitable correlation metric.</s><s>Given a defined set of genes S (for example, genes members of a signalling pathway, located in the same genomic region, sharing the same Gene Ontology category, and so on), the goal of GSEA is to determine whether the members of S are found at the top or bottom of the list, indicating that they associate with the phenotypic distinction, rather than being distributed uniformly or randomly across the list.</s><s>Next, to evaluate this degree of 'enrichment', an enrichment score is calculated to quantify the degree to which a set S is over-represented at the top or bottom of the entire ranked list L. After calculation of the scores for a collection of gene sets, an empirical phenotype-based permutation test procedure is used to estimate P values.</s><s>The permutation of class labels preserves gene-gene correlations and provides an assessment of significance that is more reflective of the underlying biology.</s><s>Finally, an adjustment is made to the estimated significance level to account for multiple hypotheses testing.</s><s>GSEA normalizes the enrichment score for each gene set to account for the variation in set sizes, yielding a NES and a FDR.</s><s>The FDR gives an estimate of the probability that a set with a given NES represents a false-positive finding; it is computed by comparing the tails of the observed and permutation-computed null distributions for the NES.</s><s>The collection of gene sets used in the analysis of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref> consisted of release 2.5 of the C2 (curated gene sets) sub-collection of the Molecular Signatures Database (http:// www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/msigdb/).</s><s>To determine the significance of identifying many NF-kB upregulated gene sets enriched in AALE-K cells, we used a hypergeometric test.</s></p><p><s>Gene expression profiling was also performed in triplicate in AALE-K cells (KRAS(G13D)) 5 passages after stable integration of the KRAS allele and compared with AALE-V cells using human U133A Arrays (Affymetrix).</s><s>We created a new KRAS-specific gene signature using the mean difference in expression between AALE-K and AALE-V triplicate samples to determine the 300 most significantly induced genes by oncogenic KRAS.</s><s>In parallel, expression profiling was performed in AALE-K cells 48 h after expression of GFP shRNA or TBK1 shRNA, to identify which of these genes were most significantly downregulated after TBK1 suppression.</s><s>Signature projection method.</s><s>The RAS oncogenic signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , AALE-K signature, NF-kB signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , IKKe-regulated NF-kB gene set <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and IRF3 target gene set <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> were projected across 38 lung adenocarcinomas derived from the doi:10.1038/nature08460</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 | Meta-analysis of RNAi screens identifying KRAS synthetic lethals.</s><s>a, Supervised analysis of viability data (B-score) identified 250 shRNAs that distinguished mutant KRAS from wild-type (WT) cells, including genes targeted by several shRNAs.</s><s>b, Hairpin-set analysis (RIGER).</s><s>Genes were assigned NESs (red lines) on the basis of KRAS mutant/wild-type differential survival scores (blue lines) for each shRNA.</s><s>Negative values represent mutant KRAS-selectivity.</s><s>c, Union of 17 genes identified in a and 40 genes identified in b. d, Secondary screening data normalized using the percentage of control and analysed using RIGER.</s><s>The FDR values for KRAS and TBK1 were 0.04 and 0.18, respectively.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="1,307.79,356.53,252.38,222.14" type="bitmap" /></figure>
