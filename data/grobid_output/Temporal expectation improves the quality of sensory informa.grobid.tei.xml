<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects on reaction time</head><p><s>We compared participants' reaction times (RTs) to targets presented in the regular and irregular conditions.</s><s>RTs for correct responses from the two conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) were submitted to a repeated-measures ANOVA with Temporal Expectation and Target Contrast as factors.</s><s>We found a significant main effect of Target Contrast (F (2.26,27.07)</s><s>ϭ 63.88; p Ͻ 0.001), with shorter RTs for targets with a higher contrast.</s><s>RTs were also shorter for targets in regular versus irregular condition (F (1,12) ϭ 12.41; p Ͻ 0.01).</s><s>The interaction between the factors was not significant (F (3.59,43.09)</s><s>ϭ 0.40; p Ͼ 0.7).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffusion model</head><p><s>To determine the component(s) of information processing responsible for the concurrent increase in target discriminability and reaction speed observed between regular and irregular conditions, we fitted simultaneously the group-level psychometric (relationship between target contrast and discriminability) and chronometric (relationship between target contrast and reaction speed) functions using a diffusion model of the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Palmer et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Briefly, this model proposes that simple perceptual decisions, such as the left-versus right-tilt discrimination used in our experiment, are based on the gradual accumulation of noisy sensory evidence favoring either interpretation at an accumulation rate k until a signed decision bound ϮA is reached (e.g., ϩA for a lefttilt decision, or ϪA for a right-tilt decision).</s><s>The reaction time for each decision taken by the model corresponds to the decision time required to reach either of the decision bounds.</s><s>A residual time constant, t R , is also added to account for other nondecision processes such as sensory and motor encoding latencies, whose variability is assumed to be much smaller than the variability in decision time <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ratcliff and Smith, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>In this implementation of the diffusion model, the accumulation rate k is defined in signal-to-noise units, so that an increase in k corresponds to a more precise representation of the relevant evidence/signal (here, the tilt of the noisy target).</s><s>Importantly, k is not merely an amplification of both signal plus noise, which would not change the overall signal-to-noise ratio, but a selective amplification of the signal component.</s><s>In contrast, a change in A corresponds to a change in the speed-accuracy trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Palmer et al., 2005)</ref>, without any change in the quality of the relevant evidence.</s></p><p><s>As a first step, we fitted separately, using maximum-likelihood estimation (see Materials and Methods, above), the regular and irregular conditions using the diffusion model with three free parameters for each fit: the accumulation rate k, the decisionbound A, and the residual time constant t R (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Each set of three parameters was sufficient to describe accurately the grouplevel psychometric and chronometric functions at the tested target contrasts.</s></p><p><s>We then asked what subset of these three parameters was best able to explain the effect of temporal expectation (i.e., the difference between regular and irregular conditions) on psychometric and chronometric functions.</s><s>We used hierarchical model comparison via log-likelihood ratio tests between nested models (see Materials and Methods, above) to determine which of the three model parameters (the accumulation rate k, the decision-bound A, or the residual time constant t R ) could explain the observed difference between regular and irregular conditions significantly better than a null model for which the three parameters had fixed values across the two conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>To do so, we fitted simultaneously the regular and irregular conditions using three candidate models with four best-fitting parameter values: two parameters with fixed values across the two conditions, and one parameter allowed to take different values in the two conditions.</s></p><p><s>An increase in the accumulation rate k explained the observed difference between regular and irregular conditions significantly better than the null model [log-likelihood ratio test (LLR) ϭ 2.51, p ϭ 0.02], whereas changes in either the decision-bound A (LLR ϭ 0.04, p Ͼ 0.5) or the residual time constant t R (LLR ϭ 0.67, p Ͼ 0.2) were no better than the null model given their extra free parameter.</s><s>Importantly, the model allowing for all three parameters to change between regular and irregular conditions was also not better than the null model (LLR ϭ 2.64, p ϭ 0.15) given its three extra free parameters.</s><s>In conclusion, only an increase in the accumulation rate k was able to explain the concurrent effects of temporal expectation on psychometric and chronometric functions.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we sought to confirm this effect by comparing the changes in threshold predicted by each model with our experimental data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>To do so, we determined the threshold difference predicted by models allowing for a change either in accumulation rate k, decision-bound A, or residual time constant t R between regular and irregular conditions.</s><s>We then compared the predicted difference with the group-level results.</s><s>Consistent with previous analyses, we found that changes in decision-bound A or in residual time constant t R elicited results that are significantly different from our findings (t test between data and model prediction, decision bound: t (12) ϭ 2.8, p ϭ 0.01; residual time constant: t (12) ϭ 2.9, p ϭ 0.01).</s><s>Changes in accumulation rate k elicited results that were consistent with our results (t (12) ϭ 0.2, p Ͼ 0.5).</s><s>Together, these analyses confirm that only an increased accumulation rate can explain the observed effect of temporal expectation on the speed and accuracy of perceptual decisions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the present study, we have shown that temporal expectation can modulate the perception of relevant events by an increase of signal contrast.</s><s>Importantly, we found that this increase in the psychophysical sensitivity was accompanied by a reduction in reaction times.</s><s>A simple diffusion model indicated that temporal expectation changed the signal-to-noise gain of the sensory evidence upon which decisions were made.</s><s>Together, our findings support the idea that the entrainment of attentional focus to the temporal structure of external events acts as a central mechanism for the perceptual modulation of relevant sensory information.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have also suggested that temporal expectation can improve the detection and discrimination of visual targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lasley and Cohn, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Westheimer and Ley, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Correa et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mathewson et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>While very important, the design or stimulus parameters of these studies limit their interpretation.</s><s>Early psychophysical studies manipulating temporal certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lasley and Cohn, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Westheimer and Ley, 1996)</ref> used other stimuli as temporal markers and did not isolate temporal expectation from temporal order or control for foreperiod effects.</s><s>More recent studies showing facilitation of dЈ in temporal expectation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Correa et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mathewson et al., 2010)</ref> used target stimuli defined by one single set of physical parameters, so that it was not possible to test whether and how the signalto-noise contrast was affected.</s><s>Changes in dЈ are suggestive of perceptual mechanisms occurring in early sensory cortices, but are also compatible with postperceptual mechanisms, such as better pooling of early sensory responses by higher-level regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Pestilli et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>By parametrically varying the contrast levels in our task, we derived the effect of temporal expectation on the full psychometric curve.</s><s>Results revealed an enhancement in perceptual processing via a contrast gain, suggesting that temporal expectation can affect visual perception by increase the quality of sensory representation.</s></p><p><s>The output of our diffusion model gives further support to this view.</s><s>An increase in the normalized accumulation rate k, as found for the effect of temporal expectation on decision making, sets a strong constraint on the type of process that can be influenced by temporal expectation in our task.</s><s>The observed leftward shift of the psychometric function corresponds to a contrast gain-suggesting that temporal expectations act by increasing the effective contrast of the signal, as if the signal was of higher contrast when embedded in a rhythmic stream of stimuli.</s><s>The alternative explanation that temporal expectations would act by reducing the amount of decision noise does not predict the observed reduction of reaction times.</s><s>Also, the effect has to occur in signal-selective visual areas because it corresponds of a selective enhancement of the signal component, not an unselective enhancement of both signal and noise, which would not affect the signal-to-noise accumulation rate k.</s></p><p><s>In this study, temporal expectation was manipulated by varying the regularity of the rhythmic streams in which targets were presented.</s><s>Recently, it has been proposed that the entrainment of attention to rhythmic events is a fundamental mechanism of sensory selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lakatos et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jones, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In our study, both behavioral data and modeling indicated that perceptual sensitivity to targets was enhanced when the streams were presented rhythmically, supporting the idea that attention can become entrained to external events to enhance perceptual processing.</s></p><p><s>We are currently investigating the neural mechanisms supporting perceptual facilitation by rhythmic temporal expectation.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Schroeder and colleagues (2010)</ref> recently proposed a neural mechanism by which low-frequency oscillatory activity in early perceptual areas becomes entrained to the rhythmic input so that task-relevant events are more likely to occur at time points in which the state of excitability of sensory areas is optimal.</s><s>It is possible that temporal expectation also affects active visualsensing mechanisms.</s><s>Recently, the frequency and direction of small fixational eye movements (i.e., microsaccades) have been associated with fluctuations in performance in perception and attention tasks (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Martinez-Conde et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It will be interesting to investigate whether temporal expectation modulates the occurrence of microsaccades.</s><s>Future studies using appropriate visual stimulation and sensitive eye monitoring will be required to address this important question.</s></p><p><s>Neurophysiological studies in humans have shown that temporal expectation alone can be insufficient to modulate early visual processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Doherty et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Correa and Nobre, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rohenkohl and Nobre, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Instead, temporal expectation boosts the effect of spatial attention on early visual potentials.</s><s>These findings led to the hypothesis that temporal expectation influences early visual processing primarily by timing neurons with other relevant receptive field properties (such as spatial location or stimulus feature) (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nobre et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>According to this view, temporal information can be used to tune anticipatory activity in neuronal assemblies that are coding other relevant information about the input.</s><s>In our study, spatial location was always fixed, allowing an association between temporal and spatial expectations, which led to a behavioral an enhancement on signal sensitivity.</s><s>However, future studies are necessary to investigate whether temporal expectation alone can still facilitate the perceptual processing of relevant events.</s></p><p><s>We believe that temporal expectations can influence neural processing in a highly flexible manner, controlling local excitability of selected neural populations already engaged by other task attributes.</s><s>Therefore, the stage of information processing that can be affected by temporal expectations could be greatly dependent on task goals.</s><s>Finally, our results provide evidence for the behavioral consequences of findings that have been reported by neurophysiological studies, indicating that temporal expectation can boost the perception of relevant events by modulating early stages of visual processing.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
