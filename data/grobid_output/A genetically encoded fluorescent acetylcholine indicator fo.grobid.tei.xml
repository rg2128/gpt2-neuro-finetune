<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Acetylcholine (ACh), the first identified neurotransmitter, mediates cell-to-cell communication in the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as non-neuronal systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> .</s><s>Cholinergic projection neurons within the mammalian brain primarily originate in three major nuclei, including the basal forebrain (BF), the brainstem pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei.</s><s>Cholinergic neurons within these groups project widely throughout the cortical and subcortical domains, consistent with their involvement in complex brain functions, including attention, perception, associative learning and sleep/ awake balancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</s><s>Additional smaller populations of cholinergic neurons scatter throughout other brain areas (e.g., the medial habenula (MHb) and the striatum), contributing to behaviors related to motion, motivation and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Dysregulation of central cholinergic transmission is linked to a number of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, addiction, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>In the peripheral nervous and non-nervous systems, ACh is released by both neurons and non-neuronal cells to relay fast transmission at neuromuscular junctions and to regulate functions of a variety of other tissues and organs, including the heart, liver and pancreas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> .</s><s>Dysregulation of peripheral and non-neuronal cholinergic signals is associated with multiple pathological states, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immune deficiency and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Despite the significance of ACh signals in many fundamental aspects of our physiology, cholinergic transmission in the majority of tissues and organs remains poorly understood, due primarily to the limitations of tools available for the direct measurement of ACh <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Microdialysis, an established method for monitoring extracellular ACh <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , is less frequently used because of its poor spatial and temporal resolution.</s><s>Patch-clamp recordings have excellent sensitivity and temporal resolution, but the approach is limited by the number of cells that can be recorded simultaneously and the prominent desensitization of cholinergic currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, ACh amperometry has millisecond temporal resolution, yet its technically challenging enzymatic coating procedure limits its stability and reproducibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>While the TANGO assay has unparalleled sensitivity, the time-consuming transcriptional and translational amplification processes prevent its use for real-time ACh measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Recently developed FRET sensors and cell-based fluorescent sensors (CNiFERs) for ACh have attractive real-time imaging features, but they are limited by either the low sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> or the dependence on invasive cell transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>These fluorescent sensors, nevertheless, inspired us to engineer more user-friendly and broadly applicable genetically-encoded ACh sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Here, we report a family of genetically-encoded G-protein-coupled receptor activation-based sensors for ACh (GACh).</s><s>Our GACh sensors were initially constructed by coupling a circular permutated green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) into a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (MR), with subsequent improvements via large-scale site-directed mutagenesis and screening.</s><s>The sensitivity and utility of GACh sensors were validated in cultured HEK293T cells, in cultured cortical neurons, in tissue slices prepared from multiple brain regions and peripheral organs, in the olfactory system of living Drosophila and in the visual cortex of awake behaving mice in vivo.</s><s>Our data indicate that GACh sensors have the sensitivity (EC 50 ≈ 1 μM), specificity (comparable to endogenous MRs), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR ≈ 14), kinetics (τ on/off ≈ 200-800 ms) and photostability (≥1-4 hrs) suitable for precise and convenient real-time assays of ACh signals.</s></p></div>
