<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activation of an ORN inhibits its neighbor</head><p><s>To analyze the relationship between two ORNs in a sensillum, we used a paradigm that allows us to deliver two odors, one for each neuron (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>One odorant, the "background odorant", is provided continuously via an airstream and elicits the sustained firing of one ORN, the A neuron in most experiments.</s><s>Superimposed upon this background stimulus, a short pulse of a second odorant is delivered to activate the other ORN, usually the B neuron.</s><s>This paradigm of odor presentation is distinct from the single-odorant paradigm used commonly in many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , but it simulates a coding problem that the system encounters in its natural environment, for example when a fly receiving sustained olfactory input from a local source receives a superimposed, transient stimulus from a distant source delivered by a gust of wind.</s></p><p><s>When the ab3 sensillum is stimulated with a prolonged dose of methyl hexanoate (m-hex), the ab3A neuron responds with a sustained train of action potentials (large action potentials in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>When a pulse of 2-heptanone is superimposed on this background, not only does ab3B fire (small action potentials) but there is a dramatic reduction in the firing of ab3A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>This inhibitory effect could in principle be due to direct inhibition of Or22a, the receptor of ab3A, by 2-heptanone.</s><s>However, ablation of ab3B by expression of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) completely abolished the inhibition of ab3A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, bottom).</s><s>This result suggests that the inhibition of the A neuron depends on the excitation of the B neuron.</s></p><p><s>To test further the possibility that activation of the ab3B neuron can inhibit the ab3A neuron, we expressed Channelrhodopsin2 (H134R-ChR2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> in ab3B.</s><s>As expected, blue light elicited an excitatory response in ab3B of these engineered flies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>).</s><s>Activation of ab3B by light also inhibited the tonic firing of ab3A elicited by methyl hexanoate.</s><s>Blue light had no effect on ab3A firing in control flies lacking H134R-ChR2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>, bottom), indicating that it does not inhibit ab3A directly.</s><s>The simplest interpretation of these results is that activation of ab3B inhibits the firing of ab3A.</s></p><p><s>We next asked whether activation of ab3A can inhibit ab3B.</s><s>We first elevated ab3B activity by delivering 2-heptanone as the background odorant and then presented a pulse of methyl hexanoate to activate ab3A.</s><s>Indeed, the pulse of methyl hexanoate inhibited the activity of ab3B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>, top).</s><s>Genetic ablation of ab3A demonstrated that this inhibition depended on ab3A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>, bottom).</s><s>Similarly, when H134R-ChR2 was expressed in ab3A, a blue-light stimulus activated ab3A and inhibited the tonic firing of ab3B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lateral inhibition in other sensilla</head><p><s>There are four morphological types of antennal sensilla: large basiconic sensilla, small basiconic sensilla, coeloconic sensilla, and trichoid sensilla <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>ab3 is a large basiconic sensillum containing two ORNs.</s><s>We analyzed four other sensilla, chosen for their morphological diversity and their functional specificities.</s><s>Their ORNs express receptors that have been functionally characterized, and odorants have been identified that at certain concentrations selectively activate the receptor of only one ORN in each sensillum <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Lateral inhibition between ORNs was observed in all sensillar types examined: a large basiconic sensillum containing four ORNs (ab1), a large basiconic sensillum with two ORNs (ab2), a small basiconic sensillum (ab5), and a coeloconic sensillum (ac3).</s><s>In each case, a short odorant pulse that activated one target ORN inhibited the tonic firing of a neighboring ORN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-d</ref>).</s><s>When the targeted ORN was ablated or nonfunctional, the short odorant pulse showed no inhibition of the neighboring ORN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>We note also that the pulsed odorant alone did not directly inhibit the spontaneous firing of the A neuron (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>These results indicate that lateral inhibition is observed broadly in the Drosophila antenna.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lateral inhibition in a mosquito sensillum</head><p><s>ORNs are compartmentalized in sensilla in a wide variety of insects.</s><s>We examined a sensillum of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae that responds to CO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , a human volatile that attracts many mosquito species <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>This sensillum contains an ORN, cpA, that responds to CO 2 , and a neighboring ORN, cpB, that is excited by 1-octen-3-ol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We used a prolonged CO 2 stimulus to elicit a sustained response from cpA.</s><s>When a short pulse of 1-octen-3-ol was superimposed, the cpB neuron was excited and cpA was robustly inhibited (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>We note that when 1-octen-3-ol was delivered in the absence of CO 2 , it did not inhibit the spontaneous firing of the CO 2 -responsive cpA neuron directly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2d</ref>), consistent with previous results <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our results show that lateral inhibition occurs in olfactory sensilla of multiple insect species, in sensilla of radically different morphology, and in sensilla containing two, three or four ORNs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibition is dose-dependent</head><p><s>When ab3A was tonically excited with a constant concentration of methyl hexanoate, increasing doses of 2-heptanone produced increasing excitation of ab3B and increasing inhibition of ab3A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>When the scales of the firing ranges are adjusted (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), the dose-response functions appear symmetric.</s></p><p><s>When the background odorant, methyl hexanoate, was delivered at increasing concentrations, the rate of ab3A tonic firing increased across a range of ~15 spikes/s to ~50 spikes/s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, and Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>Inhibition by a strong ab3B stimulus was potent across all these concentrations; in all of these cases the rate of firing was reduced to approximately the same level.</s><s>A genetic ablation experiment confirmed that these reductions depended on ab3B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>We note that 2-heptanone alone did not directly inhibit ab3A spontaneous activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, no bkg).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transmission without a synapse</head><p><s>Next we asked whether the intrasensillar communication is mediated by synapses.</s><s>First we used tetanus toxin (TNT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> to block synaptic transmission.</s><s>We expressed TNT in ORNs using the Orco promoter and the GAL4-UAS system, which is expected to drive expression in all basiconic ORNs 29 except the CO 2 -sensitive ab1C neuron <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Activation of ab3B inhibited the tonic excitation of ab3A in these TNT-expressing flies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, top).</s><s>Moreover, the degree of inhibition was comparable to that in control flies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, bottom).</s><s>T-maze behavioral tests confirmed that synaptic transmission was blocked in the targeted ORNs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Second, we performed single-unit recordings from isolated antennae, severed from the heads of flies.</s><s>Activation of ab3B again inhibited the tonic excitation of ab3A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>), supporting the conclusion that lateral inhibition between neighboring ORNs occurs in the periphery without involvement of central synapses.</s></p><p><s>Third, we tested the possibility of axo-axonic synapses between ORNs with a crosscorrelation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Analysis of ab3A and ab3B spontaneous spikes did not reveal coordinated spiking patterns and thus provided no evidence for axo-axonic synaptic interactions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>), similar to what has been found between homotypic ORNs in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Finally, we used Cd 2+ to block synaptic neurotransmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>We included a high concentration of Cd 2+ in the recording pipette so as to allow Cd 2+ to diffuse into the sensillum lymph and block any peripheral dendro-dendritic synapses in sensilla of Orco-GAL4; UAS-TNT flies.</s><s>We observed little if any effect on the inhibition of ab3A firing following ab3B excitation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>; compare with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>To verify the efficacy of our drug delivery method, we applied the Orco agonist VUAA1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> via the recording pipette and observed elevated ORN spike activities as expected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results indicate that lateral inhibition does not depend on chemical synapses.</s></p><p><s>Intrasensillar communication could in principle be mediated via gap junctions; however, the activation of one ORN would then likely lead to the activation, rather than the inhibition, of its neighbor.</s><s>Moreover, we found that nitric oxide signaling inhibitors had no effect on lateral inhibition (not shown).</s><s>In summary, conventional forms of neuronal communication are unlikely to mediate lateral inhibition in a sensillum.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lateral inhibition modulates behavior</head><p><s>To determine whether intra-sensillar neuronal inhibition can modulate olfactory behavior, we examined a pair of neighboring ORNs whose activation leads to opposing behavioral outputs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>ab1A mediates attraction to apple cider vinegar (ACV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , whereas its neighbor ab1C mediates aversion to low concentrations of CO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>We confirmed that in a T-maze assay, when given a choice between CO 2 and air alone, flies avoid CO 2 , whereas when faced with a choice between ACV and water, they are attracted to ACV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>, black bars).</s></p><p><s>We then tested whether the two behavioral pathways interact.</s><s>When both arms of the Tmaze contained CO 2 , the flies showed no preference (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>When ACV was added to one of the CO 2 -containing arms, the flies preferred that arm.</s><s>The preference for the arm containing both CO 2 and ACV could have two sources: the attraction to its ACV that is mediated by ab1A, and a reduction in the avoidance of its CO 2 that is mediated by ab1C.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate the contributions of these sources, we used Orco-GAL4;UAS-TNT, which blocks synaptic transmission from ab1A but not ab1C.</s><s>Consistent with the expected specificity of this block, these flies did not respond to ACV but avoided CO 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>, black bars).</s><s>We note that in these flies, physiological recordings confirmed that ab1A neurons respond to ACV (not shown).</s><s>When given a choice between two arms, one with CO 2 and one with CO 2 and ACV, these flies preferred the arm with ACV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>Since synaptic transmission from ab1A neurons is blocked and the flies have no attraction to ACV, the simplest interpretation of these results is that activation of ab1A attenuated the response of ab1C to CO 2 via lateral inhibition: the reduced CO 2 response decreased the avoidance of the arm containing CO 2 and ACV relative to the arm containing CO 2 alone, and this decreased avoidance is seen as an attraction to the arm containing CO 2 and ACV.</s></p><p><s>If this interpretation is correct, and the preference for the arm containing CO 2 and ACV depends on the activation of ab1A, then the preference should be abolished in Orco mutants, which lack a co-receptor required for the response of ab1A but not ab1C.</s><s>Consistent with this prediction, Orco mutants showed no preference between the arm containing CO 2 and the arm containing CO 2 and ACV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>We note that ACV does not inhibit ab1C directly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results provide evidence that lateral inhibition within a sensillum can modulate behavior.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Integration of olfactory information has long been known to occur in the CNS, and has more recently been shown to occur in individual ORNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>We have demonstrated that integration also occurs at a third level, the sensillum, via lateral inhibition between ORNs responding to different components of a mixture.</s><s>The sensillum thus acts as a processing unit in olfactory computation.</s></p><p><s>Lateral inhibition of a prolonged signal by a transient signal may provide a neural representation of the salience of an odor that has recently reached the fly <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Sustained responses were inhibited more strongly by stronger transient pulses.</s><s>This graded pattern of lateral inhibition may give rise to a potent form of contrast enhancement in which the output of a sensillum is dominated by a pulse of a strong odor.</s><s>Graded lateral inhibition may provide a peripheral mechanism for evaluating countervailing signals and allowing one to prevail.</s><s>We note that in Drosophila, an ORN that responds to a pheromone <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> is the only ORN that does not have a neighbor, as if to ensure that its sustained response is not inhibited by a pulse of any other odorant.</s></p><p><s>Our finding that lateral inhibition does not require synapses is consistent with anatomical data.</s><s>Electron microscopy in Drosophila has not revealed synaptic structures or gap junctions between ORNs housed in the same sensillum <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Rather, as detailed below, the physiological features of olfactory sensilla suggest another mechanism of lateral information flow: ephaptic transmission, which refers to non-synaptic communication between adjacent neurons through an extracellular electrical field <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>The ability of either neuron in a twoneuron sensillum to inhibit the other, as well as the grossly similar temporal dynamics of activation and lateral inhibition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>), are consistent with ephaptic transmission.</s></p><p><s>In insect olfactory sensilla, a substantial electrical potential exists between two isolated compartments: the sensillum lymph, which bathes the dendrites, and the hemolymph, which surrounds the somata (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>This "transepithelial" potential serves as the primary driving force for odorant-induced transduction currents of the ORNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Elaboration of an established electrical circuit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> based on these physiological features predicts that strong activation of one ORN will hyperpolarize the soma of a co-compartmentalized ORN (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>), resulting in a reduced firing rate.</s><s>This prediction is consistent with the results of our molecular genetic analysis and with our interpretation that lateral inhibition is due to ephaptic interactions.</s></p><p><s>The model further predicts that the magnitude of the hyperpolarization of the neighboring neuron, and hence its reduction in firing rate, is reflected by the change in the transepithelial potential (V A ) (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>), measured experimentally as a local field potential (LFP) (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Although strong activation of an ORN can influence the LFP in a neighboring sensillum <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> , we found that the magnitude of the LFP change in nearby unstimulated sensilla is small (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with this observation, lateral inhibition does not spread among homotypic sensilla that are in close proximity to one another (Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>These results further support the conclusion that the lateral inhibition is due to local electrical interactions between neighboring ORNs within a sensillum.</s></p><p><s>The two-odor paradigm used in this analysis, in which a transient odor is superimposed upon a sustained odor, differs from the classic one-odor paradigm in which a transient pulse of a single odor is delivered.</s><s>A priori one might expect to observe ephaptic effects in the oneodor paradigm if one ORN were excited sufficiently strongly, but the effects may be expected to be less pronounced than in the two-odor paradigm.</s><s>ORN spike frequency is determined not only by the somatic transmembrane potential V m , but also by its rate of change, dV m /dt <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>According to the model, transient activation of ORN 2 reduces the depolarizing current of ORN 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>In the two-odor paradigm, activation of ORN 2 has a dramatic effect on the value of dV m1 /dt, which changes from 0 to a negative value (dV m1 /dt &lt;&lt;0; Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, in the one-odor paradigm, the activation of ORN 2 has a more subtle effect on dV m1 /dt when the sensillum is stimulated with an odor that activates both neurons: dV m1 /dt is positive either in the presence or absence of ORN 2 activation, only somewhat less positive when ORN 2 is activated.</s><s>The more subtle influence of ORN 2 activation on dV m1 /dt in the one-odor paradigm may explain why in the one-odor paradigm, the excitatory responses of an ORN containing an ectopically expressed receptor were strikingly similar to those of the ORN that endogenously expresses the same receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , despite major differences in the response profiles of their neighbors.</s></p><p><s>We note finally that our results
