<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kir4.1 is upregulated in LHb of animal models of depression</head><p><s>In an unbiased, high-throughput, quantitative proteomic screening to compare habenular protein expression of congenitally learned helpless (cLH) rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and wild-type SD rats, we identified Kir4.1 to be highly upregulated in the LHb of cLH rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> (1.69-fold of wild-type control, p = 0.02, Student's t-test, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1a</ref>).</s><s>Western blot analysis confirmed that Kir4.1 had a significant increase (1.44-fold, p = 0.009, Paired t-test) in the membrane protein extraction of cLH habenulae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, another astrocyte-specific protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), did not show any change in expression (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1a</ref>), indicating there was no astrogliosis.</s></p><p><s>To test whether Kir4.1 upregulation is universal in depression, we examined an additional rat model of depression, the LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>One week of LPS injection (0.5mg/kg, i.p.) in 3-month-old Wistar rats was sufficient to cause strong depressive-like phenotype in the forced swim test (FST, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and sucrose preference test (SPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>The Kir4.1 level was also significantly increased in the LPS-induced rats (1.87-fold, p &lt; 0.0001, Paired t-test, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1c</ref>).</s><s>Quantitative real-time PCR revealed an increase (1.2-fold, p = 0.015, Paired t-test) of Kir4.1 mRNA level in cLH habenulae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1d</ref>), suggesting that at least part of the protein level change is due to transcriptional upregulation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-dependent increase of LHb astrocytic Kir4.1 current and depression onset in cLH rats</head><p><s>Kir4.1 is a principal component of the glial Kir channel and is largely responsible for mediating the K+ conductance and setting the resting membrane potential (RMP) of astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>To confirm that Kir4.1 function is indeed upregulated, we performed whole-cell patch clamp onto the astrocytes in brain slices made from the LHb of cLH or SD rats.</s></p><p><s>Astrocytes were distinguished from neurons by their small (5-10 µm) oval shaped somata and electrophysiological features including a relatively hyperpolarized RMP (-74 ± 1 mV), a low input resistance Rin (47 ± 6 MΩ), a linear I-V relationship and an absence of action potentials in response to depolarizing current injections (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">2a-d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Biocytin filling and absence of NeuN co-staining confirmed that cells fitting the above criteria were indeed astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>We then bath applied Ba 2+ (BaCl 2 , 100 µM), which selectively blocks Kir channels at sub-mM concentrations, to isolate Kir4.1 current <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>The Ba 2+ -sensitive current displayed a reversal potential close to Ek (-90mV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), indicating that it represents the K+ conductance.</s><s>We found that Ba 2+ -sensitive currents in LHb astrocytes were almost doubled in cLH rats (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1e</ref>), as well as in LPS-treated rats (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">2f</ref>), at the age of P60-90.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the increase of Kir4.1 current and protein level was not obvious at P30 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1f</ref>, Extended data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1b</ref>).</s><s>At this age, cLH rats did not yet show depressive-like phenotypes in both the FST (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1g</ref>) and learned helpless test (LHT, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1h</ref>), suggesting that the upregulation of Kir4.1 level is concomitant with the developmental onset of the depressivelike symptoms.</s></p></div>
