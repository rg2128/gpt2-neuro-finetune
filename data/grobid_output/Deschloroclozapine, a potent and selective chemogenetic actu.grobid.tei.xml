<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The chemogenetic technology Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) affords remotely reversible control of cellular signaling, neuronal activity and behavior.</s><s>Although the combination of muscarinic-based DREADDs with clozapine-Noxide (CNO) has been widely used, sluggish kinetics, metabolic liabilities, and potential offtarget effects of CNO represent areas for improvement.</s><s>Here we provide a new high affinity and selective agonist deschloroclozapine (DCZ) for muscarinic-based DREADDs.</s><s>Positron emission tomography revealed that DCZ selectively bound to and occupied DREADDs in both mice and monkeys.</s><s>Systemic delivery of low doses of DCZ (1 or 3 μg/kg) enhanced neuronal activity via hM3Dq within minutes in mice and monkeys.</s><s>Intramuscular injections of DCZ (100 μg/kg) reversibly induced spatial working memory deficits in monkeys expressing hM4Di in the prefrontal cortex.</s><s>DCZ represents the most potent, selective, metabolically stable and fast-acting DREADD agonist reported with utility in both mice and non-human primates for a variety of applications.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here, we report that the new DREADD agonist DCZ represents an extremely potent, highly brain-penetrant, and selective actuator for hM3Dqand hM4Di-DREADDs in both mice and monkeys.</s><s>The properties of DCZ described here demonstrate that it can be adopted as a preferred, fast-acting chemogenetic actuator with minimal off-target actions, thereby enhancing opportunities for investigating the causal link between neuronal activity and behavior with high translational potential.</s></p><p><s>Several features of DCZ indicate its superiority as a chemogenetic actuator over prior agonists.</s><s>First, DCZ exhibits DREADD-selective binding both in vitro and in vivo.</s></p><p><s>Radioligand binding assays demonstrated that DCZ is selective for hM3Dq and hM4Di.</s><s>PET imaging demonstrated that DCZ has substantially improved the selectivity compared with clozapine; DCZ has decreased off-target binding, while it retains similar potency at muscarinic DREADDs as clozapine.</s><s>Second, DCZ exhibits good brain concentration profiles and biostability.</s><s>PET imaging revealed that systemically administered DCZ occupied hM4Di-DREADDs with a similar occupancy to CNO or C21 at ~20-or 60-fold smaller doses, respectively.</s><s>Pharmacokinetic studies confirmed that DCZ is rapidly accumulated in mouse brains and monkey CSF, while its metabolites are negligible.</s><s>Third, DCZ has high potency for muscarinic DREADDs.</s><s>In vitro assays revealed that hM3Dq could be activated by substantially lower concentrations of DCZ, as compared to CNO and C21.</s></p><p><s>DCZ did not display significant agonist potencies for any of the 318 off-target GPCRs tested; binding assays at a number of GPCRs, channels and transporters screened by the National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program showed that DCZ has modest affinity (55 -87 nM) for a few GPCRs, low affinity (100-1,000 nM) for several GPCRs and minimal activity (&gt;1,000 nM) at most CNS targets tested.</s><s>In short, DCZ has a higher selectivity for DREADDs than clozapine and is capable of occupying and activating DREADDs at a lower dose than CNO and C21, thus offering a greater effective window than the prior DREADD ligands.</s></p><p><s>CNO has repeatedly been shown to have relatively slow kinetics for neuronal activation via hM3Dq; following systemic administration, increases in activity began at around 5-10 min and reached a maximum at 45 min or later <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Because bath application of CNO immediately increased the firing rate of hM3Dq-expressing neurons in slice preparations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , the relatively slow activation appears to reflect the slow kinetics of CNO uptake in the brain.</s><s>Moreover, the major effects on DREADDs may be exerted by its metabolite clozapine, rather than CNO itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , where the metabolism is significant in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and in monkeys with slower delivery (e.g., subcutaneous injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> ).</s><s>Although the concentration of metabolized clozapine is minimal in monkeys with rapid intravenous delivery of CNO <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , the brain uptake of CNO is considerably low (cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1i</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, DCZ quickly penetrates into the brain and induces a rapid onset of excitability of hM3Dq-positive neuronal populations, as demonstrated by two-photon calcium imaging in mice and by electrophysiological recording in monkeys (cf.</s><s>Figs. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Thus, DCZ combined with muscarinic-based DREADDs provides a superior platform for examining the effects of rapid and sustainable chemogenetic neuronal modulation.</s><s>For example, single-unit or in vivo patch-clamp recording studies, where long-term (30-60 min) maintenance is technically demanding, would greatly benefit from the rapid action of the DCZ-DREADD system.</s><s>Such a rapid chemogenetic action would also be valuable for future therapeutic applications, for instance, on-demand seizure attenuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The present results indicate that DCZ can also be utilized for in vivo neuronal silencing by activating hM4Di, an inhibitory DREADD.</s><s>Our data suggest that a reasonable upper limit of DCZ dose is 100 μg/kg (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>), which allows a sufficient concentration of DCZ available for hM4Di-DREADD binding in vivo for at least 2 h in monkeys.</s><s>Indeed, a 100 μg/kg dose of DCZ rapidly (&lt;10 min) and reversibly induced spatial working memory deficits in monkeys expressing hM4Di in the PFC (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Given the high agonist potency of DCZ (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>), smaller DCZ doses would induce similar or detectable behavioral deficits.</s><s>With its high selectivity and potency, DCZ will provide potential orthogonality of the muscarinic DREADDs to other classes of chemogenetic tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , providing opportunity for a multiplexed/bimodal control of physiological systems.</s><s>Moreover, in combination with lowinvasive targeted gene delivery methods such as ultrasonic BBB opening <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , DCZ may open the potential for targeted, minimally invasive, and side-effect-free brain theranostics.</s></p><p><s>One of the technical difficulties in chemogenetic manipulations, especially for large animals, is the delivery of transgene specifically into a target neuronal population as well as the accomplishment of stable transgene expression throughout the experimental period.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have shown that PET imaging with [ 11 C]clozapine or [ 11 C]CNO can visualize hM4Di expression in living mice and monkeys, providing effective tools for noninvasive monitoring of gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>However, because these ligands display poor DREADD selectivity or brain permeability, the application of DREADD-PET in monkeys was limited to visualization of hM4Di expression in the striatum.</s><s>The present study has demonstrated that [ 11 C]DCZ is an exceedingly useful PET ligand for visualizing both hM3Dq and hM4Di expression in cortical and subcortical areas of mice and monkeys, with improved specificity compared with [ 11 C]clozapine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The monitoring of transgene expression is beneficial for long-term behavioral studies and is of great advantage for conducting successful experiments (cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>In addition to expression monitoring, PET imaging has allowed the elucidation of a relationship between a pharmacologically effective dose of DREADD agonists and DREADD occupancy in vivo (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, it has also been demonstrated in our study that [ 11 C]DCZ-PET enables us to visualize DREADDs expression at axon terminal sites (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), providing a powerful means for mapping projection areas for pathway-selective activity manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , which can be induced by local infusion of DREADD agonist; DCZ may be suitable because of its high selectivity and efficacy.</s></p><p><s>Although PET imaging data have implied that DCZ has off-target binding in cortical areas possibly to endogenous receptors with low affinities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1g</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), the agonist potency of DCZ at DREADDs is in the sub-nM range and, therefore, when used at a sufficient dose, occupancy on off-targets (~50 nM or higher) can be predicted to be minimal.</s><s>Indeed, our data further suggest that systemic administration of DCZ at 100 μg/kg or smaller doses would not induce discernible off-target effects on neuronal activity or behavior in monkeys not expressing the muscarinic-based DREADDs (cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Since the variability of CSF concentration across subjects and the amount of metabolites for DCZ were much smaller than those for CNO (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , the potential baseline sensitivity to DCZ would be minimal.</s><s>Therefore, DCZ provides a clear advantage over prior agonists due to increasing reliability by minimizing concerns about potential off-target effects.</s><s>However, we cannot completely rule out unanticipated off-target effects because it is impossible to measure the activity of DCZ against every potential endogenous target.</s><s>Therefore, as with all other neuromodulation technologies, control experiments-here using non-DREADD animals-are recommended.</s><s>In mice, control experiments are essential since the current study did not examine an off-target action of DCZ at a high dose where C21, a DCZ metabolite, was detected at very low concentrations in CSF (&lt;0.2 nM; Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>).</s><s>Future studies will be required to determine appropriate DCZ doses and the effective time window for mouse chemogenetic experiments.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the characteristics of DCZ described here-its high selectivity, high brainpenetrability, and biostability-facilitate the rapid and selective modulation of neuronal activity and behavior with muscarinic-based DREADDs in living animals.</s><s>Given the potential drawbacks of prior DREADD agonists, DCZ will provide clear benefits for many users of muscarinic DREADDs, with increasing reliability by removing concerns about potential off-target responses.</s><s>In mice, the animals were anesthetized with a mixture of air, oxygen, and isoflurane (3-5% for induction and 2% for
