<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We characterized a specific population of PG cells that mediates lateral inhibition between olfactory bulb principal neurons projecting into the same glomerulus.</s><s>This intraglomerular inhibitory pathway is recruited by even the weakest ON input and shapes the spike output of mitral and tufted cells.</s><s>Moreover, in vivo recordings show that intraglomerular lateral inhibition is activated at each respiration cycle.</s></p><p><s>We took advantage of a transgenic mouse expressing EYFP in a subset of PG cells to characterize the properties of an intraglomerular inhibitory circuit that modulates the spike output of principal neurons.</s><s>EYFP ϩ PG cells include, although not exclusively, cells expressing CB but does not overlap with the two other well identified populations of PG cells immunoreactive for CR and TH.</s><s>Electron microscopy studies of CB ϩ PG cells have shown that they receive synapses from mitral/tufted cells but rarely from OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Toida et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kosaka and Kosaka, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Panzanelli et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, ultrastructural evidence suggests that CB ϩ PG cells do not have an axon and release their neurotransmitter from dendrites within their glomerulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kosaka and Kosaka, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Our functional and morphological characterization of EYFP ϩ PG cells is consistent with these data.</s><s>We have demonstrated that mitral, tufted, and ET cells make excitatory synapses on EYFP ϩ PG cells.</s><s>Thus, EYFP ϩ PG cells responded to a stimulation of OSNs with a short barrage of EPSCs that lasted only few tens of milliseconds.</s><s>Similar responses were observed in a subgroup of EYFP Ϫ PG cells, suggesting that EYFP ϩ PG cells, although they constitute 30% of PG cells, might be representative of an even larger group of type 2 PG cells with similar excitatory connections.</s><s>The transient nature of this response, which contrasts with the long-lasting responses observed in other PG cells, was remarkably consistent despite the diversity of immunohistochemical profiles and membrane properties among EYFP ϩ PG cells.</s><s>The onset latency of the response was quite fast (ϳ3 ms) yet longer and more variable than in ET or PG cells connected directly to OSNs, suggesting that EYFP ϩ PG cells do not receive direct inputs from OSNs.</s><s>This fast-onset polysynaptic activation likely relies on ET cells that fire as early as 2 ms after the stimulation of OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Saint Jan et al., 2009)</ref> and elicit an EPSC in EYFP ϩ PG cells in ϳ1 ms.</s></p><p><s>Some PG cells are activated by weak ON inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gire and Schoppa, 2009)</ref> or the firing of a single principal cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Murphy et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Current models suggest that low-threshold intraglomerular inhibition may serve as a gatekeeper that shunts weak ON inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gire and Schoppa, 2009)</ref> and may separate the firing phase of the two output channels (tufted vs mitral cells) along a respiration cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fukunaga et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Our results show that EYFP ϩ PG cells constitute a large fraction of these highly excitable PG cells that also include a minority of EYFP Ϫ PG cells.</s><s>We have demonstrated that they mediate a form of lateral inhibition, the firing of a single principal neuron producing disynaptic inhibition of other mitral and tufted cells within the same glomerulus.</s><s>This recurrent pathway is recruited by even the weakest ON input and mediates ON-evoked inhibition of principal neurons.</s><s>We also found that EYFP ϩ PG cells indiscriminately release GABA onto mitral, tufted, and ET cells and that ON-evoked intraglomerular inhibition has a similar time course in these three types of neurons.</s><s>Our experimental results do not support a re-cent study that stated that, unlike mitral cells, tufted cells are not, or are less, modulated by intraglomerular inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fukunaga et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, that study relied on a theoretical network model based on experimentally undemonstrated differences in PG cell inputs on mitral and tufted cells.</s><s>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burton and Urban (2014)</ref> suggested that the different firing phases of mitral and tufted cells may be attributable to a greater intrinsic excitability and a stronger afferent-evoked excitation in tufted cells.</s></p><p><s>Evaluating the contribution of EYFP ϩ PG cells in ON-evoked inhibition would require their selective manipulation, for instance, with optogenetics.</s><s>However, to date, there is no selective marker for this population, which impedes its genetic manipulation.</s><s>Nevertheless, our data suggest that only a minority of PG cells have a similar activation threshold than EYFP ϩ PG cells and potentially contribute to ON-evoked inhibition.</s><s>Moreover, we show that half of CR ϩ PG cells are not, or are only weakly, activated by ON inputs and thus unlikely to participate.</s><s>However, ON-evoked inhibition lasts longer than the firing of EYFP ϩ PG cells, suggesting that other PG cell subtypes that respond to an ON input with a longer firing may generate late IPSCs.</s><s>Do granule or PV ϩ cells also contribute to the early phase of ON-evoked inhibition?</s><s>Several results argue against this idea.</s><s>As shown previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Shao et al., 2012)</ref>, early IPSCs persisted in the presence of NMDA receptor blockers that limit the activation of granule cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schoppa et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Second, ON-evoked inhibition was abolished by intraglomerular perfusion of GBZ, suggesting that PV ϩ and granule cells that do not make synapses within the glomerulus do not contribute.</s><s>Consistent with this conclusion, the time course of ON-evoked inhibition was similar in ET cells that presumably do not interact with granule cells and PV ϩ interneurons.</s><s>This indicates that intraglomerular pathways are sufficient to produce a strong inhibition.</s></p><p><s>Finally, granule cells respond to a glomerular stimulation with an ϳ70 ms delayed firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schoppa and Westbrook, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kapoor and Urban, 2006)</ref> that does not match with the early onset of OSN-evoked inhibition (ϳ6 ms).</s></p><p><s>The short timescale of EYFP ϩ PG cell-mediated intraglomerular inhibition in slices (ϳ100 ms) is physiologically relevant for odor processing.</s><s>In vivo, spontaneous firing and odor-evoked discharges of mitral and tufted cells are often constrained by the ϳ2-10 Hz respiratory rhythm.</s><s>Thus, mitral and tufted cells fire action potentials during a brief (50 -150 ms) phase of the respiration cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cang and Isaacson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Margrie and Schaefer, 2003;</ref><ref

2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Margrie and Schaefer, 2003)</ref>, rhythmic depolarizations locked to the respiration underlie this activity.</s><s>We have found that these EPSPs compete with IPSPs in anesthetized mice.</s><s>Because EYFP ϩ PG cells fire action potentials at each respiration cycle, they likely mediate at least a fraction of this inhibition.</s><s>Similar to EYFP ϩ PG cells, PV ϩ cells are highly active in vivo, even in the absence of exogenously applied odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Miyamichi et al., 2013)</ref>, and thus may contribute to this inhibition.</s><s>In contrast, granule cells have a low spontaneous firing rate in anesthetized mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cang and Isaacson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Margrie and Schaefer, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kato et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, their activity is strongly enhanced in the awake animal, suggesting that the influence of each interneuron population may differ in the awake and anesthetized state <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kato et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In classical pathways, feedforward inhibition quickly follows monosynaptic excitation and defines a short temporal window of opportunity for the postsynaptic neuron to fire.</s><s>Thus, inhibition often promotes spike timing precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Pouille and Scanziani, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, we found that ON-evoked intraglomerular inhibition promotes spike timing variability in olfactory bulb mitral cells from trial to trial and also from cell to cell.</s><s>Intraglomerular lateral inhibition relies on synapses with low release probability, whereas the long-lasting ON-evoked excitation of mitral and tufted cells relies on excitatory synapses with high release probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Najac et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, IPSC timing and amplitudes vary from trial to trial and from cell to cell, unlike excitation that is highly reproducible.</s><s>Moreover, membrane properties constrain mitral cells to fire reliable and precisely timed action potentials across trials in response to an identical synaptic-like fluctuating stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Padmanabhan and Urban, 2010)</ref> or an EPSP waveform <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balu et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>This explains why each mitral cell responded to the afferent input with a stereotyped pattern of spikes in the presence of GBZ.</s><s>In addition, intraglomerular dendrodendritic excitatory interactions and gap-junction coupling drive synchronous firing in principal cells connected to the same glomerulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Schoppa and Westbrook, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ma and Lowe, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, intraglomerular inhibition competes with multiple mechanisms that tend to synchronize the output of a glomerulus.</s><s>Many neurons of the olfactory bulb network fire in synchrony in the presence of an odorant, suggesting that olfactory coding in the olfactory bulb relies, at least in part, on precise spike timing in a population of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bathellier et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Although the functional implication of intraglomerular inhibition is at present uncertain, one possible function of this pathway may be to prevent
