target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</s><s>The LC is the primary source of NE to the forebrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>LC neurons exhibit constant tonic firing at low frequencies, with frequency correlating with arousal level, behavioral performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and NE concentration in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>NE has been shown to alter neuronal excitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , suggesting the LC-NE system produces state-dependent modulatory effects on sensory processing and thus perception.</s><s>The precise mechanism underlying LC-NE modulation of stimulus feature representation in the various stages of sensory processing that underlies perception, however, remains elusive.</s></p><p><s>It is well established that the thalamus plays an essential role in gating the flow of sensorimotor information to the neocortex, serving to establish cortical representation of the sensorimotor environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> .</s><s>Thalamocortical information transmission has been proposed to be strongly modulated by the dynamic interplay between the thalamic relay nucleus and the GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Neurons in the early stages of sensory pathways selectively respond to specific features of sensory stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</s><s>In the rodent vibrissa pathway, thalamocortical neurons in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) encode kinetic features of whisker movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , allowing stimuli to be represented by distinctive, temporally precise firing patterns.</s><s>Therefore, understanding feature selectivity is crucial to understanding sensory processing and perception.</s></p><p><s>Here we examine the mechanism underlying LC modulation of thalamic feature selectivity and tactile perception through reverse correlation analysis of single-unit recordings taken from different stages of the rat vibrissa pathway while LC activation conditions were systematically varied.</s><s>Our results demonstrated an LC-activation-induced decrease in firing rate, coupled with an increase in the feature selectivity of VPm neurons, resulting in a dramatic increase in both information transmission efficiency and rate.</s><s>Surprisingly, recordings in the projecting primary trigeminal nucleus (PrV) revealed LC activity did not modulate PrV sensory transmission, suggesting the observed increase in thalamic feature selectivity was not trivially inherited from the PrV.</s><s>Inactivation of the cortical column, topographically aligned with the VPm neuron being recorded, did not affect LC-activationinduced improvement of thalamic feature selectivity, indicating corticothalamic feedback did not play a role in this improvement.</s></p><p><s>LC activation reduced burst firing for both VPm and TRN neurons.</s><s>However, VPm tonic spikes without LC stimulation carried only ~30% of the information of those during 5 Hz LC stimulation, suggesting LC-activation-improved information transmission was not a result of simply switching thalamic firing to tonic mode.</s><s>Blocking thalamic T-type calcium channels suppressed burst firing and eliminated LC-activation-induced improvement of thalamic information transmission, indicating this LC-linked improvement results from suppression of T-channel activity by NE regulation of thalamoreticulo-thalamic circuit dynamics.</s><s>Modelling results showed that NE effects in solely the VPm or TRN could not account for the dramatic increase in information transmission, suggesting that concurrent LC-NE modulation of both the VPm and TRN is necessary to alter intrathalamic circuit dynamics for optimal thalamic information transmission.</s><s>Furthermore, we found that LC activation also increased perceptual sensitivity for animals performing a tactile discrimination task.</s><s>This behavioral improvement was blocked when NE effects in the thalamus were pharmacologically precluded, confirming that LC-NE modulation of the thalamic sensory processing is critical to the LC-activation-induced improvement in perception.</s><s>These findings reveal a novel mechanism through which LC activation enhances thalamic sensory processing and perceptual performance, and suggest a brain-statedependent sub-dimension in the tonic mode of thalamic firing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>We microstimulated the LC of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats while recording single-unit activity from the VPm in the rat vibrissa pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>Placement of the stimulating electrode into the LC was verified via electrophysiology and histology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, See Methods).</s><s>All LC neurons used to initially confirm electrode location in the LC exhibited the usual hallmarks: a phasic response to paw pinch followed by a period of inhibition and a wide spike waveform <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>).</s><s>VPm neurons were identified by their depth, waveform, and their reliable, short latency response to a brief deflection of their principal whisker <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>).</s><s>On a subset of experiments, correct placement of the stimulating and recording electrodes was further confirmed by post mortem histological analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LC activation improved VPm feature selectivity while decreasing firing rate</head><p><s>To study how the LC-NE system modulates the coding properties of thalamic relay neurons and the information they transmit, single-unit extracellular recordings of VPm neurons, lasting ~2 hours, were acquired (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>During these recordings we randomly cycled through 3 varying conditions of LC activation: 0 (i.e.</s><s>no LC stimulation, as a control), 2, and 5 Hz and mechanically stimulated the principal whisker with low-pass filtered frozen white Gaussian noise (WGN) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>Each LC activation condition was typically repeated multiple times throughout each recording (range of 3-13 repetitions, average of 5.6Â±0.6 repetitions, meanÂ±s.e.m. reported for all results unless otherwise stated).</s><s>During control conditions, VPm neurons were highly responsive to WGN whisker stimulation, firing in a reliable, temporally-precise fashion at certain events in the stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f</ref>).</s><s>White noise reverse correlation analysis allowed us to recover the kinetic features of the whisker movement to which VPm neurons were significantly sensitive to (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>A VPm neuron's feature selectivity can be represented by a set of kinetic features it is sensitive to, coupled with a corresponding set of nonlinear tuning functions which map the neuron's firing rate response versus how similar the stimulus is to that feature (i.e. the 1 st and 2 nd component of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>, respectively).</s></p><p><s>When we examined the effects of LC activation on thalamic response to stimuli, we found that LC activation significantly reduced the firing rate of VPm neurons in response to WGN whisker stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>LC activation did not induce changes in the shape of the kinetic features for which a neuron was selective; however, we did find the amplitude of the recovered features increased in an LC-activation-frequency dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>To quantify this modulation of the recovered features we computed the feature modulation factor, defined as the dot product of a feature recovered under control conditions with that from LC activation conditions normalized by the dot product of the control condition recovered feature with itself (see Methods).</s><s>A feature modulation factor of 1 would indicate that LC activation had no effect on the recovered features.</s><s>If the amplitude of the recovered feature increased, then the feature modulation factor would also increase.</s><s>Indeed, we found that 2 and 5 Hz LC activation resulted in significantly increased feature modulation factors of approximately 15% and 47%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>We also calculated the average peakto-peak amplitude of the features that the VPm encoded.</s><s>Consistent with the feature modulation factor, the average peak-to-peak amplitude also increased with the frequency of LC activation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Having determined the encoded feature set for each VPm neuron under each LC activation condition, we were then able to calculate the corresponding nonlinear tuning functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, we found that LC activation resulted in a change in the nonlinear tuning functions of VPm neurons that indicated an increased selectivity of response to the specific features encoded by the VPm neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To quantify the effects of the LC-activation on thalamic transmission of information about the absence/presence of the encoded kinetic feature(s), we use an information theoretic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . 2 and 5 Hz LC stimulation drastically increased the information that each spike conveyed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, despite the reduction in VPm firing rate, LC activation also resulted in over a twofold increase in information transmission rate (bits/sec) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To rule out the possibility that the observed phenomenon was due to inadvertent stimulation of brainstem nuclei adjacent to the LC, optogenetic LC stimulation was used on a subset of experiments.</s><s>We selectively expressed ChR2 in LC neurons by injecting a lentivirus with a PRSx8 promoter that is selective for LC-NE neurons (pLenti-PRSx8-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry) into the LC <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>On a subset of animals we validated the selectivity with postmortem immunohistological analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>4 weeks after transfection, we performed the same white noise reverse correlation experiment while varying LC activation condition, as detailed above, except photostimulation was used to activate the LC instead of electrical microstimulation.</s><s>These experiments showed an LC-photoactivation-dependent-decrease in firing rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h</ref>), increase in feature selectivity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>), increase in feature modulation factor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2i</ref>), increase in information transmission (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2j</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>), and increase in information transmission rate (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s><s>This confirmed the effects of electrical microstimulation of the LC on thalamic information transmission were due to selective LC activation and unlikely due to the inadvertent activation of the adjacent nuclei or axons of passage.</s></p><p><s>To rule out the possibility that the observed phenomenon was an artifact of anesthesia and to ensure the observed phenomenon generalizes to awake animals, we recorded the response of VPm neurons to repeated WGN stimulation of their principle whisker in awake, head-fixed rats (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, see Methods) while modulating LC activity either electrically or optogenetically.</s><s>In awake rats we found that LC-activation still induced an increase in feature selectivity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>) as well as an increase in the feature modulation factor (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>Further we observed a similar LC-activation-induced increase in information transmission (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>), confirming that LC activation enhancing thalamic information transmission is a general phenomenon.</s></p></div>
