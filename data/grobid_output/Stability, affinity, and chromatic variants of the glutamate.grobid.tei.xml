all variants decayed faster than the calcium sensor GCaMP6f (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S5b</ref>).</s><s>(Recently, another iGluSnFR mutant at this site, S72T, was published <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ; in our hands, SF-iGluSnFR.S72T shows lower ΔF/F than S72A.)</s></p><p><s>In vivo, the low affinity SF-iGluSnFR.A184S variant improved detection of stimulus-evoked glutamate release in ferret visual cortical neuropil in response to drifting gratings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In neuropil, peak amplitudes reached 30% ΔF/F for SF-iGluSnFR.A184S (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>) but only 5% ΔF/F for SF-iGluSnFR.A184V (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S7a-c</ref>), and were not apparent with original iGluSnFR (data not shown).</s><s>Detectable, but lower-magnitude, changes in fluorescence were also seen on cell bodies with SF-iGluSnFR.A184S (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>).</s><s>The greater ΔF/F of SF-iGluSnFR.A184S allowed extraction of robust orientation tuning curves in regions of sparse labeling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>It also allowed orientation-selective responses to be resolved in individual dendritic spines, with some spillover onto nearby dendrites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Some individual spines showed robust orientation selectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>), while other spines on the same dendrite exhibited little or no visually-driven activity (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S8c</ref>).</s><s>The response magnitude at spines was stable over multiple stimulus presentations, with no appreciable loss in fluorescence intensity or ΔF/F (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>Response amplitudes across individual trials were consistently greater than the A184V variant (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S6c-e</ref>) when examining all stimulus-evoked responses (A184S median ΔF/F = 16%, n = 72 spines; A184V median ΔF/F = 9%, n = 22 spines; p &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) or only preferred stimuli (A184S median ΔF/F = 27%, n = 72; A184V median ΔF/F = 14%, n = 22; p &lt; 0.0001; Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S8b</ref>).</s><s>Single-trial responses from individual spines showed clear orientation selectivity and displayed robust glutamate events with high signal-to-noise ratio (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S8d</ref>.e;</s><s>Supp.</s><s>Video 1).</s></p><p><s>The fast off-rate of SF-iGluSnFR.S72A can provide more accurate quantification of quantal synaptic responses at high stimulation frequencies over SF-iGluSnFR.A184V and original-iGluSnFR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>; Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s><s>Transmitter release and its temporal depression can be decreased or increased by changing the extracellular calcium concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>SF-iGluSnFR.A184V and original-iGluSnFR could not well distinguish the differences in the temporal pattern of transmitter release between 1 mM and 3.5 mM Ca 2+ during a brief train (20 Hz).</s><s>In contrast, S72A reported the well-known conversion of facilitation of individual responses during the train to a strong depression upon switching from low to high extracellular Ca 2+ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>This makes SF-iGluSnFR.S72A more useful for assessing short-term synaptic plasticity.</s><s>S72A also enhanced spatial resolution of glutamate release over A184V (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next examined whether SF-iGluSnFR could be used as an alternative to GCaMP6f for monitoring pre-synaptic activity of granule cell axons within mouse cerebellar brain slices.</s><s>Axons of granule cells bifurcate in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex to form parallel fibers (PFs; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>), which can be reliably stimulated by local extracellular methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Single action potential (AP)-evoked fluorescence from SF-iGluSnFR.A184V was detected in individual PF boutons using fast linescan 2P imaging (~1 msec per line;
