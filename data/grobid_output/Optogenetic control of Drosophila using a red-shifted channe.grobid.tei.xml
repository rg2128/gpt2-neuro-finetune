<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optogenetic vs. thermogenetic control of gustatory neurons</head><p><s>We reasoned that previously described ChR2 variants do not work well in adult Drosophila due, at least in part, to low penetrance of blue light through the cuticle.</s><s>Indeed, direct measurements in vivo indicated that the penetrance of blue light through the cuticle is much weaker (c.a. 1 %) than that of longer wavelengths such as green or red light (5-10 %) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, we created transgenic flies that express the recently developed red-shifted channelrhodopsins, C1V1(T/T) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and ReaChR <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> under the control of the Gal4-UAS system, to test whether red shifted light can penetrate the cuticle sufficiently to activate neurons expressing these channels (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for a listing of all transgenic fly strains created).</s></p><p><s>We first compared the efficacy of different opsins to activate sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) that express the receptor Gr5a <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Optogenetic activation of Gr5a neurons using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) has previously been shown to trigger the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> (Supplementary Video 1).</s><s>All of the blue light-sensitive opsin variants tested (ChR2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , H134R <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and C128T <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> ) induced PER behavior in response to photostimulation at 470 nm, although only H134R yielded responses in 100 % of flies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Flies expressing ReaChR in Gr5a GRNs yielded robust PER responses to both red (627 nm) and green (530 nm) light.</s><s>In contrast, flies expressing C1V1(T/T) did not exhibit PERs in response to either red or green light (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Instead, they moved their proboscis slightly, albeit in a manner time-locked to photostimulation, suggesting that C1V1(T/T) has only a weak ability to activate Gr5a GRNs.</s><s>Surprisingly, in flies expressing dTrpA1 in Gr5a GRNs, we did not observe any behavioral response at an ambient temperature known to activate the ion channel (32 °C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), or during gradual ramping to this temperature from 22 °C (data not shown).</s><s>Interestingly, activation of dTrpA1 in Gr5a GRNs using heat pulses from an IR laser <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> has been reported to induce a PER.</s><s>Upon continuous current injection some neurons develop a depolarization block <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>We reasoned that if Gr5a neurons are continuously or gradually activated via TrpA1, they may undergo a rapid depolarization block that prevents PER behavior.</s><s>Consistent with this idea, continuous illumination of Gr5a-ReaChR flies produced only a transient PER reaction (half-time for decay = 1.5 sec), while pulsatile illumination (1 Hz, 100 msec pulse duration) evoked a train of PERs time-locked to each light pulse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Consistent with this, electrophysiological recording of Gr5a GRNs revealed that pulsed light caused continuous bursts of spiking throughout the stimulation period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>) with short latencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, spiking activity decayed exponentially during continuous light stimulation (half-time for decay, ∼1.5 sec; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>The rapid decay of both spiking and PER behavior during continuous activation of ReaChR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>; Pearson's correlation coefficient: r = 0.96), suggests that the former likely accounts for the latter.</s></p><p><s>Similar to the results obtained using continuous ReaChR activation, TrpA1 activation triggered only transient spiking in Gr5a GRNs, with a strong decay after several seconds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>).</s><s>Together, these data may explain why PER responses were not induced by constitutive or gradual thermal activation in Gr5a-TrpA1-expressing flies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>They also reconfirm the importance of pulsed activation of neurons to avoid depolarization block, as reported previously in other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> (but note that depolarization block does not occur in all neuronal subtypes 8 ).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activation of CNS neurons with ReaChR</head><p><s>Only a few studies have reported successful elicitation of behavior in adult Drosophila by activating CNS neurons expressing blue light-sensitive opsins <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>To determine whether activation using ReaChR would be more effective, we directly compared the behavioral responses of flies expressing blue light-vs.</s><s>red light-sensitive opsins in GAL4 lines driving expression in different populations of CNS neurons.</s><s>These lines included: HB9-GAL4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> whose activation induces side walking (Supplementary Video 2) and, at higher intensities, paralysis (loss of postural control and immobility); Corazonin (Crz)-GAL4 whose activation induces abdominal bending and ejaculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> (Supplementary Video 3); Fru-GAL4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , which labels ∼1,500 neurons throughout the brain and whose activation in males induces mating behavior including wing extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , and abdominal bending; at higher intensities, paralysis is observed (Supplementary Video 4); and "P1-GAL4," a split-GAL4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> driver generated from parental GAL4 lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> identified in a behavioral screen (E.D.H. and D.J.A., unpublished), that is specifically expressed in ∼16-20 male-specific P1 neurons, activation of which elicits wing extension in males in the absence of females <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>To facilitate the control and monitoring of light-induced behaviors in freely moving adult flies in a highthroughput, cost-effective and flexible manner, we developed a high power LED-based activation system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-c</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-e</ref>, Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, Software and Online Methods).</s></p><p><s>Strikingly, among all 5 opsins tested using these CNS drivers, ReaChR was the only one whose activation yielded robust behavioral phenotypes in a light-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>The evoked behaviors were not due to innate responses to light, because control flies lacking UAS-ReaChR did not exhibit them in response to all the wavelengths tested (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>The fact that blue-light activated opsins yielded a behavioral response (PER) when expressed in GRNs, but not in the CNS neurons tested here, likely reflects the fact that the peripheral GRNs are located close to the cuticle, where blue light may penetrate more easily.</s><s>Analysis of C1V1(T/T) expression in CNS neurons revealed that this opsin is expressed weakly in cell somata and not trafficked to arborizations, while ReaChR is strongly expressed in somata and trafficked to arborizations as well (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>This difference likely accounts for the different efficacies of the two red-shifted opsins in this system.</s></p><p><s>The peak of the ReaChR action spectrum (measured in cultured hippocampal neurons) is ∼590 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>The efficacy of ReaChR activation by different wavelengths in freely behaving flies will, however, reflect a combination of factors including cuticular penetration and intensity, as well as proximity to peak sensitivity.</s><s>To empirically determine the optimal wavelength of light for behavioral assays, therefore, we compared the ability of blue (470 nm), green (530 nm), amber (590 nm) and red (627 nm) light to induce behavior in flies expressing ReaChR under the control of different CNS GAL4 drivers.</s><s>When not normalized for intensity, green LEDs had the strongest capacity to elicit ReaChR-dependent behaviors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d,</ref><ref type="figure">f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>In some cases (pIP10 neurons;
