important for better understanding of neural functions and circuits.</s><s>We introduce the new cranial window using soft, penetrable, elastic, and transparent, silicone-based polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a substitute for the skull and dura in both rats and mice.</s><s>The PDMS can be readily tailored to any size and shape to cover large brain area.</s><s>Clear and healthy cortical vasculatures were observed up to 15 weeks post-implantation.</s><s>Real-time hemodynamic responses were successfully monitored during sensory stimulation.</s><s>Furthermore, the PDMS window allowed for easy insertion of microelectrodes and micropipettes into the cortical tissue for electrophysiological recording and chemical injection at any location without causing any fluid leakage.</s><s>Longitudinal two-photon microscopic imaging of Cx3Cr1 +/-GFP transgenic mice was comparable with imaging via a conventional glass-type cranial window, even immediately following direct intracortical injection.</s><s>This cranial window will facilitate direct probing and mapping for longterm brain studies.</s></p><p><s>To better comprehend neural function and connectivity in a living brain, it is desirable to have a large-scale cranial window that can maintain normal brain conditions for as long as possible.</s><s>Furthermore, to better utilize the recent advances in neuroscience techniques to study the wide brain network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , an ideal cranial window should have the following properties: 1) high optical clarity and a wide-field of view for longitudinal morphological and functional imaging and optogenetic stimulation, 2) simple fabrication process for any size and design of window, and 3) easy accessibility for the introduction of pharmacological drugs, dyes, and viruses at desired locations as well as for electrophysiological recording to be performed at any position within the cranial window.</s></p><p><s>Cranial windows in rodents require open-skull or thinned-skull procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> .</s><s>The well-known open-skull cranial window techniques involve a full craniotomy, in which an exposed area of the brain is sealed with a cover glass without filler material <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> or filled with either agarose <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> or silicone <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>In rats, the dura mater is removed because of its thick and opaque properties, but dural regrowth hinders optical transparency in longitudinal imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, full duratomy can easily initiate an inflammatory cascade, thereby preventing for the success of a long-term large cranial window in rats.</s></p><p><s>In mice, thinned-skull cranial window procedures have been used to minimize inflammation of the cortical area <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> , but, as is the case with rats, the skull needs to be repeatedly thinned due to regrowth <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , thus reducing the utility of this approach for longitudinal studies.</s><s>To reduce the effects of bone regrowth and perform longitudinal imaging studies, a cover glass is mounted onto a thinned area with cyanoacrylate cement <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>These cranial window techniques facilitate relatively large-area live-brain imaging with high clarity using optical approaches such as two-photon (2P) microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>However, the cover glass used in both open-and thinned-skull cranial window techniques is impenetrable.</s><s>Recently, partial solutions to these problems have been proposed, such as using removable cranial windows to inhibit dura regrowth effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , drilling a small access port to the side of a cover glass to inject calcium dye through the port <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , or attaching a microfluidic channel under a cover glass <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>However, these methods are not without drawbacks.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, an inherent problem in using glass as a cover window is its rigidity, which limits its ability to cover large brain areas with curvature.</s><s>The diameter of a typical cranial window is approximately 3 mm for open-skull windows and approximately 1 mm for thinned-skull windows.</s><s>As the window size increases, the possibility of the cover glass applying unwanted pressure on the cortical tissue arises, especially in rats, in which it may disrupt cerebrospinal fluid regulation and intracranial pressure levels.</s><s>Thus, in vivo chronic optical imaging studies in rodents using current cranial window techniques are mostly confined to small areas due to the difficulties of maintaining stable physiological conditions for large brain areas.</s><s>Biocompatibility of PDMS has been previously shown in the studies, where PDMS was used as an artificial dura within a glass-type cranial chamber in long-term primate visual studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>In primate studies, large area duratomy is needed to expose the visual cortex for clear cortical imaging.</s><s>However, it is very challenging to sustain brain health for large duratomy in monkeys.</s><s>PDMS-like silicone materials are suitable as a transparent artificial dura within the cranial window with glass cover in monkeys.</s><s>To overcome the limitations of conventional cranial window approaches, we propose a novel and simple cranial window technique using a brain cover based on soft, flexible, elastic, clear, and biocompatible PDMS.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Highly flexible and simple cranial window for chronic functional in vivo imaging.</s><s>A silicone-based organic polymer film comprising PDMS is highly flexible and can float on water due to its light weight and hydrophobic nature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>PDMS can be easily fabricated to have any desired thickness and appropriate softness by mixing the elastomer base and curing agent in a 10:1 ratio in a sterilized culture dish and by curing 1-2 h at 80 °C.</s><s>This flexible material can be tailored to any size or shape, which allows the cover to be well fitted onto the curved cortex, thereby, creating a large cranial window (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>It is well known that PDMS is highly transparent and has equal absorbance of light for wavelengths between 300 nm and 700 nm (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, we cultured cells on PDMS and found that the viability exceeded 95%, which suggests that PDMS does not cause cellular toxicity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>These confirm that PDMS is a soft, flexible, transparent, and biocompatible material.</s><s>The schematic diagram demonstrates how the soft and flexible cover material can be used as a cranial window in rats (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>We performed open-skull craniotomy of the rat with a large area covering almost one hemisphere between the bregma and lamda (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>).</s><s>In a simple surgical procedure description (see the online Methods section for details), following craniotomy and duratomy, an approximately 0.3-mm thick PDMS pad with a size of 5 × 11 mm 2 was used to cover the exposed curved cortical tissue (approximately 4 × 9 mm 2 ) and was carefully glued to the skull around the exposed cortex (green line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> between the PDMS and skull) using a cyanoacrylate adhesive.</s><s>Then, the boundary of the PDMS cranial window was sealed with a dental resin.</s><s>Over time, the biocompatibility of the material kept the skin surrounding the window healthy, and there were no noticeable signs of infection or discomfort when the individual animal was housed in its home-cages.</s><s>Examples of animal conditions at 7-8 weeks post-implantation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> &amp; Supplementary Video S1.</s><s>These results were also supported by previous reports, where biocompatible PDMS was used as an artificial dura under a conventional cranial chamber <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and as a substrate in the implantable neural-muscle interface of rat spinal cord injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The ability to capture in vivo images repeatedly is a crucial factor in evaluating the success of a cranial window.</s><s>In an open-skull cranial window with a glass cover in rats, a duratomy is required for better visibility due to inflammatory reactions as well as dural regrowth <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , which makes it difficult to maintain an optically clear window for an extended period of time.</s><s>To examine the condition of an open-skull chronic window with PDMS, 13 rats subjected to a duratomy procedure were studied for up to 10 weeks after the cranial window implantation.</s><s>Healthy cortical vasculature underneath the cranial window was constantly visualized over a large area of the rat brain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref> in one rat &amp; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref> in other rats).</s><s>Furthermore, neither cell and tissue adhesion nor noticeable bone regrowth on the PDMS were apparent during the long-term observations, possibly due to the hydrophobicity of PDMS (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>In cell culture experiments, neuronal cells rarely attached to PDMS, silicone, or agar though they did have a high affinity towards glass (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Additionally, for acute in vivo experiments (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>), PDMS can be used as a skull/dura-like substitute by directly covering exposed cortical regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , which effectively prevents the cortical surface from drying and bulging when a large cortex area is opened for several hours.</s><s>Similarly, flexible PDMS can be applied to a large curved thinned-skull area (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>In both thinned-and open-skull procedures, the PDMS cover reduces light scattering from an undulating surface and improves the visualization of cortical vessels and tissue.</s><s>These properties of high transparency and flexibility make PDMS an excellent cranial window cover for large curved brain regions.</s></p><p><s>The cranial PDMS window allowed us to perform longitudinal wide-field-of-view in vivo imaging to determine functional changes in large cortical areas.</s><s>Weekly optical recording of intrinsic signals (ORIS) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F-J</ref>) was performed during hindpaw electrical stimulation (2 section, 1 mA, 3 Hz) for up to 10 weeks after implantation of the cranial window.</s><s>The experimental set-up for ORIS and hindpaw electrical stimulation is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>.</s><s>A clear and large cortical surface image was obtained with a CCD-camera with a 570 nm filter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s><s>Robust hemodynamic responses upon stimulation were observed at 2 weeks and 8 weeks post-implantation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H,</ref><ref type="figure">I</ref>), and the maximal changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) remained similar over 10 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J</ref>), thus indicating that the PDMS cranial window is an excellent material for long-term chronic imaging, even without the dura mater and skull.</s><s>To support our in vivo data, histochemical analysis of microglial cells and astrocytes was performed after the ORIS experiments at 10-weeks post-implantation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>We observed that microglial cells and astrocytes were similar in the cortical sections of the cranial window and intact skull.</s><s>Similar functional and histochemical observations were made for all of the rats studied.</s><s>The behavioral data obtained at 4-weeks post-implantation showed that the animals with PDMS cranial window exhibited no significant differences in moving distances (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1K</ref>) and patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1L</ref>) compared to control animals.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Easily accessible cranial window for penetration at multiple sites.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Longitudinal cellular resolution two-photon imaging.</head><p><s>Large open-skull PDMS cranial windows in transgenic mice are useful for free accessing brain tissue and performing 2p imaging of deep cortical layers for an extended period of time.</s><s>The resolution of the confocal microscopic signal through PDMS was tested with 1.0 μ m fluorescent micro-spheres (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>) and the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of signal intensity was calculated from the normalized intensity profile in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>.</s><s>The FWHM of the signal obtained via PDMS (~1.60 μ m ± 0.18 μ m, mean ± SD, n = 15) was not significantly different (p = 0.99, two-tailed Student's t-test) from that of the signal via glass (~1.67 μ m ± 0.18 μ m, mean ± SD, n = 15).</s></p><p><s>For in vivo 2p imaging, a large PDMS cranial window of approximately 5 mm in diameter was implanted over the intact dura in Cx3Cr1 GFP+/-Tg mice expressing green fluorescent protein in the microglia, and a square-type head frame was used to secure the head of the mice onto a stage-frame (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>To determine the effects of the cranial window on the health of the mice, behavioral test and wide-field optical imaging were performed for up to 25 weeks after implantation.</s><s>No unusual behavior was observed in any of the 18 mice (see Supplementary Video S3, a representative mouse at 25 weeks post-implantation).</s><s>Time-lapse cranial window images were captured from the day of the surgery up to 15 weeks post-surgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>), which showed that, similarly to the observations made in rats with cranial windows, normal healthy vasculature was clearly maintained.</s><s>Overall, mice with the open-skull PDMS cranial windows remained healthy up to 25 weeks post-implantation.</s><s>However, bone and dura regrowth was evident around approximately 35 weeks post-surgery.</s></p><p><s>Longitudinal 2p microscopy imaging was used to track microglia activities and cortical microvascular structures.</s><s>We identified same microglial cells at 10-weeks and 15-weeks post-surgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>) and observed their detailed ramified morphologies in XY, XZ, and YZ axis with high resolution.</s><s>Taking advantage of the clarity of the PDMS cranial window, we conducted 2P imaging up to a depth of 600 μ m and visualized microglia cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>).</s><s>At a cortical layer depth of 50-100 μ m, perivascular microglial cells were distributed alongside large cortical vessels, whereas deeper layers showed ramified microglia, indicative of normal physiological conditions in the brain without any invasion by foreign materials or cell apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>To visualize the cortical vessels by 2P imaging, a solution of dextran-conjugated fluorescence dye was injected into the retro-orbital venous sinus (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>).</s><s>Both vasculature and microglia were clearly imaged with 2P imaging at 7 and 15 weeks post-implantation.</s><s>Real-time blood flow was also observed using an in vivo fluorescence microscope (Supplementary Video S4).</s><s>To confirm our 2P data, the microglia and astrocyte distributions in the cortex were evaluated by immunohistochemistry at 1, 3, and 10 weeks after implantation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>).</s><s>The microglia cell density in the ipsilateral chronic window side of the cortex increased at 1 week after implantation compared with the contralateral normal side but returned to normal at 3 weeks (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11A</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, at 1 week post-surgery, the astrocytes were over-activated near the surface on the ipsilateral side of the cortex compared with the contralateral side.</s><s>After 3 weeks, the astrocyte distribution in the ipsilateral cortex appeared homogeneous and was similar to the contralateral side (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11B</ref>).</s><s>In addition, vessel staining was prominent on the top layer of the ipsilateral side of the mouse brain at 1 week post-surgery but decreased at 3 and 10 weeks post-surgery (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We further studied the longitudinal interactions of microglia to a foreign protein in Cx3Cr1 GFP+/-Tg mice with PDMS cranial window (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G-M</ref>).</s><s>Cy3-labeled protein hydrogel dye, which can prolong the fluorescence signal in tissue, was used to test the in vivo dynamic reaction of microglia.</s><s>The small volume of Cy3 dye (140 nl) was directly injected into the cortex through PDMS cranial window by a glass micropipette and nanoliter-injector (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>).</s><s>The injection site was randomly selected to avoid blood vessels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H</ref>).</s><s>Immediately after removal of the glass micropipette, the sign of injection was barely noticed under the light surgical microscope (maximum magnification upto 60x), and continued invisible at 5-days post-injection, even without bond or glue application (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12A</ref>).</s><s>At 15 minutes after the injection, 2p confocal microscopic images can profile how the injected Cy3 hydrogel dye (red) interacts with microglia (green) in the cortical tissue and show Cy3 dye distributed across through 100 μ m in z-depth (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12B</ref>).</s><s>The injection site could be confirmed through 2p image on the PDMS cover (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12B</ref>, white arrows in z-depth at 1 μ m).</s><s>Moreover, the longitudinal 2p imaging up to 20 days post-injection allows chronic investigation of the dynamic responses of microglia to the injected Cy3 dye (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3I-K</ref>, lower panels).</s><s>Up to the first week, the microglia showed fast clustering towards the Cy3 dye, whereas between 1 week and 3 weeks, the peri-neighboring microglia were returned to normal condition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3I-K</ref>, lower panels) as the Cy3 signal became diffuse and weak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3I-K</ref>, upper panels).</s><s>This strongly suggests that our soft and transparent PDMS window offers excellent opportunities to study long-term brain responses to foreign dyes or chemicals, which involve in vivo injection directly via the PDMS window.</s><s>In addition, we kept animals awake for in vivo imaging.</s><s>An awake mouse with a PDMS window was walking on a treadmill for 1 hour during a 2p imaging session.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3L</ref>, the head-fix frame of the PDMS window was secured onto a bar attached to the side of the treadmill and was placed under the
