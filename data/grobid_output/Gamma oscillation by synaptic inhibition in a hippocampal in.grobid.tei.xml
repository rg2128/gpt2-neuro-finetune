<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random connection and critical sparseness</head><p><s>One of our main objectives was to assess how dense synaptic interconnections must be for the maintenance of the synchronized network oscillations.</s><s>The degree of network coherence depended on the average number of synaptic contacts per cell, M syn , in a highly nonlinear fashion.</s><s>A minimal M syn value was identified, below which the network becomes totally asynchronous.</s><s>For M syn above its critical value, the degree of network coherence becomes nonzero and increases with M syn .</s><s>We demonstrated that this critical connectedness does not increase in proportion with the number of neurons, hence, is not sensitive to the network size.</s><s>However, further analysis is needed to determine whether there is a very weak (e.g., logarithmic) dependence.</s><s>Such a dependence is expected, for instance, if the required connectedness is related to the minimal number of links for a random network to be topologically connected at large scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Erdo ¨s and Re ´nyi, 1960)</ref>.</s><s>The existence of a small critical connectedness has also been found in other neural network models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barkai et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wang et al., 1995)</ref>, suggesting that this may be a general feature of sparsely connected random neural networks.</s></p><p><s>Note that the actual value of this minimal connectedness depends on the details of single-cell and network properties, as well as on the cooperative dynamics under consideration.</s><s>Indeed, we found that synchronization of oscillations at higher frequencies requires tighter interneuronal connections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A</ref>).</s><s>Further analyses are needed to provide a theoretical understanding of this simulation result.</s><s>For rhythmicities in the gamma frequency range, our model network require 60 or more synaptic contacts from an interneuron to other interneurons.</s><s>This number is comparable with the estimated divergence/convergence factor of CA1 basket cells in the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sik et al., 1995)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We also demonstrated that synchronization of oscillatory neurons usually cannot be attributed simply to the presence of monosynaptic couplings between the respective cells.</s><s>The macroscopic network synchronization is thus a truly emergent phenomenon of large neuronal aggregates.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency selection for synchronization</head><p><s>An important finding of the present study is that interneuronal networks can be synchronized by GABA A synapses preferentially within the gamma frequency range.</s><s>This happens despite the wide range (0 -400 Hz) possible single-neuron firing rates.</s><s>For instance, when the synaptic time constant ( syn ), external drive (I ), or coupling strength (g syn ) is varied gradually, the neuronal firing frequencies change monotonically and cover a wide frequency range.</s><s>In all three cases, however, the degree of network synchronization shows a relatively narrow peak within the gamma frequency range .</s></p><p><s>This phenomenon of frequency selection may be qualitatively understood in terms of the following three neural and network properties: (1) the high network sensitivity to heterogeneities at low frequencies, attributable to the steep frequency/current curve of single neurons; (2) the minimal connectedness for the synchrony, which is larger at higher oscillation frequencies; (3) the "dynamical effect," namely, network synchronization is impossible or fragile against heterogeneities if the ratio between syn and the oscillation period T ( syn /T) becomes too small.</s><s>Hence, given syn Ӎ 10 msec, if the oscillation frequency is lower than 20 Hz (T Ͼ 50 msec), the network coherence may be abolished by a high sensitivity to input heterogeneity (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref>) and by a reduced syn /T ratio.</s><s>On the other hand, if the frequency is higher than 80 Hz, the synchrony may no longer be possible because the interneuronal connectivity is not sufficiently tight (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, the network can be highly synchronized only at 20 -80 Hz.</s></p><p><s>We would like to emphasize that this frequency band for coherent oscillations cannot be determined in an absolute precision, and its quantitative limits do depend on the details of the model.</s><s>However, our results robustly demonstrated that the synaptic time constant delimits a frequency band of coherent network oscillations, and the GABA A -type synapse (with syn Ӎ 10 msec) seems especially suitable for the gamma rhythmicity.</s><s>The limited frequency range of population gamma oscillations has been observed in the behaving rat <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bragin et al., 1995)</ref> and in hippocampal slices <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Whittington et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Traub et al., 1996)</ref>.</s><s>Our findings suggest that the synchronization mechanism by an interneuronal network would be especially effective if the fast oscillations are generated in the gamma frequency range by pacemaker neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Llina ´s et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McCormick et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, even in the absence of pacemaker neurons, coherent field oscillations could still be observed in the gamma frequency range, not because possible firing rates of inhibitory interneurons are restricted to a narrow frequency band, but because outside this frequency range the large-scale coherence is not possible (by this particular synaptic mechanism).</s></p></div>
