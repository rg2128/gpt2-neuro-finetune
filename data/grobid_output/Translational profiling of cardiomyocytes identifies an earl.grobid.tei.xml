<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>To generate cardiomyocyte ribosome-associated RNA profiles from transgenic zebrafish, we used regulatory sequences of cardiac myosin light chain 2a to drive expression of an EGFP-L10a cassette [Tg(cmlc2:EGFP-RPL10a) pd61 ] (referred to as cmlc2:TRAP) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Because the cmlc2a promoter is active in virtually all adult cardiomyocytes, the cmlc2:TRAP line is expected to identify cardiomyocyte gene expression during early injury responses as well as regenerative responses.</s><s>The TRAP reporter was expressed in cardiomyocytes, where its presence did not inhibit heart regeneration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>To assess the specificity of this approach, we immunoprecipitated ribosomeassociated RNAs from ventricles of adult cmlc2:TRAP fish and examined expression of cardiac genes.</s><s>These experiments detected known cardiomyocyte markers by PCR amplification, but genes with expression known to be restricted to other cell types were weak or undetectable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To profile gene expression after injury, we immunoprecipitated cardiomyocyte RNAs from uninjured cmlc2:TRAP fish ventricles and ventricles at 1 and 7 d after 20% apical resection (dpa).</s><s>The apical halves of ventricles were collected and pooled, and immunoprecipitated RNA was processed for microarray analysis.</s><s>We identified 138 genes with significant expression differences at 1 dpa compared with uninjured ventricles, and fewer differentially expressed genes at 7 dpa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>; raw data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus Web site).</s><s>Levels of ion transporters and channels, such as solute carrier family 39 member 3, chloride intracellular channel 5, solute carrier family 12, and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 6, were increased by 1 dpa, supporting previously identified changes in cardiomyocyte electrical properties during regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s><s>We also found increased levels of genes relevant to cell survival and proliferation, such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2), jun B proto-oncogene a, FOS-like antigen 1a, poly(ADPribose) polymerase family member 3 and 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>Compared with a published microarray dataset using whole 1-dpa ventricular tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, only 10 genes with significant expression changes are shared.</s><s>Possible explanations for this modest overlap include: (i) background noise from gene-expression changes in nonmuscle cells; (ii) specificity of the TRAP technique to ribosome-associated RNAs; and (iii) variation in gene coverage among microarrays.</s><s>TRAP did not identify some genes previously detected by visual techniques in cardiomyocytes at 7 dpa, such as gata4 and mps1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s><s>We suspect that this finding is at least in part a result of dilution of signals by cardiomyocytes that are not participating in regeneration at this stage.</s></p><p><s>Most remarkably, several members of the Janus kinase 1/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Jak1/Stat3) pathway represented on the microarray, including interleukin 6 signal transducer (il6st), jak1, stat3, and the target gene suppressor of cytokine signaling 3b (socs3b), had highly elevated levels in 1-dpa cardiomyocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>), results confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>Among seven Stat factors (Stat1-4, -5a, -5b, and -6), Stat3 is activated by a variety of cytokines/growth factors and has multiple functions in embryogenesis and cell survival/proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>.</s><s>The Jak1/Stat3 pathway was the top enriched pathway at 1 dpa as analyzed by the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool (P value: 1.4 E-4), but did not emerge as a significantly enriched pathway in previous transcriptome analyses of zebrafish heart regeneration that used whole-tissue samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>jak2a and stat2, which is expected to provide a more restricted immunoregulatory function, were recently reported by microarray or qPCR as up-regulated in 7-dpa whole-cardiac tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>However, stat2 and other stat genes did not show significant myocardial up-regulation in our experiments.</s><s>To confirm that these profiles could represent increased translation products, we assessed protein levels in whole cardiac tissue by Western blotting.</s><s>We detected increased levels of Stat3, phosphorylated Stat3, and Bcl2 protein at 1 dpa, consistent with rapid induction in cardiomyocytes after injury (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Jak1/Stat3 signaling is initiated by dimerization of the signal transducer Il6st upon cytokine binding to its receptor.</s><s>Following Il6st dimerization, Jak is activated and phosphorylates Il6st, creating a docking site for Stat3.</s><s>After phosphorylation, Stat3 dimers dissociate from the receptor, translocate to the nucleus, and activate transcription of genes involved in cell survival, cell proliferation, and other events <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</s><s>Pathway up-regulation was further confirmed by in situ hybridization.</s><s>Similar to dynamic expression signatures of certain epicardial and endocardial factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>, induction of Jak1/Stat3 pathway genes was first organ-wide at 1 dpa, but then localized to a region of cardiomyocytes at the site of regeneration by 7 dpa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> A and B, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Many ligands transduce signaling via Jak1/Stat3.</s><s>Based on identification of il6st up-regulation after injury, we examined expression of cytokine receptors that are known to mediate Il6st dimerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>We did not detect expression of the oncostatin M receptor osmr from cmlc2:TRAP samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>).</s><s>Of interleukin 6 receptor alpha (il6r-α), interleukin 11 receptor alpha (il11r-α), and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha a (lifra), we found that il11r-α was most abundantly expressed in uninjured cardiomyocytes, and its levels increased by 1 d following injury.</s><s>lifra was the next most abundantly expressed receptor, although we could not detect increased levels after injury (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>).</s><s>Correspondingly, we detected increased levels of il11r-α ligands interleukin 11 a and b (il11a, il11b) and the lifra ligand lif from whole ventricular tissue at 1 dpa, but no increases in other potential ligands like ciliary neurotrophic factor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2  C-E</ref>).</s><s>Among these genes, il11a was the most abundant ligand at 1 dpa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>).</s><s>By in situ hybridization, we detected induction of il11a throughout the ventricle in endocardial cells at 1 dpa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>), localization that was supported by histological colocalization with fli1:EGFP and by RT-PCR analysis of purified fli1: EGFP + endothelial/endocardial cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2F</ref>).</s><s>By 7 dpa, il11a reactivity was detected only at the injury site in endocardial cells, as well as other cell types (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>We did not detect the expression of il11b or lif by in situ hybridization, and by contrast with il11a, their expression was detectable at 1 dpa by RT-PCR in cells enriched for the myeloid marker pu.1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>We also detected weak expression of il11b in endothelial/ endocardial cells, whereas lif was exclusively detected in pu.1enriched cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Thus, our data indicate that cardiac injury triggers rapid induction of Jak1/Stat3 pathway members in cardiomyocytes that is coordinated with ligand production from auxiliary cells.</s><s>This program activates first in an organwide manner, then localizes to the injury site.</s><s>and anf (also known as natriuretic peptide precursor A) are expressed in

(P-Stat3), and Bcl2 at 1 dpa.</s><s>Tubulin was used as a loading control (shown for Stat3 and P-Stat3 lanes).</s></p><p><s>To define requirements for the Jak1/Stat3 pathway during heart regeneration, we created a transgenic line that enabled inducible expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 cassette [Tg(bactin2:loxp-DsRED-STOP-loxp-dnStat3-GFP) pd59 ] (referred to as β-act2:RSdS) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>This cassette is based on published studies showing that mutation of a tyrosine blocks phosphorylation and dimerization, functioning as a dominant-negative to specifically inhibit Stat3 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s><s>To express dnStat3 specifically in cardiomyocytes, we crossed this line to a second transgenic line permitting 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)-inducible Cre-mediated recombination in cardiomyocytes [Tg(cmlc2: CreER) pd13 ], and incubated animals with 4-HT.</s><s>Following 4-HT introduction and ventricular injury, there was an ∼80% reduction in expression of the target gene socs3b from whole ventricular tissue at 1 dpa, indicating reduced Stat3 activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>).</s><s>To examine the effects of dnStat3 on regeneration, we treated cmlc2:CreER;β-act2:RSdS and control β-act2:RSdS fish with 4-HT, injured their ventricles 3 d later, and allowed animals to regenerate for 30 d.</s><s>Although the ventricular walls of control animals regenerated with little or no scarring, animals with induced dnStat3 displayed prominent cardiac muscle deficiencies and scarring (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>To assess how Stat3 inhibition blocks regeneration, we examined cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury.</s><s>We observed ∼80% and ∼36% reductions in proliferation indices at 7 and 14 dpa, respectively, in 4-HTtreated fish expressing dnStat3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> C and D, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> B and C), indicating a sustained requirement in normal cardiomyocyte proliferation.</s></p><p><s>We also examined whether Stat3 activity was required for cardiomyocyte proliferation that is stimulated by low population density in juvenile and young adult animals, conditions that enable rapid animal and cardiac growth.</s><s>Low density-stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation levels are typically comparable with levels of resection-induced proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast with effects on regenerative proliferation, dnStat3 induction did not reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation indices during 10 d under accelerated growth conditions, and animals grew normally (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4 A-C</ref>).</s><s>We also found that zebrafish larvae survive to adulthood after myocardial induction of dnStat3 at 4 d postfertilization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4D</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results indicate that Stat3 requirements during cardiomyocyte proliferation are preferential or unique to the context of injury.</s></p><p><s>To determine how Stat3 levels might control cardiomyocyte proliferation, we performed a second round of unbiased screening: microarray analysis using total RNA samples collected from cmlc2:CreER;β-act2:RSdS and control ventricles at 1 and 7 dpa.</s><s>We then analyzed these microarray data together with TRAP microarray data.</s><s>We searched for genes encoding factors with increased expression after injury represented on both microarray datasets, and with reduced expression during Stat3 inhibition.</s><s>Relaxin 3a (Rln3a), a member of the Relaxin family of secreted peptide hormones first studied in reproductive tissues but also with reported roles in other tissues, met these criteria.</s><s>Relaxin ligands interact with Relaxin/Insulin-like family peptide receptors, G protein-coupled receptors that transduce signals via a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>.</s><s>In our experiments, rln3a was up-regulated 36.2-fold in cardiomyocytes by 1 dpa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), and its expression was reduced 90% by myocardial Stat3 inhibition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>Analysis of rln3a upstream sequences identified multiple predicted Stat binding sites (Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, ChIP experiments with an antibody against Stat3 showed enrichment of rln3a upstream sequences in samples from 1-dpa ventricles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> C and D), providing additional evidence of endogenous regulation by Stat3.</s></p><p><s>To test if diminished Rln3a production contributed to the dnStat3-based regenerative deficits, we treated cmlc2:CreER; lif was detected in pu.1-enriched samples; it was undetectable when the same amount of total ventricular RNA was used for amplification (total).</s><s>il11b was detected in pu.1-enriched samples and less so in fli1:EGFP + samples.</s><s>anf and tcf21 are markers for cardiomyocytes and epicardium, respectively, and were detected in total ventricular RNA samples.</s><s>(Scale bars, 50 μm.)</s><s>β-act2:RSdS zebrafish with 4-HT, injured their ventricles, and retro-orbitally introduced recombinant human Rln3 daily over a 1-wk period.</s><s>Notably, a daily 100 ng Rln3 protocol increased the cardiomyocyte proliferation index by ∼61% at 7 dpa, accounting for ∼33% of the effects of Stat3 inhibition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>).</s><s>Rln3 delivery to wild-type fish did not increase 7-dpa cardiomyocyte proliferation, and a single 100-ng treatment at 6 dpa was insufficient to increase cardiomyocyte proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>).</s><s>These results indicate that the effects of myocardial Jak1/Stat3 signaling on heart

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In summary, we have described a new transgenic line that enables the profiling of translated RNAs in zebrafish cardiomyocytes.</s><s>This reagent, and similar transgenic lines representing other cardiac cells, like endocardium and epicardium, should prove a sensitive means to identify new wild-type and mutant/transgenic expression features during cardiac morphogenesis and regeneration.</s><s>Our profiling during heart regeneration pointed to early myocardial activation of Jak1/Stat3 downstream mediators by tissue damage, events that occur concomitantly with cytokine production in endocardial and inflammatory cells.</s><s>After an initial organ-wide response, these components are coordinately enhanced at the injury site, where their activities stimulate Rln3a production and are required for cardiomyocyte proliferation.</s></p><p><s>Notably, evidence from previous studies indicates that Stat3 and Il11 are cytoprotective for murine cardiomyocytes after ischemic injury.</s><s>Il11 expression is increased in mouse hearts after myocardial infarction, and intravenous delivery of Il11 protected cardiomyocytes from apoptosis and reduced infarct size through a mechanism that requires Stat3 in cardiomyocytes.</s><s>Similarly, mice with Stat3-deficient cardiomyocytes are susceptible to both age-related and injury-induced heart failure (37-39).</s><s>These findings together with the current study indicate that Jak1/ Stat3 signaling is activated by cardiac injury in multiple vertebrate species, but with different outcomes of cardiac regeneration (zebrafish) or nonhyperplastic remodeling (mice).</s><s>It will be interesting to identify factors that interact with Jak1/Stat3 signaling and influence these outcomes.</s><s>In our study, an unbiased approach found Rln3a as a direct target of Stat3 during zebrafish heart regeneration.</s><s>Relaxin has been described to have antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, or angiogenic effects in multiple tissues, including the heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>To our knowledge, whether Stat3 mediates some of its functions through Relaxin in mammals has not been explored.</s><s>Jak/Stat signaling was recently shown to stimulate selfrenewal and differentiation of Drosophila intestinal stem cells in response to cytokine production from stressed or dying cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</s><s>In this tissue, Jak/Stat signaling is titrated and localized to stimulate cell replacement as necessary.</s><s>Jak/Stat signaling is also critical for murine liver and intestinal epithelial regeneration, and in regenerative neural tissues of zebrafish, such as retina and hair cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(46)</ref>.</s><s>It is also interesting to note that recent studies have indicated proregenerative roles of inflammatory cytokines in tissues like zebrafish brain, axolotl limb, and adult mouse skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(48)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, cytokine release and Jak/Stat signaling appear to represent general mechanisms for how injury induces and maintains local tissue regeneration in multiple contexts and species.</s></p></div>
