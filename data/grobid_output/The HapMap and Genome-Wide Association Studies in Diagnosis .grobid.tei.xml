<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUCCESSES IN IDENTIFYING VARIANTS RELATED TO COMPLEX DISEASES</head><p><s>The first notable success of the GWA method came in March 2005, with the identification of a variant in the gene for complement factor H (CFH) associated with age-related macular degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Two additional GWA studies were published within that year, of Parkinson's disease and obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>, but efforts at replicating these findings have produced inconsistent results <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>.</s><s>In 2006, strong, robust associations with electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, neovascular macu-lar degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>, and inflammatory bowel disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> were identified and have since been the subjects of a substantial body of followup research to determine gene function and population impact.</s></p><p><s>The pace of genomic discovery increased dramatically in 2007, following the increased availability of high-density genotyping platforms and experience in interpreting the results.</s><s>Simultaneous publication of coordinated efforts in multiple diseases, and of the WTCCC study, have been described above.</s><s>Rapid progress has continued into 2008 with identification of &gt; 150 loci for &gt; 60 common diseases and traits (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, as Hunter &amp; Kraft have noted, "There have been few, if any, similar bursts of discovery in the history of medical research" <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Unique aspects of the GWA method have made these discoveries possible.</s><s>For example, GWA studies allow the investigator to narrow an association region to a 10-100 kilo-base length of DNA, in contrast to the 5-10 megabases usually detected in familial linkage studies.</s><s>Because GWA regions typically contain only a few genes, rather than the dozens or hundreds implicated in linkage regions, potentially causative variants can be examined much more rapidly and in greater depth.</s><s>As noted above, systematic interrogation of the entire genome frees the investigator from reliance on inaccurate prior hypotheses based on incomplete understanding of disease pathogen-esis and genome structure and function.</s><s>The critical importance of this is illustrated by the fact that many of the associations identified to date, such as CFH in macular degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and TCF7L2 in type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref>, have been surprising-the genes were not previously suspected of being related to the disease.</s><s>Some, such as the strong associations of prostate cancer with SNPs in the 8q24 region <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref> and Crohn's disease with the 5p13 region <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, have been in genomic regions containing no known genes at all.</s><s>And because current genotyping assays capture the vast majority of human variation genome-wide, rather than being focused on particular regions or pathways, once a GWA scan is completed it can be applied to any condition or trait measured in that same individual and consistent with his or her informed consent.</s></p><p><s>Several of these discoveries have suggested etiologic pathways not previously implicated in these diseases, such as the autophagy pathway in inflammatory bowel disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>, the complement pathway in macular degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, and the HLA-C locus in control of viral load in HIV infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</s><s>Of considerable interest in determining pathophysiology have been variants or regions implicated in multiple diseases, such as the 8q24 region in prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers and the PTPN2 gene in type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS OF THE GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION METHOD</head><p><s>Important limitations of GWA studies should also be kept in mind.</s><s>One is their enormous potential for generating false-positive or spurious associations.</s><s>Because they test hundreds of thousands of statistical hypotheses-one for each allele or genotype assessed-GWA studies have enormous potential for generating false-positive results due to chance alone.</s><s>At the usual p &lt; 0.05 level of significance, an association study of one million SNPs will show 50,000 SNPs to be "associated" with disease, almost all spuriously.</s><s>One response to this problem is to reduce the false-positive rate by applying the Bonferroni correction, in which the conventional p-value is divided by the number of tests performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>A one-million-SNP survey would thus use a threshold of p &lt; 0.05/10 6 , or 5 × 10 -8 , to identify associations unlikely to have occurred by chance.</s><s>This correction has been criticized as overly conservative, but it remains the most commonly used approach to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>.</s><s>Another cause of the false-positive associations to which GWA studies are prone is population stratification.</s><s>Allele frequencies vary between population subgroups, such as those defined by ethnicity or geographic origin, and these subgroups in turn differ in their risk for disease.</s><s>GWA studies may then falsely identify the subgroup-associated genes as related to disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>.</s><s>Genotyping error is another important cause of spurious associations that must be carefully sought and corrected.</s><s>These problems have also plagued candidate-gene association studies, where systematic reviews showed that the vast majority of initial associations could not be replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>.</s><s>This experience has led to calls for all genetic association reports to include documented replication of findings as a prerequisite for publication.</s><s>Consensus guidelines for replication in any GWA study, and, crucially, for complete description of the initial study so that replication is possible, have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Another limitation of GWA studies is their lack of power for identifying associations with rare sequence variants, since these are poorly represented on current genotyping platforms, as are structural variants.</s><s>The often limited information available on environmental exposures and other nongenetic risk factors in GWA studies will make it difficult to identify geneenvironment interactions, or modification of gene-disease associations in the presence of environmental factors.</s><s>Most variants identified to date are of relatively modest effect size, conferring less than a twofold increase in disease risk and necessitating large sample sizes to detect their effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>.</s><s>Although the importance of risk factors with small effect is debated, the potential for purifying selection to eliminate risk variants of large effect is unique to genetic studies and will tend to keep effect sizes small for common variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>.</s><s>Modest associations can point the way to important therapeutic avenues, and, when considered in combination, may identify persons at substantially increased risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Such information can be particularly important, even in the absence of specific pharmaceutical agents targeted to such individuals, for more aggressive effortstoreduce known risk factors that are modifiable, such as obesity in prediabetes and smoking in age-related macu-lar degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA RELEASE AND PARTICIPANT PRIVACY</head><p><s>GWA studies produce massive data sets, often representing substantial investments of public funds and providing unparalleled opportunities for research into complex diseases.</s><s>Recognizing the research potential of these data sets, and following an extended period of public comment, NIH released its Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies, recommending widespread and responsible release of GWA data to the scientific community through the Database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54)</ref>.</s><s>Study descriptions and protocols are available in the open-access portion of the db-GaP website; individual-level data are provided through a controlled-access process consistent with participants' informed consent.</s><s>This commitment to rapid data release builds on the now wellestablished ethic in genomic community research projects of maximizing data access.</s><s>Other GWA data access sites include the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) data portal <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref> and the European Genotype Archive (EGA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>.</s><s>Policies for data release have been developed collabora-tively among these projects and are quite similar.</s><s>Published GWA studies and major findings are also catalogued by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, and GWA literature citations are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (57).</s></p><p><s>The extensive genotype and phenotype information deposited in dbGaP raises important questions about possible risks to confidentiality of individual participants in broad data-sharing models.</s><s>NIH policies were thus developed with deliberate attention to participant protections, both in the process of data submission from the original studies and in the processes of data access and use by outside investigators.</s><s>A key aspect of the protections provided in dbGaP is removal of potentially identifying information prior to data submission, using criteria very similar to those described within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Substantial participant protections are also applied at the dbGaP data-user level through a process managed by a Data Access Committee (DAC) composed of senior NIH staff.</s><s>Investigators interested in obtaining controlled-access dbGaP data submit a Data Access Request, cosigned by their institution, constituting their agreement to abide by the principles and practices detailed in the NIH GWA study policy.</s><s>These include keeping the data secure; using them only for the approved research purposes; acknowledging NIH policies on publications and intellectual property (IP); and submitting periodic reports on data use.</s><s>Data users also agree not to distribute individual-level data in any form to any third parties (other than their own research staff who have agreed to the terms of access), nor to attempt to identify individual study participants.</s></p><p><s>Recognizing the unprecedented pace of scientific progress in this field, NIH has designed its policies on data sharing in GWA studies to adapt to rapid technical advances.</s><s>For example, data summaries and other group-level data such as allele frequencies and association statistics were initially provided in the open-access portion of dbGaP, in the belief that grouped data carried no threats to individual privacy.</s><s>An innovative analysis for resolving the presence of an individual's DNA in a mix of DNA (as from a mass disaster) subsequently showed that an individual could be determined to have contributed to grouped allele frequency data with high reliability if one had data on that individual's genotypes at hundreds of thousands of SNPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(58)</ref>.</s><s>NIH responded swiftly to remove these data sets from open access and place them behind the controlled-access process, and to notify other major data providers as well, who took similar actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(59)</ref>.</s><s>Data access policies will continue to evolve with ongoing scientific advances in the field, to ensure that state-of-the-art data can be distributed and used in the most responsible and productive manner.</s></p><p><s>Ensuring confidentiality and privacy is vital for databases containing individual-level genotype or phenotype information.</s><s>Important concerns about the potential for persons carrying riskassociated variants (i.e., essentially everyone) becoming the object of discrimination by employers or insurers must be addressed.</s><s>Application of GWA findings and other genomic research will be greatly facilitated by the formal legal protection against discrimination based on genetic information provided by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) that was signed into law in May 2008.</s><s>When it goes into effect in 2009, GINA will protect against discrimination by health insurers and employers on the basis of genetic information.</s><s>It is particularly important for GWA studies because of the breadth of information obtained in such studies; almost certainly every individual will carry at least one risk allele for at least one common disease.</s><s>Protections under GINA will not only shield study subjects from the risk of genetic discrimination due to their participation in research, but more importantly will ensure that clinicians can order genetic tests identified from GWA studies to make more effective treatment decisions and can place this information in patients' records without risk to patients or their families.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USE OF FINDINGS BY PHYSICIANS AND THE PUBLIC</head><p><s>Although GWA discovery studies provide valuable clues to genomic function and pathophysiologic mechanisms, they are only a first step in identification of disease genes and are many steps removed from actual clinical application.</s><s>Nonetheless, they tend to receive considerable media attention and have the potential for generating queries from patients about whether to get tested for the "new gene for Disease X" based on the latest report <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>.</s><s>As noted above, many SNPs identified from such studies, as well as the genes or regions containing them, are currently of unknown function.Inad-dition, SNPs from GWA studies in complex diseases (unlike many Mendelian disorders) do not predict unequivocally who will develop disease and who will remain free of it.</s><s>Instead, individuals carrying a particular risk genotype implicated in a GWA study have a greater risk (and sometimes only a modestly greater risk) of developing a complex disease than those who do not.</s></p><p><s>The distinction between disease prediction and disease susceptibility is important because for many common variants, a substantial number of persons who do not carry the at-risk genotype may develop disease anyway owing to environmental or other factors.</s><s>Indeed, for common diseases such as hypertension or diabetes, environmental or lifestyle factors may play such a strong role relative to genetics that many individuals with the at-risk genotype will develop disease for reasons that are probably unrelated to genotype, and others with the at-risk genotype may remain healthy in the absence of other important environmental exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(60)</ref>.</s><s>Identifying subgroups of individuals in whom SNP-outcome associations differ according to the presence or absence of other SNPs or environmental factors might eventually be of considerable clinical use, particularly for environmental factors that can be modified.</s></p><p><s>The consensus at present is that GWA findings provide important clues to disease etiology and pathways to treatment, but current information is far too preliminary to recommend their use inprevention or treatment recommendations.</s><s>Use of GWA findings in screening for disease risk, though beginning to be marketed commercially, is problematic.</s><s>Although getting the latest "gene test" may be alluring, evidence is needed that such screening adds information to known risk factors (such as age, smoking, obesity, and family history), that effective interventions are available, that improved outcomes justify the associated costs, and that obtaining this information does not have serious adverse consequences for patients and their families.</s></p><p><s>Given the availability of many genetic tests to anyone willing to pay for them, however, clinicians are soon likely to face anxious patients equipped with genotype information showing them to be at risk for multiple diseases.</s><s>This may provide a "teachable" moment for encouraging patients to apply known preventive strategies against the conditions for which they are at increased risk.</s><s>Such encounters also provide critical opportunities to discourage complacency in preventive strategies for which geno-typing information suggests a patient is not at increased risk.</s><s>This is because so little is known about genetic influences on complex diseases and because variants identified to date typically explain so small a proportion of population risk.</s><s>It may be useful to point out to patients considering purchasing these tests that obtaining a family history is often simpler and almost always cheaper.</s><s>A positive family history typically confers a three-to fourfold increase in the risk of many diseases and is extremely useful in identifying persons to target for more intensive screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(61)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UTILITY OF FINDINGS FOR RESEARCH</head><p><s>Perhaps the greatest initial utility of GWA findings is in the clues they provide for disease etiology, therapeutic targets, and gene function.</s><s>As noted above, several of these discoveries have suggested etiologic pathways and therapeutic opportunities not previously implicated in the complex diseases with which they are associated, such as the autophagy pathway in inflammatory bowel disease, the complement pathway in macular degeneration, and the HLA-C locus in control of viral load in HIV infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Intriguing potential genetic connections between diseases previously believed to be unrelated-such as the finding that risks of type 2 diabetes, coronary disease, and familial melanoma are all associated with variants near CDKNA2A/B, or that risks of Crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes are related to variants near PTPN2-suggest new avenues of research in identifying other similarities in etiology, progression, or treatment of these conditions.</s><s>The not infrequent occurrence of associations in "gene deserts" far from any known genes invites the question of whether studies of disease pathogenesis have been too focused on coding regions of the genome and have missed other important structural and functional clues to ge-nomic regulation.</s></p><p><s>Research to pursue initial GWA discoveries will include replication studies in the same phenotypes and populations, to ensure the robustness of the findings, and in similar but not identical phenotypes and populations, to extend the findings and increase understanding of their mechanisms and importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>.</s><s>Investigation of disease subtypes, such as estrogen receptor-positive versus -negative breast cancer, or young-onset or severely progressive forms of prostate cancer or diabetes, may be of great value in identifying which subgroups of alleles confer the highest risk and which subgroups of persons carry those alleles.</s><s>Functional studies of highly replicated variants, in experimental models such as knockdown and overexpression studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and in relationship to gene expression, as recently demonstrated for asthmaassociated variants in ORMDL3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(62)</ref>, will help to determine the mechanisms of gene function and how they are perturbed in disease, providing insights into possible preventive or therapeutic strategies.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY</head><p><s>The genome-wide database of human genetic variation produced by the International HapMap Project has provided a radically new approach for searching for genetic variants associated with complex diseases.</s><s>The overwhelming success of these studies has led to surprising new insights into disease pathophysiol-ogy and therapeutic approaches, as well as new questions about genomic structure and function (and its interaction with genomic variation and environmental factors) in disease causation.</s></p><p><s>GWA studies represent a powerful new tool for identifying genetic variants related to complex diseases, but they also have important limitations, including their potential for false-positive results and lack of sensitivity to detect rare variants.</s><s>Their primary uses for the foreseeable future are likely to be in the investigation of biologic pathways of disease causation and normal health and development.</s><s>Clinical application of these findings will require firm evidence that testing for them adds information to known risk factors, that effective interventions are available, that improved outcomes justify the associated costs, and that obtaining this information does not have serious adverse consequences for patients and their families.</s><s>Although most GWA findings are clearly several steps removed from main-stream clinical use at present, functional investigation and experimental application of these findings are expected to produce new advances in the prevention and treatment of common diseases.</s></p></div>
