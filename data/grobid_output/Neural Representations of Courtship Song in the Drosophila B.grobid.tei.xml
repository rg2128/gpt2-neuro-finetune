population responses decrease in magnitude with increasing stimulus intensity.</s><s>The JONs are mechanically coupled to the arista, which vibrates in response to sound stimulation.</s><s>A previous study found that arista responses, assayed with laser Doppler vibrometry, shift their peak response frequency with increasing intensity of white-noise stimulation, across a similar intensity range (Go ¨pfert and Robert, 2002).</s><s>While we do not know how JON frequency responses might shift for different white-noise intensities and angles of the incident sound wave than those we examined (see Materials and Methods), we hypothesize that intrinsic cellular properties of the JONs may transform response curves of the arista, to maximize responses at certain distances from the sound source (and therefore particular intensities) and diminish responses to higher intensities (when the male fly comes too close to the female's receiver, for example), across a broad frequency range.</s><s>Indeed, other studies that have assayed the JON population with LFP recordings have found that for high intensity tonal stimuli (Ͼ1 mm/s), responses decrease with increasing intensity <ref type="bibr"

not know which of the ϳ50 -100 JO-A neurons are presynaptic to AMMC-A1 neurons, and therefore cannot compare tuning directly between presynaptic and postsynaptic partners, we do not observe a similarly complex transformation for responses to pulse stimuli.</s><s>One possibility to explain this difference between steady-state and transient tuning is that the JON LFP represents the activity of JO-A neurons for transients, but not at steady state (that is, other JO neurons that innervate different zones of the AMMC dominate the response at steady state).</s><s>We think this possibility is unlikely given previous calcium imaging experiments, which demonstrated that JO-AϩB neurons produce the strongest steady-state responses to sinusoidal vibration (com-pared with JO-CE neurons), and of the AϩB neurons, JO-A neurons respond preferentially to frequencies between 100 and 900 Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kamikouchi et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>This same study reported that killing

intensities.</s><s>While the strength of enhancer lines used for neuronal killing may have varied across these experiments, these data collectively suggest that JO-A neurons dominate the JO response to vibratory stimuli in the frequency and intensity range we examined.</s><s>We therefore posit that the transformation at steady state arises rather from an active mechanism within the AMMC neurons themselves.</s><s>Such a mechanism may involve synaptic adaptation during responses to longer stimuli, which are characterized by sustained depolarization of the membrane potential.</s><s>Indeed, for responses to pulse trains composed of short IPIs (20 ms), we observed larger DC shifts in the membrane potential than for longer IPIs, but the same peak response amplitudes (Fig. <ref

listening to natural sounds specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Engel et al., 2001)</ref>; that is, a feedback system whose activity is based on the social importance of the sound might shape AMMC responses to match JO tuning curves for pulse songs specifically.</s><s>Regardless of mechanism, differences in steady-state versus transient responses may have evolved based on the different

encoding natural stimuli, which, regardless of sensory modality, largely consist of transients <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rieke et al., 1997)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We have characterized detailed tuning curves for one subset of neurons within the AMMC.</s><s>We do not know, however, how these tuning curves might differ for other AMMC neurons, nor which AMMC neurons are involved in the female's song response.</s><s>We can therefore only correlate the responses we record with potential behavioral significance.</s><s>In light of this, do our recordings offer any insights into mechanisms for speciesspecific song recognition?</s><s>Pulse song responses are similar at the level of the JO in D. mel and D. sim, and are likely also to be similar at the level of the AMMC-A1 neurons in these two species.</s><s>These results may hint at the fact that the detection of conspecific song happens downstream from the AMMC.</s><s>However, measurable DC shifts (sustained depolarization) in the AMMC-A1 membrane potential occur in response to pulse songs with IPIs Յ35 ms (estimated using the same simulation described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, but instead drawing from the measured AMMC-A1 decay times while systematically varying IPI).</s><s>If this elevation of the membrane potential is sufficient to support neurotransmitter release (e.g., by causing sustained Ca 2ϩ entry into the presynaptic terminal of the AMMC neurons), it could signal the preferred IPI.</s><s>However, according to this hypothesis, the D. mel IPI range [30 Ϯ 5 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cowling and Burnet, 1981)</ref>] would also produce a DC shift in D. sim AMMC-A1 neurons, which likely have similar decay constants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</s><s>This might not pose a problem to D. sim females, as, due to large differences in pheromone profiles, D. mel males rarely, if ever, sing to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Moulin et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>That is, decay times may not have diverged in D. sim due to a lack of evolutionary pressure to do so.</s><s>The broad range of D. sim IPIs overlaps that of D. mel; therefore, D. sim males, which court D. mel females, occasionally produce IPIs that can drive DC shifts in D. mel AMMC neurons.</s><s>D. mel females could then use this DC shift (driven more reliably by D. mel song) to signal the difference between the two species.</s><s>Our model could be validated by comparisons in other species pairs that hybridize in the wild, but with different pulse songs, such as Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila santomea or Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barbash, 2010)</ref>, and the development of genetic tools in other Drosophila species should permit such experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Holtzman et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The mechanism we propose suggests that early auditory neurons (first-and second-order neurons) already contain sufficient information for making distinctions between species; there is precedent for this in both the grasshopper <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Machens et al., 2003)</ref> and cricket <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Nabatiyan et al., 2003)</ref> auditory systems.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we find that responses to fly song are well matched between the JON population and AMMC-A1 neurons, and that passing the JO population response through a simple linear filter recapitulates the AMMC-A1 response to song.</s><s>AMMC-A1 neurons thus filter out information about pulse frequency that is encoded by the JONs (in the frequency doubling the JONs produce at the population level).</s><s>Put another way, the JONs set the range of frequencies and intensities that the auditory system can respond to, and AMMC neurons, one synapse downstream from the JONs, filter the JON input to primarily preserve information about pulse timings, which are known to have behavioral relevance during courtship (Bennet- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clark and Ewing, 1969)</ref>.</s><s>The fly auditory system may thus turn out to be an excellent model for studying the neural encoding of temporal patterns and sequences.</s><s>By characterizing tuning in fine detail for one neuron type within the AMMC, our study sheds a first light on how sound is processed along the early stages Drosophila auditory pathway.</s><s>Future studies should be directed at determining (1) if all AMMC neurons are similarly tuned and, if so, what synaptic properties between JONs and AMMC neurons establish these tuning curves, and (2) the identities and response profiles of downstream neurons in the Drosophila auditory pathway that read out these auditory codes from the AMMC.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Courtship songs and
