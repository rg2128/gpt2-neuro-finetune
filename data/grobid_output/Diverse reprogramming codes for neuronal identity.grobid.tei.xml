<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defining a core neuronal transcriptome</head><p><s>Gene networks shared by the iN cells and endogenous neuron and brain samples are of interest as they could define a 'core' neuronal transcriptome that arises both in vivo and in vitro.</s><s>Conversely, genes found in the endogenous neuron and brain samples but not in the iN cells could reflect differences in cell types, neuronal maturity, the influence of exogenous signalling, or signs of incomplete reprogramming.</s><s>In our analysis, the number of genes differentially expressed in the endogenous neuron and brain samples compared to MEFs (n = 2,965) was similar to that of the iN cells.</s><s>We defined a candidate core neuronal transcriptome from the intersection (75.5% overlap) of the iN cell-enriched genes (versus MEFs) and the endogenous neuron and brain-enriched genes (versus MEFs).</s><s>The number of genes shared between the core transcriptome and each individual population was similar among endogenous and iN cell populations (78 ¬± 7%, range 63-86%).</s><s>Genes that were not enriched in iN cells were associated with GO terms related to glia, myelination and neural development, suggesting that iN cells express the majority of 'pan-neuronal' genes but not genes characteristic of glia or neuronal precursors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a</ref>, b, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>This highlights the capacity for diverse transcription factor pairs to independently converge on shared transcriptional signatures of neuronal identity and suggests that the result of direct reprogramming is similar to the result of normal neuronal development with respect to this core transcriptome.</s></p><p><s>This observation raises the question of whether the gene networks shared by iN cells and endogenous neurons are governed by similar mechanisms.</s><s>Regulatory mechanisms resulting in neuronal identity may include loss of repressors of neuronal identity and/or gain of activators of neuronal genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3e</ref>).</s><s>To identify candidate regulatory factors we applied two complementary bioinformatic tools, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment (HOMER).</s><s>IPA identified 39 candidate transcriptional regulators that we divided into five classes (I-V).</s><s>HOMER motif analyses identified 48 enriched motifs of which four overlapped with the results from IPA. Class I and II genes appear to be repressors because they are more highly expressed in MEFs compared to iN cells or endogenous neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3f</ref>).</s><s>We termed Class I genes 'common repressors' because they are expressed at lower levels in all iN cells and endogenous neurons, whereas Class II repressors exhibit subclass-specific patterns.</s><s>The most enriched binding domain is that of the Class I gene Rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , which was recently shown to increase the efficiency of direct reprogramming when knocked down using silencing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), highlighting the potential for network analyses to uncover mechanisms that may enable improved reprogramming methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3f</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Class III and IV genes represent candidate activators, based on reduced expression in MEFs in comparison to endogenous neurons (Class III) or iN cells (Class IV).</s><s>These include genes for transcription factors that are known to regulate neuronal differentiation and diversity, such as Isl1 and Eomes.</s><s>We identified only one candidate Class V 'common activator' transcription factor (Mecp2) that was expressed in all iN cells and endogenous neurons at higher levels than in MEFs, consistent with its high expression level in the brain and role in synaptic function.</s><s>Together, these analyses suggest a model in which common mechanisms for gene derepression operate both in development and direct reprogramming, whereas gene activation may arise through different mechanisms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3e</ref>, f, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single-cell RNA-seq of iN cells</head><p><s>A key question regarding the iN cell populations is the extent to which they exhibit homogeneity versus heterogeneity.</s><s>We investigated this using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq).</s><s>We analysed four representative iN cell populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4a</ref>, Methods).</s><s>iN cells that were produced with the same transcription factor pair display relative homogeneity and generally cluster together.</s><s>Cells falling outside of the main clusters have low total unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts, which is likely to lead to low expression of subtype genes and miscategorization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>The majority of iN cells expressed pan-neuronal markers such as Mapt (encoding tau) and Tubb3 and mature markers (Map2 and Snap25), although iN cells derived with the non-POU factor encoded by Nr4a2 (also known as Nurr1) exhibited a slightly more graded expression, perhaps due to lower overall UMI counts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Population RNA-seq experiments detected low levels of myocyte-related genes in iN cells produced using an Ascl family member, but not in other populations.</s><s>Mapping these genes onto the Ascl2/Nr4a2 single-cell data identified a small subpopulation of cells (3 of 90) with that exhibited coordinated co-expression of these genes, consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> (Extended Data Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">6b,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Similarly, the weak residual expression of MEF genes observed in population RNA-seq of iN cells could derive from rare contaminating MEFs in the sorted cells and/or residual MEF gene expression in the iN cells.</s><s>We sorted and profiled single MEFs (tau-eGFP -) and iN cells (tau-eGFP + ) from the same reprogramming experiment.</s><s>This revealed a small population of cells with strong MEF gene expression, suggesting that contaminating MEFs in the FACS experiment may account for much of this signature.</s><s>However, a few candidate MEF genes were expressed at low levels throughout the iN cell populations (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also explored the diversity of iN cells by identifying genes that are differentially expressed between different iN cell populations using scRNA-seq.</s><s>Among these were receptors, ion channels and transmembrane proteins, some of which have known roles in disease (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6f</ref>).</s><s>Individual iN cells within a population also exhibited mosaic expression of certain genes, either owing to inherent cellular diversity or high drop-out rates seen with scRNA-seq.</s><s>However, t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) clustering of each individual transcription factor combination did not detect significant subclusters within populations, supporting a model in which iN cells exhibit low intra-population heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6e</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, while population RNA-seq data are sensitive to small subpopulations of contaminating cells, the overall predictions they make map well to the patterns of gene expression in individual iN cells.</s><s>This suggests that each transcription factor pair induces a limited set of potentially related iN cell fates, as shown for induced sensory neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diversity among iN cells</head><p><s>To assess patterns of transcriptional diversity among the iN cell populations, we applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to generate co-expression modules <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>As expected, several modules resembled the core transcriptome;
