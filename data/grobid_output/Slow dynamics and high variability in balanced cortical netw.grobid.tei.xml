<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spiking statistics for uniform and clustered networks</head><p><s>To quantify changes in network dynamics introduced by clustering, we calculated spike train statistics for excitatory neurons in uniform and clustered networks.</s><s>The firing rate distribution was similar for both network types (3.3 ± 4.1 Hz for clustered and 2.0 ± 1.8 Hz for uniform networks; ± denotes s.d.</s><s>across the population).</s><s>Although neurons in the clustered network exhibited transient high activity states, both networks exhibited low, broadly distributed time-averaged firing rates, consistent with recordings from spontaneously active cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To measure spiking variability, we calculated the spike count Fano factor for each excitatory neuron, defined as the ratio of trial-to-trial variance to mean of the number of spikes a neuron emits in a fixed time window (here 100 ms; see Online Methods).</s><s>For a Poisson process with a fixed firing rate, the Fano factor is 1, and Fano factors above 1 may be interpreted as evidence for variability in a neuron's underlying firing rate.</s><s>High Fano factors before and during stimulus application have been observed in many cortical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In uniform networks, the mean Fano factor was 0.78 (s.d.</s><s>0.09; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>In clustered networks, it was substantially larger, with a mean of 1.4 (s.d.</s><s>0.7).</s><s>This additional variability arose from firing rate fluctuations introduced by cluster state transitions from low to high activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Because these transitions were stochastic, the configuration of highly active clusters for any given moment across trials was variable.</s></p><p><s>Cortical variability is also reflected in the joint activity of neuron pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Excitatory neurons in both network types exhibited near-zero average spike count correlations (0.001 ± 0.06 for clustered and 0.0005 ± 0.05 for uniform networks, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>; see Online Methods), consistent with past theoretical studies of balanced networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>However, differences emerged when the calculation of correlation was restricted to neurons in the same cluster.</s><s>Clustered networks exhibited a distribution of correlation coefficients for intra-cluster pairs with a long positive tail and a mean of 0.13 (s.d.</s><s>0.18; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>The distribution's tail reflected the slow correlated fluctuations in average firing rate that neurons experienced.</s><s>Because intracluster pairs only accounted for 2% of all excitatory neuron pairs, this tail was not visible in the distribution of randomly sampled correlation coefficients (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To analyze this slow spiking activity, we computed spike train auto-covariance and crosscovariance functions for excitatory neurons (see Online Methods).</s><s>Neurons in uniform networks exhibited no long timescales in their autocovariance or cross-covariance functions, whereas in clustered networks both exhibited long timescale decays (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Both functions indicated a weak oscillatory tendency in the gamma frequency range due to interactions between excitatory and inhibitory populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Finally, we explicitly related the system's long timescales to trial-to-trial variability by computing Fano factors as a function of time window.</s><s>Compared to an imbalanced network in which responses were mean-driven, Fano factors for balanced networks were substantially larger (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>), although they were still sub-Poisson owing to refractory effects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>), saturating for time windows greater than 100 ms.</s><s>However, Fano factors increased for longer time windows in clustered networks.</s><s>In total, clustered networks had slow firing rate fluctuations while retaining the fast spiking variability characteristic of balanced networks, making neuronal activity effectively a 'doubly stochastic' process <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heterogeneity in cluster membership</head><p><s>In previous sections, we studied an idealized model in which all clusters were identically sized and neurons belonged to only one cluster.</s><s>This connectivity led to discrete and unambiguous transitions between high and low activity states (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>However, cortical assemblies may involve heterogeneity in size and overlap in membership.</s><s>To determine whether our results hold for heterogeneous clustered networks, we generated a new network architecture in which cluster membership was random.</s><s>Each excitatory neuron was assigned to two clusters out of 100 total, and connection probability and strength were increased for neuron pairs that shared membership in at least one cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Because of the random assignment of neurons to clusters, cluster sizes were heterogeneous (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because neurons were not ordered by group membership, transitions were not immediately apparent in an unordered raster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>However, when rows in the raster were sorted by cluster, slow transitions appeared (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>To compare homogeneous and heterogeneous clustered network dynamics, we calculated average firing rates for all neurons in individual clusters.</s><s>Clusters in homogeneous networks exhibited discrete transitions between low and high activity states, with average firing rates of 50-60 Hz (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>, top).</s><s>In contrast, heterogeneous clustered networks exhibited more complicated temporal dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>, bottom).</s><s>Hence, networks with clustered architectures can generate complex firing rate patterns reminiscent of those seen in spontaneous cortical recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , although our study's primary results can be understood in the idealization of homogeneous clustered networks.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased clustering lengthens rate fluctuation timescale</head><p><s>We have shown that clustered connections introduce new, slow dynamics not present in uniform networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We next show that this timescale is related to the density of clustering.</s></p><p><s>We examined three different clustered network connectivities with R EE increasing from 2 to 3. As R EE increased, neurons were more easily separated into distinct clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>) and clusters exhibited longer periods of high activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>To quantify the firing rate fluctuations' dependence on network connectivity, we calculated the average excitatory neuron Fano factor as a function of R EE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>Fano factors increased for sufficiently high clustering.</s><s>The degree of clustering R EE can be recast in terms of the percentage of excitatory connections that need to be rewired to generate a clustered network from a uniform one.</s><s>This quantity was below 5% for the range studied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>Thus only a small perturbation from uniform connectivity is required for substantial firing rate fluctuations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependence of dynamics on cluster and network size</head><p><s>We next investigated whether changes in network dynamics were robust to different connectivity parameters.</s><s>Above we saw that, above a critical level of clustering (approximately R EE = 2.5), the network exhibited high firing rate variability.</s><s>However, for large R EE , transitions occurred over very long timescales (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>, right).</s><s>Hence variability on biophysically relevant timescales should be maximized for a fixed level of clustering, a prediction we investigated by varying network parameters.</s></p><p><s>We evaluated cluster firing rate variability as a function of R EE , for different network sizes N and cluster sizes C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>).</s><s>For each combination of N and C, there existed a critical value of R EE above which firing rate variability increased.</s><s>However, variability eventually decreased for higher R EE , when the transition timescale was longer than the simulation time.</s><s>This was in contrast to the dependence of the Fano factor on clustering (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>), as Fano factors were computed across trials with different initial conditions whereas firing rate variability was computed over time.</s></p><p><s>The shape of these curves depended both on N and C. As C increased, the firing rate variability peak location and height decreased because more excitatory connections were present and cluster transition times diminished.</s><s>However, the peak location increased as N grew because, in balanced networks, synaptic strength scales inversely with network size (see Online Methods).</s><s>Because a peak occurred for each combination of N and C, our results are robust to changes in network parameters.</s><s>We further explore network scaling in the next section.</s></p></div>
