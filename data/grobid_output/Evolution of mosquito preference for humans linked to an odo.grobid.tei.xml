<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domestic and forest mosquitoes continue to coexist in Rabai, Kenya</head><p><s>Forest and domestic mosquitoes were last documented in Rabai, Kenya in the 1970s, and we returned there in 2009 to determine whether they still exist.</s><s>We collected Ae. aegypti larvae and pupae in water-storage containers inside approximately one in every five homes visited (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a-b</ref>).</s><s>We also collected eggs, larvae, and pupae of several mosquito species, including Ae. aegypti, outdoors in natural and artificial containers in villages and nearby forest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>From these collections, we established 29 laboratory colonies, each descending from fewer than 20 males and females collected in the same house or outdoor location (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Previous reports described differences in body colour between the forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">6</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, females from all outdoor colonies and some indoor colonies were black, resembling forest mosquitoes.</s><s>Those from the remaining indoor colonies were brown, resembling domestic mosquitoes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>).</s><s>Differences in thorax colour were maintained across multiple laboratory generations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e-h</ref>; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Black and brown colonies also differed in abdominal scaling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1i</ref>).</s><s>A single indoor colony, K14, showed a mix of black and brown morphologies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e-i</ref>).</s><s>Black mosquitoes resembled a subspecies formosus colony from inland Africa (Uganda), while brown mosquitoes resembled a subspecies aegypti colony from Asia (Thailand) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e-i</ref>).</s><s>In light of these morphological differences, and genetic differences among the field-collected progenitors of our colonies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">13</ref> , we hereafter refer to black and brown colonies as forest and domestic, respectively.</s><s>In summary, mosquitoes fitting the morphological description of the two forms continue to coexist in Rabai, Kenya, 35 years after they were last documented.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domestic mosquitoes have evolved strong preference for humans</head><p><s>We used three assays to characterise the preference of forest and domestic forms for humans versus non-human animals.</s><s>We offered guinea pig as a non-human host because it is among the diverse hosts to which forest mosquitoes respond <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">11</ref> .</s><s>In a biting assay where females are exposed directly to live hosts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), forest females preferred the guinea pig (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>) and domestic females weakly preferred the human (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>Domestic females were approximately twice as likely to respond overall (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>), possibly reflecting adaptation to indoor environments, and by extension laboratory settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">14</ref> .</s><s>When host cues were presented in an olfactometer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>), forest and domestic females again showed significantly different preferences and response rates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), with domestic females displaying a strong preference for humans.</s><s>All colonies fell into two discrete behavioural clusters corresponding precisely to the forest and domestic designations that we made on the basis of morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2g</ref>).</s><s>Behaviourally, forest colonies resembled subspecies formosus from Uganda, and domestic colonies resembled subspecies aegypti from Thailand.</s></p><p><s>We further confirmed these results with host-scented nylon sleeves supplemented with equal amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a potent activator of mosquito host-seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">15</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h</ref>).</s><s>Three domestic colonies retained their strong preference for humans, while three forest colonies ranged from no preference to moderate preference for guinea pig (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To extend our results to other non-human hosts, we also assessed the preference of a small subset of colonies for human versus chicken in the live host assay, obtaining qualitatively similar results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2i</ref>).</s><s>Our findings confirm that domestic mosquitoes have evolved a marked preference for human body odour.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human preference is associated with changes in OR expression</head><p><s>Novel chemosensory preferences in insects are sometimes accompanied by changes in the peripheral chemosensory system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[20]</ref> .</s><s>We reasoned that altered gene expression in antennae may contribute to preference, and profiled differential gene expression in this major olfactory organ using RNAseq.</s><s>To identify general differences between forms, we compared forest versus domestic colonies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h</ref>).</s><s>To determine which of these differences are genetically associated with host preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">21</ref> , we crossed two representative colonies and compared pools of strongly human-versus guinea pig-preferring F2 hybrids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-b</ref>).</s><s>959 antennal genes were differentially expressed in colonies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>), 46 genes were differentially expressed in F2 pools (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d-e</ref>), and 14 genes were differentially expressed in the same direction in both comparisons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Odorant receptors (ORs), a family of insect chemosensory receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">22</ref> were dramatically overrepresented among differentially expressed genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>, P&lt;0.0001).</s><s>Two other families of chemosensory genes, the ionotropic receptors (IRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">23</ref> and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">24</ref> were less enriched or not enriched, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>).</s><s>A selective role for the OR pathway in helping mosquitoes distinguish among hosts is consistent with previous work in a laboratory strain of Ae. aegypti <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">25</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Of the 14 genes significant in both colony and F2 comparisons, two were ORs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>), Or4 and Or103.</s><s>Both were upregulated in human-preferring mosquitoes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g</ref>, solid lines).</s><s>Or4 was also the second most highly expressed ligand-selective OR in the antennae of domestic females overall (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g</ref>), and we chose this gene for further study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Or4 recognises sulcatone, a component of human body odour</head><p><s>An olfactory receptor could modulate host preference by mediating attraction or repulsion to specific host odours, so we asked whether Or4 is activated by a component of human or guinea pig odour.</s><s>We expressed the genome reference allele of Or4 heterologously in a Drosophila olfactory neuron lacking a ligand-selective OR <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">26</ref> , and tested responses to fractionated host odour from guinea pigs and humans (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>Or4 did not respond to any fraction of guinea pig odour (data not shown), but responded consistently to a fraction of human odour corresponding to 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, commonly called sulcatone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Sulcatone is a volatile odorant repeatedly identified in human body odour <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[30]</ref> .</s><s>While sulcatone is also emitted by a variety of other animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[34]</ref> and plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[37]</ref> , it appears to reach uniquely high levels in humans (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c-e</ref>).</s><s>It was abundant in the odour of nylon sleeves worn by five humans but undetectable or at low concentration in unworn sleeves and sleeves worn by four guinea pigs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 c-d</ref>).</s><s>For reference, another widespread volatile, benzaldehyde, did not differ significantly between samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c-d</ref>).</s><s>We also found approximately four times more sulcatone in the body odour of live humans than in the odour of a live chicken or the hair of horses, cows, and sheep (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, these results suggest that increased expression of Or4 may help mosquitoes distinguish humans from non-human animals by conferring sensitivity to sulcatone.</s><s>Interestingly, the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae has at least 4 ORs that are strongly activated by sulcatone <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">38</ref> , but none is closely related to AaegOr4 (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">39</ref></s><s>).</s><s>These two species diverged from each other 150 million years ago and evolved to specialize in biting humans independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">40</ref> .</s></p></div>

Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Given this high level of variation, we conducted a molecular analysis to confirm that all alleles correspond to a single copy gene (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>We tested the function of each allele in Drosophila and found that A, B, C, F, and G were highly sensitive to sulcatone, while D and E were much less sensitive (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5e-f</ref>).</s><s>Variation in spontaneous activity mirrored the variation in odour-evoked activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also asked whether Or4 alleles vary in expression and could thus help explain the upregulation of this locus in human-preferring mosquitoes.</s><s>We reanalysed the RNAseq data, parsing gene expression according to major alleles in each F2 pool and normalising by allele frequency to isolate levels of allele-specific expression.</s><s>Two major conclusions emerged.</s><s>First, all alleles are expressed at higher levels when carried by human-preferring F2s than when carried by guinea pig-preferring F2s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5h</ref>, compare red to blue).</s><s>This difference suggests that a genetic element unlinked from Or4 contributes to upregulation in humanpreferring mosquitoes.</s><s>Second, the rank order of gene expression of each allele was preserved, regardless of whether it was carried by human-or guinea pig-preferring mosquitoes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5h</ref>, compare alleles within red or blue).</s><s>For example, B is always expressed at the highest level and F at the lowest level.</s><s>These consistent and significant differences among alleles suggest that genetic elements linked to Or4 and varying among alleles also contribute to changes in expression.</s></p><p><s>To determine which characteristics of Or4 alleles are tied to behaviour, we asked whether ligand-sensitivity and/or expression can account for host preference-based differential inheritance of alleles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref>).</s><s>Remarkably, both factors had significant effects on relative allele frequency in F2s and together explained 92% of the variation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5i</ref>).</s><s>This striking relationship suggests that expression and sensitivity to sulcatone have independent and additive effects on preference.</s><s>It also suggests that high levels of both are required for strong human preference.</s><s>For example, E is one of the most highly expressed alleles, yet it has weak sensitivity to sulcatone and is biased towards guinea pig-preferring mosquitoes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5i</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, allele F has high sensitivity to sulcatone, yet it is expressed at extremely low levels and is also slightly biased towards guinea pig-preferring mosquitoes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5i</ref>).</s></p></div>

amplified the full coding sequence of Or4 from each cDNA library with AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using primers designed to anneal to the 5' and 3' untranslated regions: 5'-CGGAGTTTCCTTCGTCAAGA-3' (forward), 5'-TCGACCACTCCTATACATCGC-3' (reverse).</s><s>Gel-extracted PCR amplicons (MinElute Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen) were then cloned into pCR4 using the TOPO TA

classes, 7 of which were subsequently named alleles A-G (see below).</s><s>3' RACE reactions produced no additional sequences, providing further evidence that these alleles were representative of parent colony diversity.</s></p><p><s>Or4 haplotype network and outgroup-We used the program SplitsTree4 62 to infer the haplotype network shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref> using the distance-based SplitDecomposition algorithm.</s><s>The out group sequence from Aedes albopictus was identified via blast search of allele A to an Ae.</s><s>albopictus draft genome assembly, which was partly supported by the Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2009) (Xiaoguang Chen, personal communication).</s></p><p><s>Or4 genotyping and definition of major Or4 alleles-Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing (Pacific Biosciences) of barcoded PCR amplicons was used to genotype 34 females from each parent colony and 100 -102 females from each F2 hybrid pool.</s><s>DNA was extracted from bodies (parent colonies) or single legs (F2 hybrids) using a DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen).</s><s>The individuals providing DNA were a subset of those whose antennae had been dissected for RNAseq.</s><s>We then amplified a 786 bp fragment of Or4 with KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Novagen) using barcoded primers complementary to invariant regions of the 2 nd and 3 rd coding exons: 5'-barcode-GTTGACCTATTGCGTTTTCG-3' (forward), 5'-barcode-GCACATCAGAACAGAACTTGC-3' (reverse).</s><s>The 48 forward and 48 reverse barcode sequences, provided by Pacific Biosciences, were 16 bp long and custom-paired in 92 unique combinations.</s><s>We were thus able to create 3 independent pools, each containing the purified PCR amplicons of up to 92 mosquitoes.</s><s>A sequencing library was prepared from each pool and sequenced on 1-2 SMRT cells of a Pacific Biosciences RS Sequencer by staff at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's PacBio core facility.</s><s>We obtained 20,000 -30,000 750-850 bp Circular Consensus Sequence (CCS) reads per pool.</s></p><p><s>We deconvoluted CCS read barcodes using the PacBioBarcodeIDCCS.py</s><s>python script (http://pacificbiosciences.github.com/DevNet/),</s><s>retaining only those reads with high quality assignments (barScore&gt; 38).</s><s>This resulted in an average of 158 reads per individual.</s><s>We then assigned reads to alleles via blastn search <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">63</ref> to a custom database containing the eight Or4 coding sequences cloned from cDNA.</s><s>Since SMRT sequencing has a relatively high error rate, we did not require a perfect match between reads and assigned alleles, instead simply assigning reads to the allele with the best blastn score.</s><s>Indeed, a fraction of reads from all mosquitoes had mismatches with respect to their assigned alleles, but the median number of mismatches per individual was almost always zero.</s><s>In a few cases, individuals had reads that differed from the alleles to which they had been assigned by a consistent number of mismatches, suggesting real variation rather than sequencing error.</s><s>We determined that these corresponded to rare alleles not identified by cDNA cloning and represented at a frequency of &lt; 0.1 in both parents and F2 pools and did not study them further.</s></p><p><s>The genotyping strategy described above could not differentiate two closely related alleles, subsequently named A and B (see below) that differed by a single SNP located outside the PCR amplicon.</s><s>We therefore conducted secondary genotyping on all parent and F2 mosquitoes that were shown to carry one of these two alleles (n = 152).</s><s>For each individual, we used a LightScanner (Idaho Technology Inc.) to characterize the melting curves of a 196 bp PCR amplicon from a 3'-blocked, unlabelled, 21 bp oligonucleotide probe complementary to allele B in the region surrounding the diagnostic SNP.</s><s>Melting curves were characteristic to genotype, allowing easy discrimination of individuals carrying 0, 1, or 2 copies of allele B. Reactions were prepared and analysed according to manufacturer instructions using the following primers and probe: 5'-CAAGGTCTTGCAAATGATCGGTAA-3' (forward), 5'-CGATGTTGATGATCTGACCGAAA-3' (reverse), 5'-AAGTCCAGTTCCGGTTTCGTGamino-modifier-'3' (probe).</s></p><p><s>Seven of the 8 full-length Or4 alleles cloned from cDNA were present at a frequency of ≥ 0.1 in at least one parent colony or F2 hybrid pool.</s><s>We defined these as major alleles and named them A through G in order of increasing distance from the genome reference allele A, and deposited them in GenBank (accession numbers KF801614-KF801615 and KF801617-KF801621).</s><s>The 8 th allele discovered by cDNA cloning was present at a frequency of &lt; 0.1 and was not studied further.</s></p><p><s>We quantified the relative frequency of each major allele in F2 hybrids using a frequency index equal to frequency in human-preferring F2s minus frequency in guinea pig-preferring F2s divided by the sum of the frequencies in the two types of F2s.</s></p><p><s>Confirmation of Or4 as a single copy gene-The Ae. aegypti reference genome contains another olfactory receptor, named Or5, that is 96% identical to the Or4 gene across the coding sequence, leading to a predicted Or5 protein that is 97% identical to the Or4 protein.</s><s>Although we did not sample any sequences identical to Or5 in our field-derived colonies, some of the alleles we sampled were more similar to Or5 than to Or4, raising the possibility that they actually belong to this second hypothetical locus.</s><s>To confirm that all sampled alleles segregate at a single locus, we reanalysed our PacBio genotyping data, focusing on the number of alleles carried by individual mosquitoes.</s><s>As described above, we amplified a diagnostic segment of Or4/Or5 from the genomic DNA of 270 females and sequenced ~150 pieces of DNA from each resulting amplicon.</s><s>The reads for each mosquito were then assigned to alleles based on sequence.</s><s>The vast majority of reads for each mosquito corresponded to a single allele (homozygotes) or were evenly split between two alleles (heterozygotes) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>No mosquito had significant numbers of reads assigned to more than two alleles.</s><s>We conclude that Or4 is a single locus with multiple diverse alleles and suspect that the gene annotated as Or5 represents a misassembly of Or4 allelic sequences segregating within the genome reference strain.</s></p><p><s>Or4 transmembrane prediction and snake

used single sensillum recording (SSR) to characterise the spontaneous activity and odour-evoked responses of 7 major Or4 alleles heterologously expressed in Drosophila ab3A olfactory sensory neurons.</s><s>Recordings were conducted as described previously 41 using 5 -11 day old females and a modified method for immobilizing the third antennal segment.</s><s>We glued a small wedge-shaped plastic Lego piece (rectangular footprint 15 mm × 10 mm with angled surface rising at 45° to 10 mm above base) to a glass microscope slide such that a coverslip affixed to its upper face with double stick tape would protrude upwards at a fixed angle of 45°.</s><s>We then immobilised the fly in a pipette tip mounted on a ball of dental wax opposite the coverslip as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">66</ref> .</s><s>After bringing the base of the fly's antennae into contact with the edge of the coverslip, we used two small drops of UV glue (KOA 300, Kexmert) to secure the rim of the cut pipette tip on either side of the protruding fly head to the edge of the coverslip and cured it for 10 s with a 405 nm violet laser pointer.</s><s>We then used a glass micropipette to gently lower one antenna towards the angled coverslip until the arista contacted a small drop of UV glue placed directly below, and immediately cured the glue with the laser.</s><s>These modifications prevented the fly preparation and antenna from drifting away from the coverslip over the course of a recording.</s><s>Neither transgenic nor wild type ab3 sensilla responded to the odour of the glue.</s></p><p><s>We prepared serial dilutions of sulcatone (C.A.S. 409-02-9, Sigma Aldrich) v/v in paraffin oil and loaded 30 μl aliquots into odour delivery pipettes on the day of recording as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">66</ref> .</s><s>During recording, we applied a continuous stream of charcoal-filtered air to the insect antenna.</s><s>For each stimulus, we first cleared the odour delivery pipette of accumulated volatiles by redirecting a fraction of the air stream through it and away from the preparation for a 1 s pulse.</s><s>Fifteen seconds later, we then delivered the stimulus by redirecting air through the pipette for another 1 s pulse, but this time with the tip inserted back into the air stream flowing over the antenna.</s><s>We used each pipette no more than twice.</s></p><p><s>We applied dilutions to a single ab3 sensillum per fly in the following order: solvent, 10 -7 , 10 -6 , 10 -5 , 10 -4 , 10 -3 , 10 -2 .</s><s>To increase resolution for the most biologically relevant doses, we sometimes stimulated a second sensillum on the same fly with 10 -5 and 10 -4 dilutions only.</s><s>Final sample sizes were n = 13 -17 sensilla per genotype for 10 -5 and 10 -4 and n = 8 -10 sensilla per genotype for solvent and all other dilutions.</s><s>We identified ab3 sensilla by size, location on the antenna, lack of A cell response to the ab2A ligand ethyl acetate (10 -2 ) (C.A.S. 141-78-6, Sigma Aldrich), and strong B cell response to its cognate ligand, 2heptanone(10 -4 ) 67 (C.A.S. 110-43-0, Sigma Aldrich).</s><s>We confirmed the Dhalo/Dhalo genotype of each fly by lack of A cell response to ethyl hexanoate (10 -4 ) (C.A.S. 123-66-0, Sigma Aldrich).</s></p><p><s>We recorded and processed neuronal activity using AutoSpike software (Syntech).</s><s>Spontaneous activity was averaged over a 14 s period for each sensillum.</s><s>Evoked response was calculated by subtracting average spontaneous activity in the 3 s before stimulus onset from average activity in the 1 s after stimulus onset.</s><s>The distance air travels through the odour delivery system causes a delay between digitally recorded onset and the time the stimulus reaches the antenna.</s><s>We therefore defined stimulus onset on the basis of the excitatory response elicited in the ab3B cell by 10 -2 sulcatone; this invariably occurred at 200 ms after the computer-recorded onset.</s><s>We compared spontaneous and evoked activity across fly genotypes using 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test.</s><s>We fit monotone cubic splines to evoked response data
