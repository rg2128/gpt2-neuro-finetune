important in olfaction, and how they are processed by the olfactory system.</s><s>The relationship between odor structure (chemical space), the spatial and temporal patterns of activity in the brain

molecules.</s></p><p><s>Even the earliest step in olfaction, the interaction between a particular OR and ligands (odorants) has defied simple descriptions.</s><s>Since the olfactory system derives percepts on the basis of responses of a large number of odorant receptor (ORs) types, the number of dimensions of the odor space could be large.</s><s>Nonetheless, recent studies, using dimensionality reduction methods suggest that a relatively small number of odor physicalchemical descriptors (~30 out of ~1,600 to ~5,000 in the Dragon database <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> ) capture odor

explained by considering low dimensional manifolds (~2-20), with dimensions related to behaviorally relevant features such as stimulus pleasantness, toxicity and/or hydrophobicity <ref type="bibr"

spatial layout and wiring patterns of neural circuits can offer important clues about the underlying computations -for example, a retinotopic organization along with nearest neighbor interactions allowed the inference of local contrast enhancement in the retina <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>In the vertebrate olfactory system, there is a reproducible and precise layout of OR identity in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb (OB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>However, how this receptor-based layout translates to a functional map remains unclear <ref

to a set of commonly used 1,666 physical-chemical odor properties.</s><s>We asked four questions.</s><s>First, how well are these physical-chemical properties of odors captured by the glomerular and MTC responses?</s><s>Second, does similarity of odor molecules in the physical-chemical properties space correlate with the similarity of neuronal population responses?</s><s>Third, does the physical

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We used imaging of intrinsic signals from the dorsal surface of the OB to probe the responses of glomeruli (n=5 mice, 10 bulb hemispheres/fields of view, 871 glomeruli) to an array of chemically diverse odors (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Methods).</s><s>Previous reports indicate that glomerular intrinsic signals approximate well the activity of presynaptic olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) terminals in the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>In separate experiments, we employed multiphoton microscopy to monitor the responses (GCaMP3/6, Methods) of mitral and tufted cells tilling the dorsal aspect of the bulb (n=8 mice, 13 hemispheres, 19 fields of view, 1,711 M/T somata, Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) to the same stimuli in awake mice across a range of concentration (Methods).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Odor responses of glomeruli and MTCs are poorly described by Dragon physical-chemical properties</head><p><s>Previous studies suggested that the olfactory system is tuned to extract specific physicalchemical features of odors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Here, we investigated whether a wide array of physicalchemical molecular parameters are good predictors of glomerular and MTC responses.</s><s>We used the Dragon database <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> to evaluate 1,666 physical-chemical properties to each odor in the panel.</s><s>The responsiveness of each glomerular or MTC region of interest (ROI) to a particular property (called here the property response) was characterized as a Pearson's correlation between the odor responses of the ROI and the values taken by the property (property strength vector, PSV) across the 49 monomolecular odors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a-c, Methods</ref>).</s><s>The array of such correlations across the Dragon molecular properties is defined as the property response spectrum of that ROI (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>This definition is analogous to calculating a neuronal receptive field in the visual or auditory systems, where the response strength of a given cell is correlated with certain stimulus features.</s><s>The property response spectrum represents the strength of individual ROI response to an array of physical-chemical properties, thus playing the role of a molecular receptive field.</s></p><p><s>For both glomeruli and MTCs, the number of properties that single units responded to significantly (false discovery rate, FDR, q&lt;0.1 for the property response spectrum of each ROI considered, Methods) varied from ROI to ROI, with an average of 12.7 per glomerulus and 16.4 properties per MTC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>In general, individual responsive glomeruli and MTCs were only poorly tuned to the physical-chemical properties (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>; ~26% of glomeruli and ~33% of MTCs showed no significant correlations), and the vast majority of glomerular and cell odor response-property correlation pairs was not significant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>-i, Methods).</s><s>Within the subset of significant glomerular and cell odor response-property pairs (~6%), correlations spanned both negative and positive values (absolute average: 0.35±0.07</s><s>STD for glomeruli and 0.36±0.08</s><s>STD for MTCs, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>).</s><s>Across different experiments, the tuning widths (number of significant properties per ROI) were similar (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We further used principal component analysis (PCA) to quantify the dimensionality of three data types that describe the physical and neuronal odor representations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1j,</ref><ref type="figure">k,</ref><ref type="figure">l</ref>).</s><s>Approximately 17 dimensions were sufficient to account for 90% of variance in the values taken by Dragon molecular properties (PSV) across the 49 odors used (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1l</ref>).</s><s>Thus, many of these properties are redundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , and a 17D flat surface contains substantial amount of information (90%) on the molecular properties.</s><s>The dimensionality of the physical-chemical descriptors depends on the odors included in the panel, and, in principle, can be independent of the responses of olfactory neurons.</s><s>In comparison, the responses of glomeruli to odors in our panel could be described within a 21D principal components (PC) space, and those of the MTCs in a 24D space at the same level of variance explained (90%, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>We iteratively sampled increasing number of odors (up to 49, Methods) and observed that the dimensionality of the molecular properties, glomerular and MTC responses increased steadily.</s><s>Thus, the quantities reported here represent lower bounds on these metrics of odor space.</s><s>MTC responses generally had higher dimensionality than glomerular responses, consistent with previous reports of decorrelation of glomerular inputs within the bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>Do neuronal responses represent Dragon molecular properties efficiently?</s><s>We used a computational technique we call principal component exchange (PCX), and projected the molecular properties (PSV) into the PCA space of neuronal responses (glomerular or mitral, Methods).</s><s>We then computed the variance of molecular properties data captured by the neuronal responses PC space of increasing dimensionality (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>If the molecular and neuronal responses PC spaces were identical, then glomerular (or mitral cell) PCs would capture the same fraction of variance in both neuronal responses and the molecular properties datasets.</s><s>Instead, we find that glomerular and respectively mitral cell responses PCs explain almost the same fraction of variance in the molecular properties dataset as they do in randomly generated data (Methods, grey and black lines, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>When projected to the PC space of molecular properties, glomerular and mitral (same for tufted, data not shown) cell responses, were also similar to random data controls in terms of amount of variance explained (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1l</ref>).</s><s>To better characterize the performance of PCX, we used surrogate data in which a known relationship is embedded.</s><s>We systematically perturbed the glomerular odor response vectors by adding variable known amounts of noise.</s><s>As expected, gradual injection of noise resulted in less-and-less variance explained by the glomerular PCs.</s><s>Corrupting the glomerular responses signal to noise ratio (SNR) by more than 5 fold led to similar amounts of variance explained as by the molecular properties (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4h</ref>).</s><s>Projecting mitral cell responses in the glomerular PC space, or glomerular responses in the mitral cells PC space captured less variance compared to the reference PC spaces (glomerular and mitral), but substantially more than random data as discussed later (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4h</ref>).</s><s>Recording glomerular responses in anaesthetized mice, or sampling MTC responses within shorter intervals (0.5s to 1.5s) from stimulus onset, led to similar results (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>Overall, our data shows that neural responses of both glomeruli and OB outputs are poorly tuned to the physical-chemical properties analyzed, and instead reflect odor features that are not well-captured by these molecular properties commonly used in computational chemistry, and by previous studies in olfaction.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Odor similarity in physical odor space is a poor predictor of neuronal representations</head><p><s>Does the similarity between pairs of odors, calculated using the set of 1,666 physicalchemical properties reflect the similarity in neuronal representations of the same odors in either the input or output layers of the OB?</s><s>To describe similarity in odor physical space, for each odor pair in the panel, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the normalized molecular properties strengths associated with each odor in the panel as proposed by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .
