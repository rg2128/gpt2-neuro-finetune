<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The spiking activity of cortical neurons is often characterized by their average response over a large number of trials, prompting a wealth of theoretical studies relating the structure of neuronal networks to their trial averaged firing rate dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> .</s><s>However, trial averages do not capture the stochastic and irregular dynamics characteristic of cortical populations and the nervous system in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, trial-to-trial fluctuations are central to contemporary theories of cortical computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> .</s><s>A deep mechanistic understanding of neuronal variability remains an open challenge.</s></p><p><s>Early theoretical studies deduced that variable spiking activity could arise through a balancing of strong, yet opposing, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> .</s><s>Expanding on this conjecture, van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> showed that networks of recurrently coupled model neurons robustly create a state where strong excitation is approximately balanced by inhibition, creating a push-pull dynamic that generates irregular spiking activity.</s><s>More recently, balanced networks have been implicated in theories of optimal coding 8 , working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> , and stimulus tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> .</s><s>Numerous experimental studies have established that excitation is often approximately balanced by inhibition in cortical circuits <ref

type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> .</s><s>In sum, balanced networks provide a parsimonious model of the irregular spiking activity observed in cortical circuits.</s></p><p><s>Early balanced network models produced asynchronous activity through sparse connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</s><s>However, several experimental studies reveal that local cortical networks are densely connected, with connection probabilities between nearby neurons sometimes exceeding 40 percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</s><s>These data imply substantial overlap between local synaptic inputs, which could, in principle, synchronize cortical networks.</s><s>However -counter to intuition -balanced networks with dense connectivity show weak spike train correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s><s>This "asynchronous state" results from the correlated excitatory (e) or inhibitory (i) afferents to neuron pairs being actively cancelled by a strong negative e-i correlation establishing weak correlations even when connectivity is not sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Consistent with the predicted asynchronous state, some multi-unit extracellular recordings show noise correlations that are nearly zero on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</s><s>However, a majority of population recordings in cortex reveal comparatively large correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> .</s><s>Several studies suggest that the magnitude of noise correlations is dependent on many factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> , including arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> , attention 29 , anesthetic state 23,24,30,31 and cortical layer 32,33 .</s><s>Finally, while in vivo whole cell recordings reveal strong positive e-e and i-i correlations coexisting with strong e-i correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> , these correlation sources do not always perfectly cancel as predicted by some theoretical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, these studies show that cortical circuits can exhibit both weak and moderate noise correlations, at odds with predictions from the current theory of balanced networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In this study, we generalize the theory of correlations in densely connected balanced networks to include the widely observed dependence of synaptic connection probability on distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s><s>We show that spatially broad recurrent projections disrupt the asynchronous state, producing a signature spatial correlation structure: Nearby pairs of neurons are positively correlated on average, pairs at intermediate distances are negatively correlated and distant pairs are weakly correlated.</s><s>These positive and negative correlations cancel so that the average correlation between pairs sampled randomly over a large range of distances is nearly zero.</s><s>We uncover this non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance in recordings from superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex, but only after correcting for a latent source of shared fluctuations.</s><s>Our findings decouple balanced excitation and inhibition from asynchronous network activity, greatly extending the applicability of balanced network theory to explain cortical dynamics.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We consider a network of excitatory and inhibitory exponential integrate-and-fire model neurons.</s><s>Neurons provide recurrent, lateral synaptic input to one another and receive feedforward synaptic input from a non-local presynaptic population.</s><s>A detailed mathematical analysis of correlations in the limit of large network size is provided in Supplementary Note S.1 and Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>.</s><s>Below, we provide an outline of these theoretical results and confirm their predictions using computer simulations.</s><s>We first use a simplified network model to demonstrate how the asynchronous state considered in previous theoretical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> is broken by heterogeneous input correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s><s>We then consider a more realistic model where neurons belong to a continuous spatial domain and connection probability depends on distance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Homogeneous input correlations are cancelled by balanced networks</head><p><s>To demonstrate the mechanisms affecting correlations in recurrent networks, we first simulated a simplified network of N=20,000 neurons (half excitatory and half inhibitory) that all receive the same fluctuating feedforward input and are each connected with probability 0.25 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>Despite the fact that neuron pairs share all of their feedforward input and 25% of their recurrent synaptic input on average, spiking activity was asynchronous, with an average pairwise spike count correlation of 6.8×10 -5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>This small average correlation is a defining characteristic of the asynchronous state.</s><s>Mathematically, this state is realized when spike count covariances in the network satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> where C SS denotes the average spike count covariance between pairs of neurons in the recurrent network, N is the number of neurons in the network and O(1/N) denotes asymptotic proportionality to 1/N for large N. Note that covariance and correlation scale identically with network size in balanced networks, so we discuss them interchangeably <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Our theoretical analysis proceeds by noting that spike count covariance is inherited from synaptic input covariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> and therefore the two scale similarly with N in the asynchronous state, where C II denotes the average covariance between neurons' synaptic inputs.</s><s>Synaptic inputs can be decomposed into their feedforward and recurrent sources, I=F+R, so that neurons' input covariances decompose as where C FF is the average covariance between neurons' feedforward input currents, C RR between their recurrent inputs and C RF between one neuron's recurrent and the other neuron's feedforward synaptic input.</s><s>Recurrent synaptic input, R, is composed of positive contributions from lateral excitatory synaptic inputs and negative contributions from inhibitory (R=e-i).</s></p><p><s>Shared input fluctuations are visualized by averaging the inputs to several neurons, so that the unshared contributions average out (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>).</s><s>Overlapping inputs cause C FF and C RR to be positive (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref> -the blue and red curves have large fluctuations).</s><s>If feedforward input correlation is moderate, C FF ~O(1), then recurrent input tracks the feedforward input so that C RF is negative and nearly perfectly cancels the positive sources of correlations (i.e., 2C RF =-(C FF +C RR )+O(1/N); see Supplementary Note S.1).</s><s>As a result, the covariance between the total synaptic inputs is weak, C II ~O(1/N), (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref> -the black curve has small fluctuations).</s><s>This cancellation arises naturally in the balanced state and does not require a precise tuning of model parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s><s>Since spiking correlations are inherited from synaptic input covariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> , this cancellation of input covariances leads to small, O(1/N), spike count correlations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heterogeneous input correlations can disrupt the asynchronous state</head><p><s>To study the impact of heterogeneity on correlations in balanced networks, we modified the above model by dividing the neurons into two populations.</s><s>Each population received a separate feedforward input (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>).</s><s>The two feedforward input sources were statistically identical but uncorrelated.</s><s>Recurrent connectivity was not changed: Neurons were randomly connected without respect to population membership (identical to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>This input heterogeneity dramatically changed the structure of correlations in the network.</s><s>Pairs of neurons in the same population had strongly positive spike count correlations on average (0.34), while neuron pairs from opposite populations were negatively correlated with a nearly identical correlation magnitude (-0.34), and the average correlation between all pairs was nearly zero (4.2×10 -4 ; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The mechanism responsible for this change in correlations can be understood by again separating the synaptic input covariance into its recurrent and feedforward sources, but generalizing the decomposition to account for neuron "distance" to obtain (1)   Here, C II (d) is the average covariance between input currents to pairs of neurons separated by distance d where d=0 for neurons in the same population and d=1 for opposite population pairs, and similarly for the other terms.</s><s>Feedforward input is only correlated between neurons in the same population, so C FF (0)&gt;0, but C FF (1)=0.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, recurrent connections do not respect population membership and thus neither do the statistics of recurrent input, Since covariances C RR (d) and C RF (d) do not depend on d, but C FF (d) does, cancellation cannot be achieved in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) for both d=1 and d=0 simultaneously.</s><s>In other words, the one "copy" of shared recurrent synaptic input cannot cancel both versions of the feedforward synaptic inputs.</s><s>The loss of cancellation causes the total synaptic current shared by neurons in the same population to inherit shared fluctuations from their feedforward inputs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1h</ref>; compare blue and black), giving rise to positive O(1) correlations between samepopulation pairs.</s><s>A competitive dynamic introduces negative correlations between neurons in opposite populations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>,g).</s><s>A similar mechanism was considered in a recent theoretical study <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s></p><p><s>For illustrative purposes, we considered a simplified network model with discrete subpopulations, but correlations and connectivity in many cortical circuits depend on continuous quantities like physical distance or tuning similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s><s>Next, we generalize these findings to more biologically realistic networks with connection probabilities that depend on neuron distance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A spatially extended network model</head><p><s>We next considered a network of N e =40,000 excitatory and N i =10,000 inhibitory model neurons arranged on a square-shaped domain modeling a portion of a cortical layer.</s><s>The neurons receive feedforward synaptic input from a separate layer of Poisson-spiking neurons and are connected with a probability that decays with distance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, the probability of a connection between two neurons in the recurrent network obeys where d is the distance between the neurons measured along the two-dimensional network, ~ denotes proportionality, g(d;σ 2 )~exp(-d 2 /(2σ 2 )) is a Gaussian-shaped function and α rec approximately represents the average length of a recurrent synaptic projection.</s><s>Similarly, the probability of a synaptic projection from a neuron in the feedforward layer to a neuron in the recurrent layer decays with distance like a Gaussian with width parameter α ffwd , where distance is measured parallel to the cortical surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s>We next show that the asynchronous state is realized when α rec &lt;α ffwd , then show that the asynchronous state cannot be realized when α rec &gt;α ffwd .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The asynchronous state in spatially extended cortical circuits</head><p><s>As above, asynchronous spiking requires a cancellation between input covariances, cf.</s><s>Eq.
