<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIP interneuron activity increases in the open arms of the EPM.</head><p><s>To efficiently measure VIP interneuron activity during EPM exploration, we used fiber photometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cui et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gunaydin et al., 2014)</ref> in the widely studied VIP-Cre line <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Batista-Brito et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kamigaki and Dan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Khoshkhoo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pfeffer et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pi et al., 2013)</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1A</ref>).</s><s>VIP-Cre mice were injected with adenoassociated-virus (AAV1) encoding Cre-dependent GCaMP6s in mPFC.</s><s>A fiber for transmitting and collecting excitation and emission wavelengths was implanted above the site of virus injection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1B</ref>).</s><s>Two weeks after surgery, mice explored the EPM while we measured VIP-GCaMP signals.</s><s>VIP-GCaMP signals were higher in the center and open arms than the closed arms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1C-D</ref>), and closely tracked movement into the center or open arms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1E</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S1A</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, although VIP interneuron activity can be linked to the speed of locomotion in the open field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S1B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fu et al., 2014)</ref>, we did not find a relationship between speed and prefrontal VIP GCaMP signals in the EPM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S1C-D</ref>).</s><s>This may reflect the fact that mice did not run as fast in the EPM as in the open field.</s></p><p><s>We also used fiber photometry to measure signals from parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SOM) interneurons.</s><s>Both PV-GCaMP and SOM-GCaMP signals were also higher in the open than closed arms.</s><s>However, the encoding of EPM location (open vs. closed arms) was significantly stronger for VIP-GCaMP signals, than for PV-GCaMP or SOM-GCaMP signals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIP interneuron activity predicts future open arm avoidance vs. exploration.</head><p><s>Several models could explain our finding that VIP interneuron activity is higher in the center and open arms than closed arms.</s><s>One is that VIP interneuron activity drives open arm exploration.</s><s>Alternatively, VIP interneuron activity might represent an anxiety-related signal that promotes open arm avoidance.</s><s>In the latter model, other signals presumably drive exploration, such that decisions to explore vs. avoid reflect a competition between these proexploratory signals and VIP activity-driven avoidance.</s><s>In this case, exploration would occur when exploratory signals outpace increases in VIP interneuron-driven avoidance signals during approaches to the center or open arms.</s><s>A final possibility is that VIP activity does not influence or predict choices to explore vs. avoid the open arms, but is simply a readout of EPM location.</s></p><p><s>First, to test whether VIP activity predicts subsequent exploration vs. avoidance, we identified all runs from a closed arm to the center, then classified each according to whether the mouse subsequently avoided or explored the open arms <ref type="bibr">(closed-center-closed vs. closedcenter-open runs)</ref>.</s><s>VIP-GCaMP signals in the center chamber were significantly lower for closed-center-open than closed-center-closed runs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2A</ref>).</s><s>We also looked further back in time, comparing VIP-GCaMP signals in the closed arm, prior to entry into the center.</s><s>Again, lower VIP-GCaMP signals predicted subsequent open arm exploration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2B</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibiting VIP interneurons reduces open arm avoidance.</head><p><s>The preceding suggests that low vs. high VIP activity as mice approach the center chamber promotes subsequent open arm exploration vs. avoidance, respectively.</s><s>We used optogenetics to directly test this hypothesized causal relationship.</s><s>Bilateral fiber optics were implanted into the mPFC of VTP-Cre mice injected with Cre-dependent archaerhodopsin (AAV5-DIO-eArch3.0-eYFP;</s><s>Arch) or eYFP (AAV5-DIO-eYFP) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3A</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed that Arch reliably inhibited VIP interneurons in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref>).</s><s>Because VIP-GCaMP signals specifically increased in the center and open arms, we delivered 532nm light to the mPFC whenever mice were within a "stimulation zone," comprising the center, open arms, and a small portion of the closed arms abutting the center.</s><s>We then compared behavior during three, 3-minute-long epochs: light OFF, followed by light ON (i.e., light was delivered only in the stimulation zone), and finally light OFF again (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3C</ref>).</s><s>We quantified light-induced changes in open arm avoidance vs. exploration via three analyses.</s><s>First, during the light ON epoch, there was a significant increase in relative time spent in the open arms and open arm entries for VIP-Arch mice compared to VIP-eYFP cohorts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3D</ref>).</s><s>There was also a corresponding decrease in closed arm entries for VIP-Arch mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3B</ref>).</s><s>Second, the change in time spent in the open arms in the light ON epoch compared to the preceding light OFF epoch was significantly greater for VIP-Arch mice (% change in open arm time: 176 ± 64%) than VIP-eYFP cohorts (32 ± 30%) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3E</ref>).</s><s>Third, time spent in the open arms was significantly greater in the light ON epoch than the preceding light OFF epoch for VIP-Arch mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3F</ref>) but not for VIP-eYFP controls.</s><s>Interestingly, in VIP-Arch mice, open arm entries remained elevated during the light OFF epoch following the light ON epoch (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3D</ref>).</s><s>Inhibiting VIP interneurons did not affect distance travelled in the EPM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3C</ref>).</s><s>Also notable is that inhibiting VIP interneurons did not affect open arm exploration when light was delivered continuously throughout a 3-minute epoch (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3D</ref>), rather than triggered by entries into the center or open arms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3E-G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The focus of this study is on how VIP interneurons contribute to a specific behavior (open arm avoidance), rather than on how they contribute to the multifaceted entity of "anxiety" more generally.</s><s>That being said, optogenetic inhibition of VIP interneurons did attenuate other "anxiety-related" behaviors in the marble-burying and light-dark box tests (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3H  -I</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIP interneurons disinhibit prefrontal responses to hippocampal input.</head><p><s>Given that VIP interneuron activity increases in the open arms and contributes to open arm avoidance, we decided to explore the relationship between prefrontal VIP interneurons and inputs arriving from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC).</s><s>vHPC inputs to mPFC differentially encode the open vs. closed arms of the EPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ciocchi et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, mPFC neurons which encode the open vs. closed arms phase-lock to the vHPC theta rhythm suggesting they receive strong input from this source <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adhikari et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, inhibiting vHPC-mPFC projections suppresses single-unit mPFC activity that is specific for the open vs. closed arms, and reduces open arm avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Based on this, we hypothesized that mPFC VIP interneurons might be recruited by vHPC input and regulate prefrontal responses to that input.</s><s>To test this, we first confirmed that mPFC VIP interneurons receive direct monosynaptic input from vHPC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S4A-B</ref>).</s><s>We recorded from mPFC VIP interneurons while stimulating ChR2 in vHPC terminals, and observed EPSCs in VIP interneurons in the presence of TTX (1 uM) + 4-AP (0.1 mM), which isolates monosynaptic responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Petreanu et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Next, to test how mPFC VIP interneurons regulate prefrontal responses to vHPC input, we recorded from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in acute mPFC slices from VIP-Cre mice injected with two viruses: one to drive Cre-dependent expression of halorhodopsin (VIP-eNpHR) in the mPFC, and a second to express ChR2 in vHPC projection neurons.</s><s>This enabled us to stimulate ChR2 in vHPC terminals with blue light flashes (5 ms at 10 Hz), with or without concomitant optogenetic inhibition of VIP interneurons (vHPC-ChR2; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>).</s><s>Once again, optogenetic stimulation of vHPC terminals elicited excitatory synaptic responses in VIP interneurons; we also confirmed that simultaneous eNpHR stimulation hyperpolarizes VIP interneurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S4C</ref>).</s><s>Spiking of layer 2/3 mPFC neurons in response to vHPC input was reduced when we simultaneously inhibited VIP interneurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B</ref>, left).</s><s>Repeating these experiments in voltage clamp revealed that inhibiting VIP interneurons significantly increases inhibitory synaptic currents evoked by optogenetic stimulation of vHPC terminals, but has no effect on excitatory currents (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4C</ref>).</s><s>Thus, VIP interneurons normally disinhibit mPFC responses to vHPC input.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibiting VIP interneurons disrupts prefrontal representations of the open arms.</head><p><s>Given that they disinhibit vHPC-mPFC inputs which transmit information about whether mice are in the open vs. closed arms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adhikari et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ciocchi et al., 2015)</ref>, we wondered whether prefrontal VIP interneurons might be necessary for prefrontal representations of the open vs. closed arms.</s><s>To test this, we had to first identify patterns of prefrontal network activity which encode the open vs. closed arms, then determine how these are altered when we inhibit prefrontal VIP neurons.</s><s>For this, we employed a dual-color microendoscope (nVoke, Inscopix) for combined GCaMP imaging of mPFC activity and activation of eNpHR in VIP interneurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5A-C</ref>).</s><s>We expressed GCaMP nonspecifically in mPFC neurons using the synapsin promoter; eNpHR expression was restricted to VIP interneurons using a Cre-dependent virus in VIP-Cre mice (Methods).</s><s>Importantly, cross-activation of inhibitory photocurrents by wavelengths used to excite GCaMP was relatively low (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To specifically characterize network-level activity patterns, including potential nonlinear interactions between different neurons, we computed the (time-varying) matrix of correlations between signals from different neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5B</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, for each pair of presumed neurons, we calculated the normalized vector dot product between the time series of GCaMP signals from one neuron and the time series of derivatives of the GCaMP signal from the other.</s><s>We computed correlations between GCaMP signals and derivatives, instead of just between pairs of GCaMP signals, to minimize autocorrelations driven by shared background fluorescence.</s><s>The rationale for this is that the integral of a signal with its derivative is zero over a closed path (for any signal that is differentiable in time).</s><s>Thus, autocorrelation due to shared background fluorescence, which is proportional to the dot product between the background signal and its derivative, should be approximately zero.</s><s>To verify that this approach works in practice, we analyzed a surrogate dataset (using the same parameters we used for our actual analysis).</s><s>Each surrogate dataset signal was composed of an experimentally measured GCaMP signal, shifted in time by a random amount to make the signals independent from each other.</s><s>Then we added a common signal (scaled by a random factor between -1 and 1) to each surrogate dataset signal to model shared background fluorescence.</s><s>Correlations between signals in this surrogate dataset were much larger in magnitude than correlations between signals and their derivatives (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5C</ref>, left).</s><s>We observed a similar difference for correlation distributions obtained from real data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5C</ref>, right).</s><s>Thus, computing correlations between GCaMP signals and their derivatives, as we have done, rather than between the signals themselves, minimizes the magnitude of correlations between signals that are nominally independent but include a component representing shared background fluorescence.</s><s>As a result, this approach should make it easier to resolve physiologically meaningful correlations.</s><s>Another rationale for using the derivatives of GCaMP signals to characterize network state, is that these derivatives can be more informative about neuronal firing than the GCaMP signals themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Markowitz et al., 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Using this approach, we divided each dataset into 2.5 sec epochs, calculated the correlation matrix (between GCaMP signals and the derivatives of GCaMP signals) during each epoch, and classified each epoch based on whether the mouse was in the closed or open arms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5B</ref>).</s><s>This allowed us to determine whether patterns of prefrontal network activity, i.e., correlation matrices, correlate with EPM behavior.</s><s>Indeed, every pattern of correlations observed during an open arm epoch was more similar to other patterns of correlations observed during different open arm epochs, than to patterns observed during closed arm epochs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5E</ref>).</s><s>Left open arm correlations were also more similar to right open arm correlations than to closed arm correlations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5D</ref>, top), confirming that these correlations encode anxiety-related (as opposed to purely spatial) information.</s><s>Importantly, this was not simply due to open arm epochs being close together in time.</s><s>To show this, we time-shifted all epochs by a fixed amount, persevering their relative timing but shuffling their associated labels (i.e.</s><s>open vs. closed arms).</s><s>In time-shifted data, there was no difference between the left-right open arm correlation similarity and the left open arm-closed arm correlation similarity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5D,</ref><ref type="figure">bottom</ref>).</s><s>This finding also validates our analytical approach, because it shows that the correlation matrices we computed carry information about whether the mouse is in the open vs. closed arms.</s></p><p><s>We then evaluated how inhibiting VIP interneurons affects this encoding of the open vs. closed arms.</s><s>Strikingly, differences in correlations between the open and closed arms were attenuated when we inhibited VIP interneurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5F-G</ref>), consistent with the behavioral effect of such inhibition to attenuate the preference for the closed vs. open arms.</s><s>Importantly, only the magnitude of changes in correlations between the open vs. closed arms was altered by inhibiting VIP interneurons; the magnitude of correlations themselves was not different (p = 1 by sign-rank test).</s><s>In fact, when looking on a mouse-by-mouse basis, we found a striking correlation between the degree to which VIP interneuron inhibition attenuates closed vs. open arm differences in correlations, and the degree to which that inhibition attenuates open arm avoidance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5H</ref>; this analysis controlled for potential sampling bias caused by different amounts of open arm exploration across mice by analyzing the same number of open or closed arm time bins in all mice).</s><s>Taken together, these results demonstrate that it is in fact useful to characterize the current state of the prefrontal microcircuit by calculating the matrix of correlations between GCaMP signals and their derivatives, as we have done.</s><s>Network state, defined in this way, encodes anxietyrelated information about whether mice are currently in the open vs. closed arms, and more importantly, predicts the change in open arm exploration that results from inhibiting VIP interneurons.</s></p><p><s>To delve deeper into this finding, we measured how inhibiting VIP interneurons affected either GCaMP signals or their derivatives in individual neurons.</s><s>For this, we computed each neuron's "preference index" during the initial light off period and subsequent light on period (Methods).</s><s>A preference index of 1 or -1 indicates that activity (either GCaMP signals or their derivatives) were consistently higher in the closed or open arms, respectively; 0 indicates that activity was equal in the two chambers.</s><s>For GCaMP signals, inhibiting VIP interneurons did not significantly alter the distribution of preference indices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5E</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adhikari et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ciocchi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, one model is that inhibiting prefrontal VIP interneurons should only affect open arm avoidance when the vHPC actively transmits information to mPFC, i.e., when vHPC-mPFC communication is strong.</s><s>An alternative is that prefrontal VIP interneurons make the mPFC more sensitive to weak vHPC input, such that inhibiting prefrontal VIP interneurons selectively impacts open arm avoidance when vHPC-mPFC communication is weak.</s><s>A third possibility is that prefrontal VIP interneurons regulate open arm avoidance independent of vHPC input to mPFC, i.e., inhibiting VIP interneurons decreases open arm avoidance regardless of whether vHPC-mPFC communication is strong vs. weak.</s><s>These models are schematized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6A</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To distinguish between these models and test whether the role of VIP interneurons in open arm avoidance depends on the current state of the vHPC-mPFC network, we measured vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony during periods of EPM exploration +/-inhibition of VIP interneurons.</s><s>Theta-frequency synchronization is a marker for communication between vHPC and mPFC, particularly in anxiety-provoking environments such as the EPM <ref type="bibr"

electrode was attached to one side of a bilateral fiber optic implant to record while stimulating Arch in VIP interneurons using the same location-based method described earlier.</s><s>First, we tested whether inhibiting VIP interneurons directly alters vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony.</s><s>For this we separated runs which entered the stimulation zone based on whether they exhibited dips or peaks in vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony at specific timepoints.</s><s>Specifically, at each timepoint we z-scored vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony relative to the rest of the run.</s><s>Then we separated runs based on whether this z-scored vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony was in the first (bottom), second, third, or fourth (top) quartile (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure"

immediate changes in theta synchrony.</s></p><p><s>Next, we examined whether inhibiting VIP interneurons increases open arm exploration under all conditions, or only when vHPC-mPFC communication is strong or weak, i.e., when the z-scored theta synchrony is in the top or bottom quartile, respectively.</s><s>For this we plotted the fraction of runs which avoid vs. explore the open arms as a function of quartile and light ON vs. OFF.</s><s>When we inhibited VIP interneurons (light ON), we observed a dramatic increase in the fraction of top quartile runs (relatively high theta synchrony) that explored the open arms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6D</ref>).</s><s>In fact, the majority of such runs now explored the open arms.</s><s>By contrast, there was no significant change in the fraction of runs in the bottom quartile -those associated with dips in theta synchrony -which explored the open arms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6C</ref>).</s><s>We also did not see a significant change in open arm runs for the second or third quartiles of theta synchrony (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, inhibiting VIP interneurons only increases open arm exploration when vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony increases, which presumably reflects the transmission of anxiety-related information from vHPC to mPFC.</s><s>By contrast, when theta synchrony dips (and vHPC-mPFC input is presumably not contributing to open arm avoidance), inhibiting VIP interneurons has no effect on open arm exploration.</s></p><p><s>As a control, we also identified runs based on the top quartile of delta (1-4 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), or gamma (low: 30-58 Hz; high: 62-120 Hz) synchrony.</s><s>In these cases, light delivery did not significantly alter the relative number of open vs. closed arm runs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6C</ref>).</s><s>These results show that VIP interneurons are recruited by, and powerfully modulate, a behavior widely studied because of its presumed relevance to anxiety.</s><s>In particular, our findings that VIP activity in the EPM does not correlate with running speed, but that VIP activity in a single location (the closed arm) differs based on future behavior (whether mice explore vs. avoid the open arms when they subsequently enter the center), suggests that VIP interneurons encode behavioral state, not just sensorimotor signals.</s><s>Our findings also show that VIP interneurons disinhibit cortical responses to a particular source of input, are necessary for network-level representations

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>There are multiple possible reasons why inhibiting VIP interneurons might decrease open arm avoidance.</s><s>This manipulation might make mice unable to differentiate the open vs. closed arms, reduce physiological measures of anxiety (e.g., elevated heart rate), or simply cause mice to ignore those anxiety signals as they make decisions about whether to explore vs. avoid.</s><s>Notably, inhibiting VIP interneurons while mice are exploring the EPM causes an increase in open arm exploration which outlasts the period of inhibition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3D</ref>).</s><s>If inhibiting VIP interneurons simply renders mice unaware of whether they are in the open or closed arms, then it is hard to imagine why this would lead to long-lasting changes in open arm avoidance.</s><s>Future experiments could address whether inhibiting VIP interneurons reduces physiological measures of anxiety or causes mice to ignore those signals by measuring the effects of inhibiting VIP interneurons on variables such as heart rate.</s><s>In addition, most of our behavioral experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>-3) used male mice only.</s><s>Other behavioral experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>) used male and female mice, but in these cases, group sizes were too small to examine possible sex differences.</s><s>These could be evaluated by future experiments.</s></p></div>
