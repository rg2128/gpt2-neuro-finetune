<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respiration</head><p><s>LFP oscillations related to nasal airflow.</s><s>To control if other effects not related to respiration were responsible for the loss of coherence between respiration and LFP in bulbectomized mice, we performed tracheotomies in intact, anaesthetized mice (n ¼ 3) to eliminate respiration through the nose.</s><s>This manipulation selectively prevented activation of the olfactory bulb through nasal airflow while leaving the bulb intact.</s><s>LFP activity was recorded in the whisker barrel cortex and respiratory activity was monitored through chest movements.</s><s>In addition, we generated an artificial rhythmic airflow through the nose independent from the spontaneous tracheal respiration (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>This was performed at three different frequencies of airflow and a controlled volume that mimicked the mouse's resting tidal volume of B0.15 ml (see Method).</s><s>Frequencies for artificial nasal airflow were chosen to be lower (0.8 Hz), higher (3.2 Hz) or the same (1.6 Hz) as the average spontaneous respiratory rate of the anaesthetized mouse.</s><s>In tracheotomized mice, the correlation between respiration and barrel cortical LFP activity was weak (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>,d,f, right, green), but the LFP activity was strongly correlated with the rhythmic nasal airflow (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>,d,f, right, black) at all three frequencies tested.</s></p><p><s>The highest correlation between nasal airflow and LFP activity occurred at a 1.6-Hz rhythm of nasal airflow.</s><s>This could be due to resonance phenomena in cortical principal neurons, which have been shown to possess a preferred subthreshold frequency close to 1.6 Hz (ref.</s><s>21).</s></p><p><s>LFP activity follows electrical olfactory bulb stimulation.</s><s>The rhythmic airflow through the nose might exert small mechanical forces on the olfactory bulb that could cause neuronal responses due to small movements of the brain tissue against the recording electrodes.</s><s>We therefore performed another control experiment in which we eliminated nasal airflow by performing a tracheotomy, but now modulated neuronal activity in the olfactory bulb through electrical stimulation while recording barrel cortical LFP activity.</s><s>We used rhythmic electrical stimulation consisting of brief trains of current steps to activate the ipsilateral olfactory bulb at the same frequencies used for the artificial nasal airflow stimulation (0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 Hz) in the previous experiment.</s><s>These stimuli caused stimulus-locked rhythmic fluctuations of the barrel cortical LFPs (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), confirming that rhythmic olfactory bulb activity rhythmically modulates neuronal activity in the whisker barrel cortex.</s><s>Phase-amplitude coupling of gamma and respiratory rhythms.</s></p><p><s>Recent studies suggest that gamma band amplitude or power is modulated in phase with delta band oscillations, a finding referred to as phase-amplitude coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Our data also show this type of cross-frequency interaction.</s><s>We found that the power of gamma oscillations (75 Hz) in the whisker barrel cortex was modulated in phase with the respiratory cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Thus, not only slow oscillations but also higher-frequency activities in the whisker barrel cortex are linked to respiration.</s><s>Such cross-frequency coupling has been implicated in spatial and temporal coordination of neuronal activity associated with higher brain functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>By use of a bootstrap statistical approach, using phase-randomized surrogate data (see Methods) we show that removal of the olfactory bulb eliminated the respiration-related modulation of power around the frequency range of transition from gamma (30-80 Hz) to fast (80-200 Hz) oscillations.</s><s>The opposite occurred in frequency ranges below and above this band where phase-amplitude coupling was observed after olfactory bulbectomy (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Retrograde tracing.</s><s>The pathway through which respirationlocked neuronal activity reaches the whisker barrel cortex is currently unknown.</s><s>The large olfactory or piriform cortex in mice is known to show respiration-locked neuronal oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and is thus a plausible link in the pathway from the main olfactory bulb to the barrel cortex.</s><s>To determine whether the whisker barrel cortex receives direct projections from the piriform cortex or other olfaction-related areas, such as the entorhinal cortex, the amygdala or the orbitofrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , we injected a retrograde tracer (Fluorogold) into the barrel cortex (see Methods).</s><s>Labelling of forebrain neurons projecting to the whisker barrel cortex was consistent with previous studies (for example, ref. 26).</s><s>Projection neurons were found in ventral posteromedial thalamus (VPM) and to a lesser extent as well in ventral posterolateral thalamus (VPL).</s><s>Labelled neurons were also found in several cortical areas, including contralateral barrel cortex, as well as adjacent ipsilateral cortical areas, including secondary somatosensory (S2), entorhinal and insular cortex and rostral motor cortex.</s><s>In somatosensory cortical areas, projection neurons were predominantly found in layers 2,3 and 5, but not in layers 1 or 4. Sparse, large labelled neurons were found in basal forebrain nuclei-these are likely cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis known to project to multiple cortical areas.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We find that respiration-locked olfactory bulb activity caused by airflow through the nose is a major driving force behind delta band neuronal oscillations in the somatosensory cortex of awake mice.</s><s>Coherence of cortical neuronal oscillations with respiration was reduced by 91% after removal of the olfactory bulb (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Somatosensory cortical oscillations could be directly linked to olfactory bulb activity by experiments involving controlled airflow activation of the bulb in tracheotomized mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) or through electrical stimulation of the bulb (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Both manipulations result in the modulation of barrel cortical activity phase locked to the airflow or electrical stimulation.</s></p><p><s>Adrian <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> showed already in 1950 that respiration drives oscillatory spike and LFP activity in the mammalian olfactory bulb.</s><s>A recent study in rats confirmed that respiration-locked oscillations in the bulb depend on rhythmic airflow through the nose <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>These oscillations do not require the detection of odours because mammalian olfactory sensory neurons are also mechanical sensors, signalling pressure changes caused by nasal airflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>The influence of respiration-locked olfactory bulb activity on the whisker barrel cortex is not limited to delta band oscillations.</s><s>Phase-amplitude coupling analysis reveals that the power of gamma band oscillatory activity in the whisker barrel cortex is modulated in phase with respiration-locked delta band activity.</s></p><p><s>An interaction between respiration as a behaviour linked to olfaction and active whisker movements for tactile exploration has been suggested by Welker, based on early behavioural observations in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Recent studies confirmed that respiratory and whisker tactile behaviours are coordinated in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , suggesting a coordinated interaction of olfactory and tactile sensory acquisition.</s><s>The fact that the two sensory systems are not independent is further supported by studies showing that the loss of one results in increased sensitivity in the other sensory modality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Whisking and breathing movements in mice are dynamically correlated with correlations being particularly strong during slow whisking (o5 Hz) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Thus, during slow whisking, sensory input from the whiskers is likely to contribute to the breathing-LFP coherence in the whisker barrel cortex, in addition to olfactory bulb sensory input.</s><s>However, the contribution of whisker sensory feedback to breathing-LFP coherence can be no larger than B10% of the maximal coherence, since bulbectomy experiments show that olfactory bulb activity accounts for B90% of LFP-breathing coherence.</s></p><p><s>Since delta band oscillations in cortical activity are also found in mammals who breathe much slower than mice (for example, humans), parallel neuronal mechanisms likely involving thalamocortical circuits exist that generate delta oscillations independent of the respiratory rhythm.</s><s>Our findings suggest, however, that respiration might cause a rhythmic modulation of somatosensory cortical activity at the species-specific respiratory rates.</s><s>Removing the olfactory bulb reduces the breathing-LFP coherence at the respiratory frequency by 91%.</s><s>Thus, in mice olfactory bulb activity was responsible for most of the respiration-locked neuronal oscillations, but other respiration related to sensory inputs, e.g., from the trigeminal nasal airflow sensors, upper airway sensors and chest muscles, are likely to contribute as well.</s><s>Those could be responsible for the residual respiration-locked modulation observed in bulbectomized mice and would also be present in animals with poor or no sense of olfaction, like dolphins.</s></p><p><s>Our findings provide a potential neuronal mechanism for the interaction between olfactory and whisker tactile sensation in awake-behaving mice.</s><s>Behavioural studies have shown that the timing of respiratory and whisker movements are dynamically coordinated <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>The results by Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> suggest that active odour and tactile sensing through sniffing and high-frequency whisking can occur independently in mice , while a study by Deschenes and colleagues suggests continuous strong phase locking between the two rhythms in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Gamma oscillations in the barrel cortex of rats have been shown to increase immediately before exploratory whisking behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and after mechanical whisker stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Whether these changes in gamma activity were linked to respiration was not addressed in those studies.</s><s>Our results suggest that the modulation of barrel cortical gamma band power in phase with respiration could play a role in coordinating olfactory and tactile sensory processing.</s><s>Additional clues about the potential functional role of respiration-locked oscillations in whisker sensory processing might come from a comparative investigation of different species.</s><s>Rats, gerbils, hamsters and chinchillas, who also have barrel cortices and motile whiskers, also have resting respiratory rates within the delta frequency band (B1.2, 1.4, 0.7 and 0.7 Hz, respectively).</s><s>On the basis of our findings those species could be expected to show respiration-locked gamma power modulation in the barrel cortex, similar to mice.</s><s>In contrast, Guniea pigs possess a whisker barrel cortex but have immotile mystacial whiskers and thus lack active whisker-sensing behaviour.</s><s>If respiration-locked modulations of gamma power does play a role in the coordination of respiration with whisker tactile sensing, it could be less pronounced or even absent in animals without active tactile sensing.</s></p><p><s>In summary, respiration-locked neuronal oscillation in the olfactory bulb is a major driving force behind delta band neuronal oscillations in the somatosensory cortex of mice.</s><s>Furthermore, gamma band oscillations, which have been widely implicated in higher cortical processing, are amplitude modulated in phase with respiration.</s><s>Thus, the life supporting respiratory behaviour, believed to be controlled mostly by brain stem centres, has an unexpected, indirect influence on higher-order brain activity in mice, via the olfactory system.</s><s>Whether similar influences of breathing on brain activity also exist in other cortical areas and possibly also in humans, whose olfactory bulb is much reduced in size relative to the neocortex, remain to be shown.</s></p></div>

temperature is represented as positive deflections of the thermistor voltage signal, which thus correspond to exhale movements (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>The raw thermistor voltage signal was digitized at 1 kHz and stored together with the electrophysiological signals.</s></p><p><s>On completion of each recording session, the Ringer's solution was removed, the recording chamber filled with triple antibiotic and the mice were returned to their home cages.</s><s>Each animal typically participated in experiments for 1-2 weeks.</s></p><p><s>Tracheotomy and nasal airflow control.</s><s>To further investigate the question whether neuronal activity was locked to respiration as a motor act or to nasal airflow and hence olfactory bulb activation, we opened the trachea in anaesthetized mice to separate respiration from nasal airflow.</s><s>While the mouse could breathe spontaneously through the descending trachea, we were able to independently modulate nasal airflow by moving air through the ascending trachea.</s></p><p><s>For the performance of a tracheotomy before electrophysiological recordings, mice (n ¼ 3) were anaesthetized with Avertin (400 mg kg À 1 ).</s><s>After completion of the tracheotomy, anaesthesia was continued with 1-2% Isoflurane in oxygen inhaled through the opening of the descending trachea.</s><s>Spontaneous respiration was monitored using a piezo film touching the chest wall.</s><s>The ascending trachea was connected to a Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA) to modulate nasal airflow by passing air (mimicking a B0.15 ml tidal volume) into the trachea.</s><s>Nasal airflow was modulated rhythmically to be half, the same and double the spontaneous respiration frequency (1.6 Hz).</s><s>Nasal airflow was modulated at 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 Hz and was monitored using a thermistor placed in front of the nostril as described in detail below.</s></p><p><s>Electrical stimulation of olfactory bulb.</s><s>To investigate whether local field potential activity in the whisker barrel cortex could be modulated by electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb in the absence of nasal airflow, we performed experiments in anaesthetized, tracheomotized mice (n ¼ 3).</s><s>A tracheotomy was performed under Avertin anaesthesia to eliminate nasal airflow and thus respiration-related bulbar activity.</s><s>Anaesthesia was then continued using Isoflurane inhaled through the pulmonary trachea.</s><s>Mice were mounted in a stereotaxic frame, and the skull was opened above the right whisker barrel cortex and olfactory bulb.</s><s>Recording electrodes were inserted into the whisker barrel cortex.</s><s>A concentric bipolar stimulation electrode was lowered onto the intact dura of the olfactory bulb.</s><s>We electrically stimulated the bulb with rhythmic stimulation patterns consisting of 50 Hz trains of stimuli with inter-train intervals of 1.25, 0.62 and 0.28 s, corresponding to stimulation rhythms of 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 Hz, respectively.</s><s>Stimulus trains consisted of 10-ms current steps using 50 or 80 mA stimulus currents.</s><s>We kept the train frequency and step duration constant while changing the number of pulses to generate different stimulation frequencies.</s><s>The stimulus trains had 30, 15 and 8 current steps for 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 Hz stimulation rhythms, respectively.</s></p><p><s>Creation of hypoxic conditions.</s><s>We increased the frequency of respiratory activity by exposing the mice for 1 min to hypoxic (B10% oxygen) air while continuously recording the local field potentials.</s><s>To this end, a custom-designed plastic cover was placed over the mouse leaving access to the recording chamber and head post through an opening at the top.</s><s>Respiratory behaviour was monitored with a thermistor as described above.</s><s>The composition of the air in the chamber was controlled by mixing atmospheric air with nitrogen at a ratio of 1/0 for normoxic and 1/2 for hypoxic conditions.</s><s>Gas flowed into the chamber at a rate of 1 l min À 1 .</s><s>An O 2 analyser (GB-300, Teledyne Anal.</s><s>Instr., City of Industry, CA, USA) continuously monitored the O 2 concentration in the chamber.</s><s>Following at least 5 min of stable LFP recording, mice were exposed to hypoxic air (10% O 2 ) for 1 min, followed by normoxic air.</s><s>Respiratory frequency, blood O 2 saturation and heart rate were measured using a MouseOx (Starr Life Sci.Corp.</s><s>Pittsburgh, USA) and recorded together with electrophysiological data before, during and after exposure to hypoxic air.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of local field potentials.</s><s>LFP data were collected in awake, head-fixed conditions from five intact and six olfactory bulbectomized mice.</s><s>Primary analysis involved identification of the correlation of the LFP activity to the respiratory activity and the frequency of the resting respiratory rhythm.</s><s>Periods of stable resting respiratory rhythm (o5 Hz) were selected for further analysis.</s><s>Coherence analysis focused on the resting respiratory frequency range (1-3 Hz) only, excluding higher respiratory rates associated with the brief episodes of sniffing.</s></p><p><s>Cross-correlations were calculated for each pair of simultaneously recorded respiratory and LFP signals, as well as the autocorrelation of each of the signals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The respiratory frequency was identified as the peak frequency of the power spectrum calculated from the respiratory signal after a bandpass filtering between 0.5 and 10 Hz (the 4th order Butterworth filter).</s></p><p><s>Phase locking between the respiratory rhythm or nasal airflow and the LFP oscillations was assessed by computing the coherence between the two signals.</s><s>The coherency spectrum was estimated in the following manner: 50-s segments of resting respiration and LFP signals served for the estimation of respiration-LFP coherence.</s><s>Each of these segments were further segmented in 19 subsegments of 5 s duration with 2.5 s overlap.</s><s>For each of those subsegments, we calculated the autospectrum separately of each signals and the cross-spectra of the respiration-LFP signals.</s><s>The auto-and cross-spectra were averaged over the 50-s segment, and the average cross-spectrum was normalized by the square roots of the average autospectra of the respiration and LFP signals.</s><s>To compare the degrees of the respiration-LFP coherence in normal and bulbectomized mice, we took from each coherency spectrum the coherence value at the corresponding respiration frequency and tested for the significance of the difference in the coherence values for the two groups with the Mann-Whitney U-test.</s><s>When we performed the coherence analysis in a time-resolved manner, we sampled consecutive 10-s segments of 9-s overlaps (that is, shifts in steps of 1 s) and applied the abovementioned coherence spectrum estimation to each of the 10-s segments with 1-s subsegments of 0.5-s overlaps.</s></p><p><s>To study cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling of the LFP activity, we extracted from the LFP recordings the oscillatory phase f fp ðtÞ and amplitude A fa ðtÞ at time t and at two different frequencies, respectively, that is, phase frequency f p and amplitude frequency f a .</s><s>For this extraction, we used the wavelet transform with a Morlet wavelet defined at time t and frequency f as ffiffi ffi f p Á exp½i2pf ðu À tÞ exp À ðu À tÞ 2 = 2s <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> ð Þ Â Ã .</s><s>The parameter s was set to 10/(6f) so that the wavelet contains about 10 cycles of oscillations.</s><s>The obtained amplitude was divided by its mean so that the absolute amplitude value, which depends on the frequency, does not affect the results of the forthcoming phase-amplitude coupling analysis.</s></p><p><s>The degree of the phase-amplitude coupling between the frequencies f a and f p</s></p><p><s>was measured with the mean vector length</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">MVL ¼ 1 T R T 0 X fa;fp ðtÞdt (Equation (1)),</formula><p><s>where T is the duration of the signal and X f a ,f p is the composite signal defined as X fa;fp ðtÞ A fa ðtÞ exp if fp ðtÞ h i (Equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)).</s><s>The phase frequency f p was fixed to the breathing frequency, estimated as the peak frequency of the power spectrum of the respiratory signal.</s><s>The amplitude frequency f a was varied in a range of frequencies between 1 and 256 Hz, sampled evenly on a logarithmic scale.</s><s>To test the significance of the mean vector length, 1,000 phase-randomized surrogates were generated from the original signal by applying random phase shift to every Fourier coefficient of the original signal in the frequency domain and then inverse-Fourier transforming the randomized signal back into the time domain.</s><s>The mean vector length was computed for each of them in exactly the same manner as for the original signal.</s><s>The original mean vector length was considered to be significantly high if it exceeded the 95 percentile of the surrogate mean vector lengths.</s><s>The mean vector length was computed for 50-s segments of the recordings sampled from artefact-free periods.</s><s>For each of the normal mice, 2-3 samples of such artefact-free segments were obtained.</s><s>For each of the bulbectomized mice, one segment of 50-s was taken.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of spiking activity.</s><s>In two awake, head-fixed mice, we recorded spiking activity in the whisker barrel cortices while also monitoring respiratory behaviour.</s><s>Spiking activity was recorded at a total of 12 sites, six in each mouse.</s><s>Spike events were extracted using a fixed threshold.</s><s>If the signal to noise ratio of a spike signal was larger than four and the inter-spike intervals had a gamma distribution with a refractory period 45 ms we regarded it as a single unit (n ¼ 3).</s><s>All other spike trains were regarded as multi-unit signals (n ¼ 9).</s><s>The spike trains were convolved with a Gaussian of unit area and s ¼ 2.5 ms, and the resulting function was correlated with the respiratory signal (that is, the thermistor voltage output).</s><s>To determine the significance of spike-respiration correlations, we generated surrogate correlations by randomly shifting the spike train in time relative to the respiratory times.</s><s>The spike train could be shifted in time by any random value between 0 s and the full duration of the recording.</s><s>All spike times were shifted by the same value, preserving the spike interval sequence.</s><s>The process was repeated 100 times, each time calculating the correlation of the shifted spike trains and saving the correlation values.</s><s>From these 100 surrogate correlations, we calculated the median and the 5th and 95th percentile of the distributions of correlation coefficients at each lag time.</s><s>Correlations were considered significant if the raw correlation coefficient values exceeded the 5th or 95th percentile of the surrogate distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Tracing studies.</s><s>Five mice were anaesthetized (i.p. injection) with Ketamine/ Xylazine (100/10 ml kg À 1 ) and positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA).</s><s>The scalp was opened with a midline incision, and the skull was levelled between bregma and lambda by adjusting the bite bar.</s><s>Body temperature was maintained at 35 °C using a heating pad.</s><s>A glass micropipette filled with 5% Fluorogold (FG; Fluorochrome, LLC, Denver, CO, USA) was lowered into barrel cortex (anteroposterior ¼ À 1.0 mm, mediolateral ¼ 3.8 mm, dorsoventral ¼ À 0.3 mm), and the tracer was injected via iontophoresis (Precision Current Source, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA), at 2 mA (cycle 8 s ON and 8 s OFF), for a total of 20 min.</s><s>The injection pipette was left in place for 10 min before and after the injection.</s><s>Supplemental anaesthetic was administered as necessary throughout the surgery to maintain the animals under deep anaesthesia.</s></p><p><s>After a 5-day survival period, mice were perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline and 4% paraformaldehyde.</s><s>The brains were removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 day and then transferred to a 30% buffered sucrose solution and stored at 4 °C for at least 1 week.</s><s>Coronal sections (40 mm, every other section) were cut serially using a freezing microtome.</s><s>FG can be visualized using fluorescent microscopy, so no further histological processing was necessary.</s><s>Sections were rinsed, mounted, air-dried and coverslipped on salinecoated slides with DPX mounting media for histology.</s><s>All material were visualized and imaged using a Leica (DMRXA2, Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL, USA) episcopic-fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu , Shizuoka, Japan) and imaging software (SimplePCI,
