<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manuscript text</head><p><s>With over 200,000 diagnoses per year, 1 in 6 U.S. men are diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime.</s><s>Yet, only 20% of prostate cancer patients have a high-risk cancer that represents possibly lethal disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>While mutational events in key genes characterizes a subset of lethal prostate cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , the molecular basis for aggressive disease remains poorly understood.</s></p><p><s>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA species &gt;200bp in length that are frequently polyadenylated and associated with transcription by RNA polymerase II <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>lncRNA-mediated biology has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes and in cancer, lncRNAs are emerging as a prominent layer of transcriptional regulation, often by collaborating with epigenetic complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Here, we hypothesized that prostate cancer aggressiveness was governed by uncharacterized lncRNAs and sought to discover lncRNAs associated with aggressive disease.</s><s>We previously used RNA-Seq to describe 121 novel lncRNA loci (out of &gt;1,800) that were aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Because only a fraction of prostate cancers present with aggressive clinical features <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , we performed cancer outlier profile analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> (COPA) to nominate intergenic lncRNAs selectively upregulated in a subset of cancers (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>We observed that only two, PCAT-109 and PCAT-114, which are both located in a "gene desert" on Chromosome 2q31.3 (Supplementary Fig. <ref

target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Of the two, PCAT-114 was expressed at higher levels in prostate cell lines, and in the PCAT-114 region we defined a 1.4 kb, polyadenylated gene composed of up to seven exons and spanning nearly 200kb on Ch2q31.3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>We named this gene Second Chromosome Locus Associated with Prostate-1 (SChLAP1) after its genomic location.</s><s>Published prostate cancer ChIP-Seq data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> confirmed that the transcriptional start site (TSS) of SChLAP1 was marked by H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and its gene body harbored H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>), an epigenetic signature consistent with lncRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>We observed numerous SChLAP1 splicing isoforms of which three (termed isoforms #1, #2, and #3, respectively) constituted the vast majority (&gt;90%) of transcripts in the cell (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we validated that SChLAP1 was highly expressed in ∼25% of prostate cancers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s><s>SChLAP1 prevalence was more frequent in metastatic compared to localized prostate cancers and was associated with ETS gene fusions in this cohort but not other molecular events (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>A computational analysis of the SChLAP1 sequence suggested no coding potential, which was confirmed experimentally by in vitro translation assays of three SChLAP1 isoforms (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, we found that SChLAP1 transcripts were located in the nucleus (Fig. <ref
