<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T</head><p><s>he olfactory system allows animals to interact with their environment and respond to signals of predation, mating and feeding.</s><s>The type of olfactory information animals require drastically differs depending on their behavioural state, for example, during hunting, mate-seeking or sleeping.</s><s>While a number of recent studies have examined the behavioural state regulation of olfactory processing at higher-level information processing centres in the brain, little is known as to how olfactory processing is regulated by physiological state at the level of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), partly owing to the complexity and diversity of odorant receptor (OR)-ligand coding.</s></p><p><s>Odour detection is initiated by the activation of OR proteins located at the cilia of OSNs in the olfactory epithelium (OE).</s><s>ORs make up the largest family of the seven transmembrane, G-proteincoupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, encompassing B400 and 1,200 OR proteins in human and mouse, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> .</s><s>Odour recognition in mammals is integrative, depending on a constellation of receptor-ligand interactions that activate a repertoire of ORs expressed by defined subsets of OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>The activated ORs lead to increased intracellular cAMP levels via the sequential activation of olfactory G-protein (Golf) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and type III adenylyl cyclase (ACIII) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Elevated cAMP levels lead to the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and influx of cations including Ca 2 þ .</s><s>The cation influx, together with the efflux of Cl À by a Ca 2 þ -activated Cl À channel results in a depolarization in OSNs, which leads to further Ca 2 þ influx via voltage-gated Ca 2 þ channels and ultimately triggers action potentials that transmit odour information downstream to the olfactory bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand, b-arrestin-2 inhibits OR activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , presumably by competing with G-protein for GPCR binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> to mediate receptor deactivation and internalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>In addition, b-arrestins function as scaffolds and recruit signalling molecules that mediate specific pathways including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases on their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>It is not clear how b-arrestin recruitment is regulated in the OSNs.</s></p><p><s>The OE is a highly specialized tissue that receives extensive innervation from parasympathetic nerve endings that release acetylcholine <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> .</s><s>Cholinergic microvillous cells distributed throughout the OE may provide an alternative or additional source of acetylcholine <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Functional studies in amphibian OSNs showed that acetylcholine receptor agonists potentiated odour responses and increased the excitability of OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , and that antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors resulted in the opposite effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>We previously reported that the type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-R) physically interacts with ORs to promote odour-induced responses in vitro and showed that M3-selective antagonists attenuated odour-induced Ca 2 þ responses in dissociated OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand, acetylcholine has been shown to suppress Ca 2 þ increases in some OSNs induced by an adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Thus, it remains unclear whether and how acetylcholine potentiates OSN activity.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we examine the role of M3-R in regulating odour responses in OSNs using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches.</s><s>We show that OSNs from M3-R knockout (KO) mice exhibit decreased odour response amplitudes, are less likely to respond to odour stimulation and do not show a reduction in odour responses in the presence of darifenacin as compared with OSNs from wild-type (WT) mice.</s><s>Moreover, application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol or the physiological M3-R ligand acetylcholine resulted in increased odour-induced responses in OSNs.</s><s>To identify the mechanism, we used a novel b-arrestin-2 recruitment assay for ORs expressed in heterologous cells to show that M3-R inhibits b-arrestin-2 recruitment in ORs in an activity-dependent manner.</s><s>In addition, b-arrestin-2 deficiencies attenuate the potentiation of OR-mediated cAMP responses by M3-R.</s><s>Interestingly, these effects cannot be explained by competition for b-arrestin-2 between M3-R and ORs.</s><s>Finally, we show that the third intracellular loop (i3) of M3-R is important for inhibiting OR/ b-arrestin-2 interactions.</s><s>Together, our results demonstrate that M3-Rs modulate OR activity by regulating b-arrestin-2 recruitment, thus revealing a novel mechanism for acetylcholine in regulating olfactory sensory processing at the peripheral level.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>M3-Rs are expressed in the cilia layer of the OE.</s><s>We have previously shown that the M3-R protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> is expressed in the cilia of OSNs and that M3-R mRNA transcripts are detectable in OSN somata <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>However, it was recently reported that the M3-R protein was expressed by the supporting cells rather than primarily in OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>In order to validate and characterize the expression pattern of M3-Rs, we performed immunostaining of the OSN cilia with the M3-R antibody in WT (or M3-R þ / þ ) and M3-R KO (or M3-R À / À ) mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, a plant lectin that labels a subset of OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , was used to stain the cilia layer.</s></p><p><s>We detected robust M3-R staining in the OSN cilia of WT animals (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>; n ¼ 8 sections from four animals).</s><s>As expected, OSN cilia obtained from M3-R KO mice did not show detectable M3-R staining (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>; n ¼ 6 sections from two animals), supporting our previous find that M3-Rs are specifically expressed in OSNs.</s><s>In addition, we noted that the gross anatomy of the OE as well as the cilia morphology in whole-mount OE attached to the septal wall from M3-R KO mice is indistinguishable from that of WT littermates (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>; n ¼ 4 epithelial preparations from two animals for each condition).</s><s>These results suggest that genetic ablation of M3-Rs does not affect the anatomical development or organization of OSNs in the OE.</s></p><p><s>M3-Rs modulate odorant-induced responses of OSNs.</s><s>We previously showed that acutely dissociated OSNs from WT mice exhibit attenuated odour-mediated Ca 2 þ responses in the presence of M3-R-preferring antagonist darifenacin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>If the modulation of OSN activation by darifenacin is attributable to M3-R-related inhibition, then darifenacin is expected to have no effect in M3-R KO mice.</s><s>To test this, we compared odourinduced Ca 2 þ responses of dissociated OSNs derived from M3-R À / À mice and M3-R þ / þ littermates in response to a mixture of 10 odorants with or without 0.1 mM darifenacin (see Methods section).</s><s>While odour responses were significantly attenuated by darifenacin in M3-R þ / þ OSNs (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>,b, Po0.0001, two-tailed paired t-test, n ¼ 36 pairs), darifenacin had no significant effect on odour-induced responses in M3-R À / À OSNs (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, P ¼ 0.4183, two-tailed paired t-test, n ¼ 62 pairs).</s><s>These results demonstrate that darifenacin inhibits odour-mediated Ca 2 þ responses of OSNs in an M3-R-dependent manner.</s></p><p><s>While Ca 2 þ imaging of dissociated OSNs can simultaneously assess the stimulated response profiles of dozens of OSNs, it is an indirect measure of OSN activation, since Ca 2 þ influx occurs several steps downstream from OR activation, which is where M3-Rs are expected to interact with ORs.</s><s>Another concern is that enzymatic and mechanical OSN dissociation may alter the physiological activity of OSNs.</s><s>To more directly investigate how M3-Rs modulate OR activation, we performed perforated patchclamp recordings on the dendritic knobs of in situ OSNs from intact OE <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Under voltage-clamp mode, brief puffs of an odorant mixture (19 odorants at equal molar concentration of 100 mM; see Methods section for details) elicited inward currents in 72.5% (50 out of 69) of randomly chosen OSNs from WT animals (including WT C57BL/6 mice and M3-R þ / þ littermate controls, see below).</s><s>Out of the 50 odour-responsive cells (defined as when odour-induced currents 45 pA), we were able to measure the responses induced by the odorant mixture with or without 0.1 mM darifenacin in 41 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) by alternating between two barrels of the puffing pipette (odorants or odorants þ darifenacin; see Methods section).</s><s>In a single cell, we performed multiple (typically 3-4) rounds of stimulation and averaged the peak currents from all trials with identical stimuli.</s></p><p><s>We observed that coadministration of 0.1 mM darifenacin either abolished (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, cell 1) or reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, cell 2) odourinduced responses.</s><s>The peak currents were significantly reduced in the presence of darifenacin (odorants: 67.4±10.9</s><s>pA and odorants þ darifenacin: 52.2 ± 11.1 pA, n ¼ 41, Po0.0002 in twotailed, paired t-test).</s><s>To compare the effects of darifenacin across all cells, we plotted the peak current induced by odorants þ darifenacin versus that by odorants alone for each of the 41 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>).</s><s>We observed that most points fell below the identity line y ¼ x, indicating that the effects of darifenacin were largely independent of the cell-to-cell variations in odour responses.</s><s>In summary, our electrophysiological results demonstrate that a selective M3-R antagonist reduces odour responses of OSNs from WT animals, consistent with our in vitro and Ca 2 þ -imaging data <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Given that M3-R antagonism inhibits OR activation, we next asked whether activation of M3-Rs would potentiate odour responses in OSNs.</s><s>We tested the effects of cholinergic agonists on odour responses by patch-clamp recordings in an independent set of OSNs in WT animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>A total of 30 odourresponsive cells were tested with 1 mM carbachol (odorants þ Ringer's solution: 25.2 ± 3.2 pA and odorants þ carbachol at 1 mM: 42.5±5.3</s><s>pA, n ¼ 30, Po0.0002 in two-tailed, paired t-test).</s><s>Among these 30 cells, 17 cells were also tested with 0.1 mM carbachol (odorants þ Ringer's: 22.7±5.1 pA and odorants þ carbachol at 0.1 mM: 47.5 ± 9.8 pA, n ¼ 17, P ¼ 0.0012 in paired t-test), and 15 cells were also stimulated with 1 mM acetylcholine (odorants þ Ringer's: 24.8 ± 5.6 pA and odorants þ ACh: 48.6 ± 10.8 pA, n ¼ 15, P ¼ 0.0050 in paired t-test).</s><s>The raw data from one OSN tested with all three agonist solutions are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>.</s><s>For each cell, we plotted the peak current induced by odorants þ agonist against that induced by odorants þ Ringer's solution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>).</s><s>Most data points lie above the identity line, indicating that cholinergic agonists enhance odour responses in OSNs.</s></p><p><s>To exclude the possibility that darifenacin inhibits OSN responses due to toxicity or nonspecific effects, we compared patch-clamp analysis of OSNs in intact OE from WT (including littermate M3-R þ / þ ), heterozygous (HET or M3-R þ / À ) and KO (M3-R À / À ) mice.</s><s>As expected, the responses were not attenuated in the presence of 0.1 mM darifenacin from 14 odour-responsive OSNs in M3-R À / À mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) (odorants: 32.9 ± 11.3 pA and odorants þ darfenacin: 35.4 ± 11.6 pA, n ¼ 14, P ¼ 0.2761 in paired t-test).</s><s>In the 10 OSNs obtained from heterozygous M3-R þ / À mice, we did observe a trend of attenuation in odour responses by darifenacin (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>), but the effect was not significant (odorants: 43. and odorants þ darifenacin: 36.5 ± 16.9 pA, n ¼ 10, P ¼ 0.2276 in paired t-test).</s><s>These findings confirm that the effects of M3-R antagonism on odour responses are abolished in M3-R À / À mice.</s><s>Given that M3-R antagonism attenuated odour responses of OSNs in WT animals and that basal expression of M3-Rs without M3-R agonists was sufficient to potentiate OR responses in vitro, we asked whether the loss of M3-R expression would reduce the sensitivity and/or the response amplitude of odour-induced OSN responses.</s><s>Indeed, the average peak current of odour responses in OSNs from M3-R À / À mice was B33 pA compared with B68 pA in WT OSNs recorded under similar conditions (P ¼ 0.0352, two-tailed t-test).</s><s>More strikingly, the likelihood of an OSN to respond to the odorant mixture stimulation was significantly lower (P ¼ 0.019, Fisher's exact test) in M3-R À / À mice (18 out of 45 or 40.0% of tested cells) compared with their M3-R þ / þ littermates (27 out of 41 or 65.8%), suggesting that the expression of M3-Rs affects the odour response threshold of OSNs.</s><s>Together, these results constitute the first demonstration that lack of M3-R expression results in functional deficits in mammalian OSNs.</s></p><p><s>The M3-R-activated PLC pathway is not required for OR potentiation.</s><s>Thus far, we have shown that the role of M3-Rs in OR activation is physiologically relevant and consistent with our in vitro observations.</s><s>However, we have little understanding of the molecular basis by which M3-Rs potentiate OR activation.</s><s>A number of models could potentially account for the activation and they can be largely divided into the following two categories:</s></p><p><s>(1) the physical interaction of the two receptors promotes odourinduced OR activation; (2) the potentiation is the result of downstream cross talk between OR-and M3-R-mediated PLC-IP3 (Phospholipase C-Inositol triphosphate) signalling, independent of physical interaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>).</s><s>To test the possibility that M3-R-mediated OR potentiation results from downstream signalling pathways, we exposed HEK293T cells expressing OR-S6, M3-Rs and RTP1S to nonanedioic acid, a potent OR-S6 ligand, in the presence or absence of the PLC inhibitor U73122 (5 mM).</s><s>We observed no significant differences in the OR-mediated cAMP response with or without application of the PLC inhibitor (P ¼ 0.20; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>), while application of the PLC inhibitor almost completely abolished endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 þ release downstream of the PLC-IP3 pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5c</ref>).</s><s>These results A quantitative b-arrestin-2 recruitment assay for ORs.</s><s>Another mechanism by which M3-Rs could potentiate OR-mediated G-protein signalling may be via inhibition of alternative signalling, thus leading to increased cAMP release following odour stimulation.</s><s>Specifically, we hypothesized that M3-Rs inhibit the recruitment of b-arrestin-2 to activated ORs.</s><s>To test this model, we developed a quantitative and efficient assay to measure ORmediated b-arrestin-2 recruitment by combining our in vitro OR expression assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> with a split-luciferase system <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>; see Methods section for details).</s></p><p><s>In this system, we expressed ORs and b-arrestin-2 tagged with luciferase fragments (OR-S6-NLuc, B84 kDa and Arrb2-CLuc, B63 kDa; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) in HEK293T cells along with RTP1S, an accessory protein required for the efficient trafficking of many ORs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , observing that as expected, the cells exhibited increased bioluminescence following nonanedioic acid stimulation in a dose-dependent manner.</s><s>In contrast, when either OR-NLuc or Arrb2-CLuc was substituted with control proteins tagged with corresponding luciferase fragments (FRP-NLuc and CLuc-FKBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , two proteins known to form a complex in the presence of rapamycin but have no known involvement in olfactory signalling pathways), the dose-dependent response was abolished, indicating that the observed b-arrestin-2 recruitment upon odour stimulation was OR specific (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>).</s><s>We also observed dose-dependent b-arrestin-2 recruitment for three additional ORs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), and demonstrated that the observed b-arrestin-2 recruitment occurred in a RTP1S-dependent manner for receptors that require RTP1S coexpression for cell-surface trafficking (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>The tagged ORs showed normal cAMP responses to their cognate ligands and the responses were potentiated by M3-R coexpression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>To further demonstrate the specificity of this assay, we measured b-arrestin-2 recruitment to an OR, OR-EG, following stimulation with various chemicals with similar structure to its well-defined ligand, eugenol <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>The measured b-arrestin-2 recruitment agreed with the cAMP responses for each chemical tested, in that the chemicals that induced cAMP response also led to b-arrestin-2 recruitment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we found that one chemical, veratraldehyde, elicited stronger cAMP responses than b-arrestin-2 recruitment (Fig. <ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here, we extensively characterized the mechanisms by which M3-Rs can modulate OR activation in native OSNs and heterologous cells

which M3-Rs exert action on OR activation.</s><s>We confirmed that M3-Rs are expressed in the cilia layer of the OE and showed that the genetic ablation of M3-Rs does not affect the anatomical organization of the OE nor the development of olfactory cilia (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>We then demonstrated that darifenacin, a selective antagonist for M3-R, significantly attenuates odour-induced Ca 2 þ and electrical signals in OSNs from WT, but not from M3-R KO mice (Figs <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, carbachol and acetylcholine enhanced odour-induced transduction currents in OSNs from WT animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>These data strongly support a role for acetylcholine in modulating the sense of smell at the periphery.</s><s>Furthermore, we presence of M3-R ligands, suggests a potential pathway through which olfactory perception can be modulated by cholinergic signalling at the periphery.</s><s>M3-R was first identified as a non-OR GPCR that modulates OR activity through a screen for candidate proteins that potentiate OR activation in HEK293T cells.</s><s>The M3-R transcript and protein have previously been shown to colocalize with olfactory marker protein-expressing OSNs in the OE.</s><s>Ogura et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> recently reported that M3-R protein is expressed in the supporting cells, and that acetylcholine suppresses forskolininduced Ca 2 þ increase in OSNs.</s><s>To address these discrepancies, we used M3-R À / À mice to determine expression patterns of M3-R as well as its modulatory effects on OR function.</s><s>Our immunostaining results are consistent with the original report showing that M3-R protein is predominantly expressed in the cilia of the OE (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), although there is also some weak staining of the supporting cells in some regions.</s><s>In control experiments without the primary M3-R antibody, we did not observe M3-R staining in the cilia layer, but we did observe similar staining in the supporting cells, suggesting that the staining in the supporting cells may be nonspecific for M3-R.</s><s>Our data support a model in which M3-Rs potentiate OR activity upstream of type III adenylyl cyclase.</s><s>This potentiation could overwhelm downstream suppressive effects by acetylcholine.</s><s>This model could in turn reconcile potentiation of odour-induced OSN activity and the suppression of forskolin-induced activity in some OSNs.</s></p><p><s>Given that M3-Rs are expressed in OSNs, it is plausible that the interaction of M3-Rs and ORs found in HEK293T cells is not purely a result of overexpression, but may be relevant for physiological functions of ORs and, consequently, OSNs.</s><s>Consistent with the observations made in HEK293T cells transfected with ORs and M3-Rs <ref

effect of M3-R expression on OR responses.</s><s>For some Ors, the effect of M3-R expression is far greater than others.</s><s>Likewise, during Ca 2 þ imaging and patch-clamp analysis, it was clear that there was also variance among OSNs in their responses to darifenacin.</s><s>We also found that costimulating OSNs with odorants and a muscarinic agonist, carbachol, or the physiological muscarinic ligand acetylcholine, enhanced the odour responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>Curiously, a small subset of OSNs from WT animals showed the opposite modulation by M3-R antagonists and agonists (Figs <ref type="figure">3c</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>).</s><s>One possibility is that darifenacin has off-target effects and that in the

recruitment to ORs remains to be further elucidated.</s><s>One possibility is that M3-R-OR heteromerization allosterically inhibits the ability of ORs to bind b-arrestin-2.</s><s>For example, the
