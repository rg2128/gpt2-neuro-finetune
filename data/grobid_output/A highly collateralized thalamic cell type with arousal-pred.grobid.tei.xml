<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The mechanisms of state transitions during sleep or between sleep and wakefulness are complex and poorly understood1,2.</s><s>Sleep itself is a highly dynamic state which consists of rapid transitions between slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleeps and fluctuating levels of arousal that manifest e.g. as cyclic alternating patterns or microarousals3-5.</s><s>Control of these brain state changes appears to involve an ever-increasing number of interacting brain centers located mainly in the brainstem and the hypothalamus2,6.</s><s>It is still unclear, however, how the final output of these centers is summated and transferred rapidly to the forebrain as a coordinated, graded signal, i.e. how arousal is controlled in a fast and synchronous manner in the forebrain.</s></p><p><s>Earlier studies using traditional tracing techniques suggested that cells in the dorsal medial thalamus (DMT) receive inputs from the main hypothalamic and brainstem arousal centers and innervate several cortical and subcortical regions in the forebrain7-10.</s><s>DMT utilizes fast glutamatergic transmission7-9, thus, is in a position to mediate rapid responses in forebrain structures.</s><s>Indeed, lesions involving DMT in humans have been linked to hypersomnia and altered vigilance states11,12.</s><s>However, thalamic neurons that are functionally related are often not confined to a single nucleus, and thalamocortical cells with distinct properties can intermingle13.</s><s>Moreover, the DMT region includes various nuclei with irregular shape and size, which complicates traditional approaches for anatomical or functional interrogation.</s><s>As a result, it is still unclear which thalamic neuron population, if any14,15, mediates forebrain arousal and what neuronal activity governs concerted state changes among forebrain areas.</s></p><p><s>In both rodents and humans, DMT contains large population of calretinin-positive (CR+) cells scattered across the various nuclei of this region16, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we tested whether this DMT/CR+ neuronal population plays a specific role in forebrain arousal.</s><s>Using celltype specific approaches, we investigated DMT/CR+ neurons' arousal-related activity, connectivity and impact on arousal.</s><s>We also investigated their inputs in the equivalent human DMT region and compared the properties of arousals elicited by DMT/CR+ cells and sensory thalamic nuclei.</s><s>Predictive coding before sleep-wake transition, graded arousal responses and widespread, synchronous impact on forebrain targets identified DMT/CR+ cells as a key mediator of forebrain arousal.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arousal-related activity of DMT/CR+ neurons</head><p><s>Neurons in the DMT are known to display diurnal18 and stress related19-23 cFos protein expression.</s><s>In addition, this thalamic region is known to contain high number of calretinincontaining (CR+) neurons16.</s><s>Thus, to identify whether CR is a reliable marker for the activity-dependent DMT cell population, we perfused mice during the light (Zeitgeber time, ZT2.5, sleep) or the dark (ZT14.5, wake) phase of their diurnal cycles and tested the CR content and cFos expression of DMT cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a-e</ref>).</s><s>The DMT of mice contained significantly higher number of cFos+ neurons during the dark than in the light phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b-d</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) similar to rats18.</s><s>The vast majority (~91%) of these neurons co-expressed CR in both states (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The cFos/CR+ neurons were present in the major nucleus of the DMT (the paraventricular nucleus, PVN) but were also dispersed in adjacent portions of the anterior intralaminar and mediodorsal nuclei.</s><s>Since this neuronal population was not confined to a single nucleus, we will refer to it as dorsal medial thalamic calretinin-positive (DMT/CR+) cells throughout this study.</s></p><p><s>Next, the DMT/CR+ cells were optogenetically tagged using short pulses of blue light (473 nm) in CR (Calb2)-Cre mice injected with AAV-DIO-ChR2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>, g and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a-d</ref>) and their firing were extracellularly monitored during sleep/wake state changes for several hours.</s><s>Thirty-one out of 65 well-isolated units displayed elevated firing rate to the tagging protocol and were thus considered as CR+ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1h</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>The activity of 29 out of these 31 DMT/CR+ cells (93.5%) was correlated with changes in the EMG activity accompanying arousal from sleep.</s><s>Twenty out of the 31 DMT/CR+ cells (64.5%) started to increase their firing rate significantly up to 5-10 sec prior to the onset of EMG activity and maintained elevated activity for tens of seconds after the EMG activation (labeled as '+/+' cells; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1h</ref>; Supplementary Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>In studies of brainstem neurons, a similar anticipatory elevation of firing rate several seconds prior to EMG activation has been considered as the best indicator for their involvement in arousal24.</s><s>The other eight DMT/CR + neurons (25.8%) increased their firing at the onset of EMG activity, but not before, and remained active during it (labeled as '0/+' cells; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e-f</ref>).</s><s>Of the remaining 3 DMT/CR+ cells, one decreased its firing during EMG activation and two showed no changes (labeled as '-/-' and '0/0', respectively; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Thirty four of the original 65 DMT neurons did not react to the tagging protocol and thus were regarded as putative CR-cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1j</ref>).</s><s>Among these, only 8/34 (23.5%) cells increased their firing prior to EMG activity, while the rest did not (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1i</ref>).</s><s>As a consequence, at the population level, DMT/CR-neurons did not show anticipatory activity in sharp contrast to the DMT/CR+ population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1i</ref>).</s><s>Increased firing of DMT/CR-cells at the onset of the EMG signal was also shorter and lasted only for 1-2 sec, not for over 10 sec as in the case of DMT/CR+ cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>These data show that DMT/CR+ cells selectively display arousal related, predictive firing activity.</s></p><p><s>To analyze if under arousing conditions during the awake state, such as stress, DMT neurons are also CR+, we subjected three groups of animals to increasingly stressful situations (handling control, habituation to a novel environment (a foot-shock chamber)[Au:OK?] and foot shock) before perfusion.</s><s>The number of cFos+ neurons significantly increased in the DMT in situations eliciting increasingly elevated arousal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a-c</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>When tested for CR expression, the vast majority of foot-shock-activated cFos+ cells expressed CR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref>, e and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To assess the response to a painful arousing signal, we measured the firing response of individual, juxtacellularly recorded and labeled DMT/CR+ cells to tail pinch under anesthesia (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Tail pinch caused a reduction in the delta power of frontal cortical LFP in all cases.</s><s>Six out of 13 DMT/CR+ cells significantly increased their activity during tail pinch, and activity remained elevated even after its termination (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>The remaining cells decreased their firing, which may indicate the existence of an inhibitory signal to DMT25 that is active during these conditions.</s><s>Lastly, to directly examine the role of DMT/CR+ cells during an arousing situation (exploration of a novel environment), we optogenetically silenced them with an inhibitory step-function opsin, SwichR 26 by injecting CR-Cre transgenic mice with AAV-DIO-SwichR-eYFP or AAV-DIO-eYFP (control) and analyzed their locomotor behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2f</ref>).</s><s>Short pulses (0.5-2 sec) of blue light evoked long lasting inactivation of SwichR-expressing CR+ cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>We found that during the inhibition of DMT/CR+ cells, the number of pauses (lack of movements for time period less than 2 sec) increased by 50% in an open field chamber (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2g-i</ref>) indicating disruption of exploratory activity.</s><s>Control animals showed no behavioral changes.</s><s>These data together demonstrate tight links between the activity of DMT/CR+ cells and arousal both at the cellular and behavioral levels.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graded arousal elicited by DMT/CR+ cells</head><p><s>To directly test whether selective activation of DMT/CR+ neurons can initiate state transitions in freely sleeping animals, first, we checked the reliability of their optogenetic responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>).</s><s>CR-Cre mice were injected with AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a-d</ref>) and subjected to juxtacellular recording and labeling under urethane anesthesia.</s><s>When tested with 1 ms laser light, all DMT neurons post-hoc identified as ChR2-eYFP-positve (n = 4 cells) were able to follow 20 Hz stimulation for up to 10 sec with short response latency (1.8 ± 1.1 ms), low jitter and very high probability (0.997 ± 0.005; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b-e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Then, we injected either AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP or AAV-DIO-eYFP into the DMT of CR-Cre mice and subsequently photostimulated it with 10 sec long, 10 Hz light pulse trains (see Methods) via a chronically implanted optic fibers, in drug-free conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>We used 10 Hz stimulation, since in our freely-moving experiments all recorded DMT/CR+ cells (n = 31) were able to fire at this frequency and 66% of them were able to sustain this activity for at least 1 sec during awakening.</s></p><p><s>Ten-second activation of DMT/CR+ neurons faithfully induced prolonged behavioral arousal accompanied by active locomotion in all ChR2-injected mice during NREM sleep (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3h</ref>, Supplementary Video 1).</s><s>Parameters of arousal were measured based on the EMG signal (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>).</s><s>Evoked arousal outlasted the stimulation by several minutes (range: 2.17 and 17.89 min; average: 8.9±5.6 min).</s><s>The photostimulation of DMT/CR+ cells first induced an immediate drop in delta power (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>) followed by an abrupt increase in EMG activity with a latency of 1.34 ± 0.64 sec (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3h</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>).</s><s>During the first 180 sec following the stimulation, the animals spent 78.66% (141.59 ± 21.43 sec) of their time in active, awake state (EMG ON).</s><s>The same value for the pre-stimulation period was 3.65%, (6.58 ± 3.54 sec).</s><s>In the control eYFP injected animals, no arousal was evoked (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3i</ref>;
