<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic labeling of inhibitory granule cells at differing maturation states</head><p><s>With the goal of mapping sensory activation in developmental subsets of inhibitory interneurons within the olfactory bulb, we implemented conditional viral genetic methods to selectively label granule cells at different stages of maturation.</s><s>We used transgenic mice that expressed Cre recombinase under the control of a promoter from either the inhibitory progenitor marker Dlx5/6 (ref.</s><s>32), to target immature adult-born granule cells, or corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (Crhr1), which marks mature, integrated granule cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Using conditional viral reporters, we verified that both Cre lines labeled granule cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), but whereas GFP-labeled cells were concentrated in the middle or deep layers of Dlx5/6-Cre bulbs, Crhr1-targeted cells were predominantly located near the superficial and middle granule cell layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with granule cell migration patterns whereby early progenitors migrate from the core of the olfactory bulb to the superficial layer, which is enriched in mature and integrated granule cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition to the temporal specification provided by conditional viral labeling, we also spatially limited the injection to the center of the olfactory bulb, thereby avoiding neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream and other layers of the olfactory bulb where inhibitory neurons reside.</s><s>Thus, the vast majority of the cells labeled through conditional viral injections were granule cells, and we rarely observed labeled cells outside the granule cell layer in either Dlx5/6-Cre or Crhr1-Cre targeted mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To differentiate the temporal dynamics of the Dlx5/6 and Crhr1 drivers in the olfactory bulb, we performed 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) birth dating in combination with viral labeling.</s><s>Dlx5/6-Cre mice were first pulsed with the proliferation marker EdU, followed by injections of conditional GFP virus into the olfactory bulb at time points ranging between 7 and 60 d after EdU delivery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d top)</ref>.</s><s>At the earliest time points examined, 7 and 14 d after EdU labeling, we observed the highest ratio of GFP + EdU + /total EdU + cells, whereas the amount of coexpression dropped below half of the highest ratio after 21 d, eventually plateauing by 40 d (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>By targeting viral delivery to the olfactory bulb and avoiding brain structures that harbor earlier-stage granule cell progenitors, we never observed colabeling ratios above 60% at the earliest time points, when many migrating neurons have not reached the olfactory bulb.</s><s>Notably, and integral to our study design, this developmental expression pattern was the inverse of what we previously obtained for the temporal expression in Crhr1-expressing neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> bottom and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>), where we noted colabeling in more than 50% of new granule cells 21 d after EdU labeling and where the ratio plateaued to near 100% by 28 d.</s><s>Thus, using the Dlx5/6-Cre and Crhr1-Cre driver lines, combined with stereotaxic viral injections of conditional reporters into the core of the olfactory bulb, we isolated granule cells at distinct stages of interneuron development.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional maturation states of genetically labeled granule cells</head><p><s>We next sought to determine the functional maturation state of selectively labeled inhibitory granule cells via whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology.</s><s>Through visually targeted whole-cell recordings, we found that both Dlx5/6-and Crhr1-expressing neurons were active, and injected current elicited action potentials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>However, although Dlx5/6expressing neurons were electrically functional, they displayed several indicators of a more immature state, including wider action potential half-width (2.691 ± 0.23 ms versus 2.02 ± 0.19 ms), higher membrane resistance (970 ± 79 MΩ versus 645 ± 57 MΩ) and lower capacitance (11.43 ± 0.82 pF versus 13.71 ± 1.28 pF) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b-d</ref>).</s><s>However, we did not observe any differences between the two classes of granule cells in the frequency-current curves, resting potentials, amount of current needed to reach action potential threshold (14.91 ± 1.78 pA versus 18.56 ± 2.87 pA) or time to action potential peak in response to a current injection (49.05 ± 7.00 ms versus 62.74.70 ± 11.36 ms at 30pA) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e-h</ref>).</s><s>In fact, anatomically we did not observe gross morphological differences between these developmentally staggered groups of granule cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To distinguish whether Dlx5/6-expressing cells are early stage neurons that later give rise to Crhr1-expressing neurons, versus a distinct neuronal subpopulation, we crossed Dlx5/6-Cre mice to Crhr1-GFP reporter mice and virally labeled Dlx5/6-expressing cells to track the conversion of Dlx5/6 neurons into Crhr1 neurons over time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2i</ref>).</s><s>We observed only a small overlap in the labeled cells 14 d after viral injection of AAV-flex-tdTomato to label Dlx5/6 neurons, whereas the percentage of original Dlx5/6-expressing cells that became Crhr1 + increased to over 80% by 60 d after injection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>Together, these data suggest that the two drivers label functionally distinct stages of granule cell development, but both types of cells respond and fire action potentials similarly to presynaptic excitatory input, and both populations could actively participate in olfactory bulb circuitry.</s></p></div>

of inhibitory interneuron populations as they become integrated into existing excitatory circuitry and further analyze how functional integration translates into sensory activation of a network.</s><s>Notably, we found that, in contrast to previously described maps that show consolidation and refinement of excitatory connections with maturation, interneurons display a dramatic expansion and broadening of their patterned connectivity.</s><s>Although excitatory and inhibitory cells have opposing functions in the brain, and as such it is reasonable that their network development would likewise be different, it is still surprising that inhibitory sensory map development was opposite.</s></p><p><s>Historically, granule cell function has been closely tied to lateral inhibition and contrast enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Although the dendrites of individual granule cells extend only 200 μm within the external plexiform layer, the

suggest that granule cells are first innervated by common or local inputs before being recruited by distant, functionally distinct areas.</s></p><p><s>Intriguingly, map expansion evident in olfactory bulb granule cells may be a fundamental principle of inhibitory map development.</s><s>If most inhibitory cells are broadly tuned or can respond to a wide range of stimuli, it would follow that an individual stimulus could activate a diverse and expansive number of inhibitory cells, thereby creating a broad map.</s><s>Such a broad map could either be present from the earliest stages of development or, as we found, the map could evolve and broaden through experience and time.</s><s>These types of associative connections that result from adding distal inputs after the establishment of initial local connections are ideal cellular candidates for brain state-dependent neuromodulation, learning, or memory.</s></p><p><s>Current theories on the importance of granule cells have suggested roles in plasticity and memory.</s><s>Likewise, the importance of inhibitory neurons in brain plasticity is well supported.</s><s>Previously, the search for neural correlates of learning and plasticity had focused largely on excitatory cells and synapses, but it is now appreciated that inhibitory interneurons also play an integral role in the brain's ability to adapt and learn.</s><s>Inhibitory neurons directly influence phases of enhanced plasticity during critical periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , and inhibitory circuits contribute to both

inhibitory sensory maps may provide contextual information for early sensory processing, which is later modulated by activitydependent synaptogenesis.</s><s>One intriguing possible biological consequence of this is that developmental expansion of inhibitory sensory maps may represent circuit substrates for associative learning.</s></p><p><s>We have also defined the later stages of granule
