by optogenetically activating these taste cortical fields in awake mice, it is possible to evoke prototypical taste behaviors in the total absence of taste stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The two most important sensory features of a taste stimulus are its identity and its valence.</s><s>We anticipated that by examining the neural targets of the sweet and bitter cortical fields it may be possible to uncover the circuit logic for appetitive versus aversive tastes.</s><s>To trace the projections of neurons in sweet and bitter cortex, we labeled neurons in the sweet cortical field with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), those in the bitter cortex with red fluorescent protein (tdTomato), and then whole brains were examined by clearing and rapid 3D imaging with light-sheet microscopy using CUBIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Our results showed that projections from the sweet and bitter cortical fields target multiple brain areas, including contralateral taste cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, caudoputamen, and thalamus (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</s><s>Most noticeably, sweet and bitter cortical projections exhibited strong segregation as "separate lines" while navigating to the amygdala (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), with neurons from the sweet cortical field terminating in the anterior basolateral amygdala (BLAa), while neurons in the bitter cortical field projected predominantly to central amygdala (CEA), with some terminals in posterior BLA.</s><s>We extended these findings by performing anterograde labeling experiments using Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-based trans-synaptic transfer of Cre-recombinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> from sweet and bitter cortex to targets in the amygdala.</s><s>Our results substantiated BLA as the target of sweet cortex projections, and CEA as the target of bitter cortex projections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>; see Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> for activity-dependent labeling).</s></p><p><s>The amygdala is a key brain structure involved in processing emotions, motivation, and positive and negative stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s><s>Previous studies showed that BLA and CEA both contain distinct populations of neurons that are activated by negative or positive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s><s>Our finding of such strong segregation of appetitive (sweet) versus aversive (bitter) projections to the amygdala immediately suggests an anatomical division for the generation of valencespecific behavioral responses to tastants.</s></p><p><s>If the amygdala imposes valence to tastants (i.e. it represents the hedonic value of a tastant to drive valence-specific behaviors), then optogenetic activation of the terminals of sweet cortical neurons in the BLA should elicit attractive responses, while activation of bitter projections should evoke aversive behaviors.</s><s>Therefore, we generated mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> in either the sweet or bitter cortical field, implanted optical fibers over the amygdala, and used a place-preference test to measure responses to photostimulation of the cortico-amygdalar projections.</s><s>Our results (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>), showed that animals avoid the chamber linked to photostimulation of the bitter cortico-amygdalar projections, but exhibit strong preference for the chamber associated with stimulation of the sweet projections.</s></p><p><s>Next, we reasoned that optogenetic activation of the terminals of sweet cortical neurons in BLA should trigger appetitive taste behaviors, whereas stimulation of the projections from bitter cortical neurons in CEA should instead impose a negative valence on the stimulus.</s><s>Thus, we assayed whether ChR2-activation of sweet-to-BLA projections while an animal is drinking a neutral stimulus (e.g.</s><s>water) transforms it into a highly attractive one like sugar, and conversely, if activation of the projections from bitter cortex to CEA trigger strong laserdependent suppression of licking, much like introduction of a bitter chemical would do.</s></p><p><s>We used a behavioral paradigm where ChR2-expressing animals were assayed for water drinking in a head-restrained setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>In these experiments, the laser shutter was placed under contact-licking operation, hence, the animal has control of its own stimulation during the light on-trials, and only self-stimulation would continue to trigger appetitive responses (i.e.</s><s>light stimulation on its own does not trigger "licking, or licking-like motor responses; see Methods) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, an animal would immediately terminate licking if contact-licking elicited aversion.</s><s>Our results demonstrated that optogenetic activation of the sweet cortex terminals in BLA evoked dramatic increase in licking (i.e.</s><s>self-stimulation; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>), while activation of the bitter cortical projections to amygdala strongly suppressed licking responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>To confirm that these light-triggered behaviors were not caused by back-propagation of action potentials from the stimulation in the amygdala (i.e.</s><s>back to the taste cortex and thus to other potential taste cortical targets), we repeated the experiment, but this time we pharmacologically silenced synaptic activity locally in the amygdala by infusion of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Our results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>) demonstrated that silencing synaptic transmission in the amygdala abolished all light-evoked responses.</s><s>Importantly, responses fully recovered after washout of the drug (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results demonstrate that activation of sweet or bitter cortico-amygdalar pathways is sufficient to impose a positive or a negative valence on a neutral taste cue.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that strong activation of the bitter-and sweet cortico-amygdalar projections might override the hedonic response elicited by sweet and bitter tastants.</s><s>Therefore, we predicted that optogenetic activation of the bitter cortical terminals in CEA may impose an aversive response to an orally applied sweet tastant, while strong light stimulation of sweet terminals in BLA might suppress aversion to an orally applied bitter.</s><s>We used a behavioral test where thirsty animals expressing ChR2 in bitter or sweet cortex were exposed to random presentations of water, a bitter chemical or a sweet solution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>).</s><s>Next, we examined the impact of photoactivating bitter cortico-amygdalar projections by placing the stimulating optical fiber over the amygdala of the animals expressing ChR2 in bitter taste cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref> demonstrates that stimulation of bitter targets in amygdala is indeed sufficient to transform the appetitive nature of a sweet tastant into an aversive one.</s><s>Conversely, by photoactivating the amygdala targets of sweet taste cortex it was possible to change the perceived valence of a bitter tastant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>These results highlight the key role of the amygdala in imposing valence to a taste cue.</s><s>To examine the effect of taste stimulation in the absence of amygdala function, we carried out a number of amygdala silencing studies.</s></p><p><s>First, we used a behavioral assay that relies on direct stimulation of taste cortex.</s><s>In one group of animals, we introduced ChR2 into neurons in the sweet cortical field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a</ref>), bilaterally injected an AAV encoding inhibitory DREADD receptors into amygdala neurons for chemogenetic silencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> (see methods for details), and tested the animals before and after clozapine N-oxide (CNO) injection.</s><s>Importantly, ChR2 and the stimulating fiber are both in sweet cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a</ref>), and since sweet neurons project to many targets (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1a</ref>), the full repertoire is likely to be co-activated upon stimulation of the sweet cortical field.</s><s>Remarkably, silencing the amygdala is sufficient to abolish all attractive responses associated with activation of sweet cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5b</ref>); equivalent results were obtained using pharmacological inhibition of amygdala with NBQX rather than inhibitory DREADD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5c</ref>).</s><s>We repeated similar studies but this time examined activation of bitter cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5d</ref>).</s><s>Our results showed that silencing amygdala is also sufficient to abolish aversive responses associated with activation of bitter cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we reasoned that the valence associated with sweet and bitter tastants delivered to the tongue, rather than direct stimulation of taste cortex, should also be compromised.</s><s>As predicted, the results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5g</ref>-i demonstrate that silencing the amygdala dramatically impairs the behavioral attraction or aversion to sweet and bitter chemicals.</s></p><p><s>Previously, we showed that silencing the sweet or bitter cortex prevented the recognition of sweet or bitter tastants, while optogenetic activation of those same cortical fields triggered prototypical sweet-and bitter-associated behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>We reasoned that if tastant identity and valence are encoded in separate neural substrates, with taste cortex responsible for imposing identity to a tastant, and the amygdala for affording its valence, then animals with silenced amygdala should still recognize the identity of a sweet or bitter taste stimulus, even if blind to its hedonic value.</s></p><p><s>We trained mice to report the identity of a tastant by using two different behavioral assays: a three-port test and a Go/No-go assay.</s><s>In the three-port test, mice learned to sample a taste cue from a center spout (random presentations of water, a sweet or a bitter chemical), and then report its identity either by going to the right or left port; a correct response was rewarded with 4 seconds of water (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6a</ref>).</s><s>We initially focused on attractive responses as they represent the expression of a selective, positive behavioral response.</s><s>After 20-30 sessions of training over 10-14 days (see Methods for details), trained mice: (1) were able to report the identity of each tastant in hundreds of randomized trials with over 90% accuracy (see for example Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6b</ref>); (2) properly cross-generalized to other sweet and bitter tastants (not used in the training set) with the correct behavioral response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6b</ref>, compare training to testing), and (3) appropriately reported direct optogenetic activation of sweet taste cortex as "sweet", with ~90% of the water + light trials producing correct responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6c</ref>, "Pre" silencing; see also Ref 7).</s><s>Next, we assayed whether silencing amygdala via inhibitory DREADD to BLA affected the ability of these animals to correctly identify a sweet stimulus.</s><s>Our results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6c</ref>) demonstrated that loss of amygdala function, while abolishing the ability of sweet cortex to evoke appetitive responses (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a-c</ref>), has no impact on the ability of the animals to properly identify sweet tastants (or to recognize light-activation of sweet cortex as "sweet").</s><s>As anticipated, inhibitory DREADD expression in sweet cortex (just as previously shown using NBQX <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ), severely impairs sweet taste recognition (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The second behavioral platform relied on Go/No-go behavioral assays, and examined both sweet and bitter recognition.</s><s>Thirsty animals were trained to sample a test tastant from a spout, and then to report its identity either by licking (go) or withholding licking (no-go;
