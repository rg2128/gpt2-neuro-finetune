areas of the brain, and are often treated as different from cognitive states of consciousness, such as those related to the perception of external stimuli.</s><s>We argue that conscious experiences, regardless of their content, arise from one system in the brain.</s><s>In this view, what differs in emotional and nonemotional states are the kinds of inputs that are processed by a general cortical network of cognition, a network essential for conscious experiences.</s><s>Although subcortical circuits are not directly responsible for conscious feelings, they provide nonconscious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences.</s><s>In building the case for this proposal, we defend a modified version of what is known as the higher-order theory of consciousness.</s></p><p><s>fear | amygdala | working memory | introspection | self M uch progress has been made in conceptualizing con- sciousness in recent years.</s><s>This work has focused on the question of how we come to be aware of our sensory world, and has suggested that perceptual consciousness emerges via cognitive processing in cortical circuits that assemble conscious experiences in real-time.</s><s>Emotional states of consciousness, on the other hand, have traditionally been viewed as involving innately programmed experiences that arise from subcortical circuits.</s></p><p><s>Our thesis is that the brain mechanisms that give rise to conscious emotional feelings are not fundamentally different from those that give rise to perceptual conscious experiences.</s><s>Both, we propose, involve higher-order representations (HORs) of lowerorder information by cortically based general networks of cognition (GNC).</s><s>Thus, subcortical circuits are not responsible for feelings, but instead provide lower-order, nonconscious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences by cortical circuits (the distinction between cortical and subcortical circuits is defined in SI Appendix, Box 1).</s><s>Our theory goes beyond traditional higher-order theory (HOT), arguing that self-centered higherorder states are essential for emotional experiences.</s></p><p><s>Emotion, Consciousness, and the Brain Detailed understanding of the emotional brain, and theorizing about it, is largely based on studies that fall under the heading of "fear."</s><s>We will therefore focus on this body of work in discussing emotional consciousness.</s><s>In light of this approach, we define "fear" as the conscious feeling one has when in danger.</s><s>Although our conclusions may not apply equally well to all emotions, we maintain that the lessons from fear provide general principles that can at least be used as a starting point for theorizing about many emotions.</s></p><p><s>The Amygdala Fear Circuit View.</s><s>Emotions like fear are often said to have been

that damage to the amygdala disrupts the ability of animals and people to respond to threats behaviorally and physiologically <ref type="bibr">(13-15, 17, 19, 20)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, functional

by activating a fear circuit centered on the amygdala, and this same circuit controls the behavioral and physiological responses elicited by the threat; these responses are often called fear responses

is an aversive state of mind," the major driving force of which is a "subcortical FEAR system" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>Others, like Perusini and Fanselow <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, agree that danger elicits fear and fear causes behavior, but they do not treat it as a subjective experience; for them, fear is a brain state that intervenes between threats and defensive behaviors.</s><s>It is, in fact, common in behavioral neuroscience to construe animal and human behavior as being caused by so-called central states rather than by subjective experiences, while at the same time retaining the subjective state term <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>.</s><s>This approach allows animal research to be relevant to the human experience of fear, but leads to much confusion about what researchers mean when they use the term "fear" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although we agree with those who argue that it is inappropriate to call upon subjective experiences to explain animal behavior, we maintain that subjective experience is a seminal part of human existence and is indispensable in the effort to

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Although emotions, or feelings, are the most significant events in our lives, there has been relatively little contact between theories of emotion and emerging theories of consciousness in cognitive science.</s><s>In this paper we challenge the conventional view, which argues that emotions are innately programmed in subcortical circuits, and propose instead that emotions are higher-order states instantiated in cortical circuits.</s><s>What differs in emotional and nonemotional experiences, we argue, is not that one originates subcortically and the other cortically, but instead the kinds of inputs processed by the cortical network.</s><s>We offer modifications of higher-order theory, a leading theory of consciousness, to allow higher-order theory to account for self-awareness, and then extend this model to account for conscious emotional experiences.</s></p><p><s>evolutionarily conserved defensive survival circuits that account for the behavioral and physiological responses to threats, but that are not directly responsible for subjective experiences of fear, accomplishes this goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The Defensive Survival Circuit View.</s><s>Defensive survival circuits are evolutionarily wired to detect and respond to innate threats and to respond to novel threats that have been learned about in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>.</s><s>As viewed here, defensive survival circuits indirectly contribute to the feeling of fear, but their activity does not constitute fear.</s><s>The amygdala-centered circuit described above is an example of such a defensive survival circuit.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref> illustrates the defensive survival circuit view, relative to the fear circuit view, of amygdala contributions to threat processing.</s></p><p><s>That the defensive survival circuit is separate from the circuit that gives rise to the conscious experience of fear is suggested by several lines of evidence.</s><s>First, it is well established that conscious feelings of fear and anxiety are poorly correlated with behavioral and physiological responses, such as those controlled by defensive survival circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>If the same circuit was involved the correlation should be strong.</s><s>Second, studies using subliminal stimulus presentation methods (e.g., backward masking or continuous flash suppression) to prevent or reduce awareness of visual stimuli show that visual threats activate the amygdala and elicit body responses despite the fact that participants deny seeing the stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref

target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Under such conditions, participants do not report feeling fear, even when explicitly instructed to be introspective about what they are experiencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</s><s>Third, "blindsight" patients, who lack the ability to consciously see visual stimuli in a particular area of visual space, exhibit amygdala activation and physiological responses to visual threats presented in that part of space despite denying seeing the stimulus and without reporting fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> (see SI Appendix, Box 2 for a discussion of blindsight and other neurological patients that have contributed to consciousness research).</s><s>Fourth, although damage to the amygdala interferes with bodily responses to threats, it does not interfere with conscious experience of emotions such as fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>.</s><s>These findings all suggest that the amygdala-defensive survival circuits processes threats nonconsciously <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>.</s><s>This does not mean that defensive survival circuits play no role in conscious fear: they modulate the experience of fear, but are not directly responsible for the conscious experience itself.</s></p><p><s>How, then, does the conscious experiences of fear come about, if not as the product of an innate subcortical circuit?</s><s>We argue below that fear results from the cognitive interpretation that you are in a dangerous situation, one in which physical or psychological harm may come to you.</s><s>As such, an emotional experience like fear comes about much the same as any other conscious experience: as a result of processing by the GNC.</s><s>However, these circuits process different inputs in emotional vs. nonemotional conscious experiences, and in different kinds of emotional experiences.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consciousness in Contemporary Philosophy, Cognitive Science, and Neuroscience</head><p><s>In recent years empirical findings in cognitive science and neuroscience have helped reshape views of what consciousness is and how it comes about.</s><s>In discussing this research we will emphasize consciousness as a subjective experience, as opposed to the condition of an organism simply being awake and responsive to sensory stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Measuring Conscious Experiences.</s><s>Essential to researching consciousness as subjective experience is some means of measuring internal states that cannot be observed by the scientist.</s><s>The most common method is the use of verbal self-report <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48)</ref>.</s><s>This allows researchers to distinguish conditions under which one is able to state when they experience a sensory event from when they do not.</s><s>Verbal self-report depends on introspection, the ability to examine the content of one's mental states <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>.</s><s>Introspection, in turn, is believed to involve such cognitive processes as attention, working

type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Nonverbal behavior is satisfactory for demonstrating that a human or other animal is conscious in the sense of being awake and responsive to stimuli, and for demonstrating cognitive capacities underlying working memory, attention, metacognition, problemsolving ability, and other indicators of intelligent behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>.</s><s>However, because not all cognitive processing leads to conscious experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref><ref

nonverbal behavior alone are generally not sufficient to demonstrate conscious awareness (for further discussion of the measurement of consciousness through verbal and nonverbeal means, see SI Appendix, Box 3, and for discussion of nonconscious cognition, especially nonconscious working memory, see SI Appendix, Box 4).</s></p><p><s>Neural Correlates of Reportable Conscious Experiences.</s><s>Evidence has mounted in recent years implicating specific brain circuits in introspectively reportable conscious experiences of visual stimuli in humans.</s><s>For example, when self-reports of the stimulus are compromised by using subliminal stimulation procedures, such as masking <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref>, areas of the visual cortex (including primary and secondary areas) are functionally active, but when participants are able to consciously report seeing a visual stimulus, additional cortical areas become active <ref type="bibr"

target="#b70">(71)</ref>.</s><s>Most consistently implicated are various areas of the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, but activations are also reported in the parietal cortex and insular cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>These cortical areas are, not surprisingly, components of the GNC <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(73)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(74)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(75)</ref>.</s><s>Related findings come from blindsight patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref> who, because of damage to the visual cortex, are unable to report on the presence of visual stimuli in the part of visual space processed by the damaged area of the cortex, despite being able to respond nonverbally to the stimulus.</s><s>When the stimulus is in the part of space they can see and report on, cortical areas of the GNC are activated, but when it is in the blind area these areas are not activated <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77)</ref>.</s><s>Although the imaging studies in healthy people and blindsight patients suggest correlates of consciousness, other studies show that disruption of activity in GNC areas, especially in the prefrontal or parietal cortex, impairs conscious awareness of visual stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(79)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(80)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Phenomenal Consciousness.</s><s>A key idea that pervades discussions of consciousness is phenomenal experience.</s><s>In the most general sense, so-called phenomenal consciousness is just the property of there being something that it is like for one, from one's point of view, to be in a particular state <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(81)</ref>.</s><s>When I consciously experience pain, or see red, there is something that it is like, and that something can only be known through experience.</s><s>The specific phenomenal properties of an experience, sometimes called "qualia," are said to A B Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s><s>Two views of amygdala contributions to threat processing.</s><s>In the fear circuit view (A) the amygdala is responsible for both the subjective experience of fear and the control of so-called "fear responses."</s><s>In the defensive survival circuit view (B) the amygdala controls defensive responses but is not responsible for subjective experiences elicited by threats.</s></p><p><s>be the specific aspects or contents of the conscious stream of experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82)</ref>.</s><s>Explaining consciousness in the phenomenal sense is the (in)famous "hard problem" of consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(83)</ref>.</s><s>To address the hard problem is to provide an account of how it is that phenomenal consciousness emerges from brain activity: to explain why all of the information processing in the brain is not going on "in the dark," in the so-called cognitive unconscious <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>First-Order vs. Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness.</s><s>A key issue is whether introspection captures the nature of our phenomenally conscious experiences.</s><s>Ned Block <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(84)</ref> has argued that introspection only reveals those aspects of consciousness to which we have cognitive access, what he calls "access consciousness."</s><s>Phenomenal consciousness, according to Block, is a more fundamental level of experience that exists separately from and independent of cognitive access.</s><s>The difference between phenomenal and access consciousness can be illustrated by considering firstorder vs. higher-order theories of consciousness.</s></p><p><s>First-order theorists, such as Block, argue that processing related to a stimulus is all that is needed for there to be phenomenal consciousness of that stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(85)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(86)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(87)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(88)</ref><ref

initial HOR).</s><s>For example, Rosenthal uses introspection to refer to situations when one is attentively and deliberately focused on one's conscious experiences.</s><s>He argues that this additional state (the HOR of the HOR) is considerably less common than simply noticing one's experiences, and thus that introspection is not a key part of normal, everyday consciousness <ref

result.</s><s>Following Armstrong <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(120)</ref>, we argue that introspection can involve either passive noticing (as, for example, in the case of consciously seeing a ripe strawberry on the counter) or active scrutinizing (as in the case of deliberate focused attention to our conscious experience of the ripe strawberry).</s><s>Both kinds of introspection, in our view, lead to phenomenal experience.</s><s>Thus, as we use the term "introspection," the HOR that is responsible for consciousness on the traditional HOT would count as passive introspectively

HOTEC extends HOT and HORROR theory to account for the self.</s><s>In HOTEC, the difference between an emotional and nonemotional state of consciousness is accounted for by the kinds of inputs processed by the GNC.</s><s>Red lines show circuit interactions that are especially important in emotional states.</s><s>Red text indicates states/events that occur during emotional but not nonemotional experiences.</s><s>See main text for additional details.</s><s>Emo-HOR, emotional higher-order representation; MTL, medial temporal lobe; WM, working memory.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WM (non</head><p><s>However, although self-HOROR is necessary it is not sufficient for an emotional experience.</s><s>Self-HOROR can be purely cognitive (your personal knowledge that there is a pencil present and that it is you that is looking at this pencil) or emotional (there is a snake present and you are afraid it may harm you).</s><s>What accounts for this difference?</s><s>This takes us to the second set of circuits that contributes to fear: defensive survival circuits.</s></p><p><s>Activation of defensive circuits during an emotional experience results in various consequences that provide additional kinds of inputs to working memory, thus altering processing in the in the GNC in ways that do not occur in nonemotional situations (20) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>).</s><s>For one thing, outputs of the amygdala activate arousal systems that release neuromodulators that affect information processing widely in the brain, including in the GNC.</s><s>Amygdala outputs also trigger behavioral and physiological responses in the body that help cope with the dangerous situation; feedback to the brain from the amygdala-triggered body responses (as in Damasio) also change processing in many relevant circuits, including the GNC, arousal circuits, and survival circuits, creating loops that sustain the reaction.</s><s>In addition, the amygdala has direct connections with the sensory cortex, allowing bottom-up attentional control over sensory processing and memory retrieval, and also has direct connections with the GNC.</s><s>These various effects on the GNC may well influence topdown attentional control over sensory processing, memory retrieval, and other cognitive functions.</s><s>The GNC is also important in regulation over time of the overall brain and body state that results from survival circuit activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">167,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">168)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Unlike in traditional HOT, where there is somewhat of a hierarchical, or serial, relation between lower-and higher-order cortical circuits, in HOTEC the amygdala represents an additional lower-order circuit that can be activated in parallel with, and even independent of, the GNC.</s><s>For example, subcortical inputs from visual or auditory areas of the thalamus can activate the amygdala before and independent of the GNC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>.</s><s>This finding suggests that direct amygdala activation, say by deep brain stimulation, might produce subjective experiences related to fear.</s><s>Some claim that findings from such stimulations show that fear experiences are directly encoded in the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>However, the subjective consequences of brain stimulation are not necessarily encoded by the neurons stimulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">169)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the vague nature of the verbal reports in these studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(170)</ref> are less consistent with induction of specific emotional experiences than with the possibility that activation of body or brain arousal by amygdala outputs could, along the lines proposed by Schachter <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(171)</ref>, induce a distressing state of dissonance that is cognitively interpreted and labeled as fear or anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>This information, together with the observation that amygdala damage (see above) does not eliminate fear experiences, suggest that fear can exist independent of the lower-order inputs.</s><s>Whether such experiences are different, either quantitatively or qualitatively, because of the absence of the consequences of amygdala activation, is not known.</s></p><p><s>One additional factor needs to be considered.</s><s>An emotion schema is a collection of information about a particular emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(172)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(173)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(174)</ref>.</s><s>A fear schema, for example, would include factual information (semantic memories) about harmful objects and situations, and about behavioral and body responses that occur in such situations.</s><s>Thus, if you find yourself in a situation in which a harmful stimulus is present (a threat), and notice, through self-monitoring, that you are freezing and your heart is racing, these factors will likely match facts associated with fear in the fear schema and, through pattern completion, activate the fear schema.</s><s>The schema will also include factual memories about how to cope with danger, and episodic memories about how you cope with such situations, which will bias the particular thoughts and actions used to cope.</s><s>Emotion schema are learned in childhood and used to categorize situations as one goes through life.</s><s>As one becomes more emotionally experienced, the states become more differentiated: fright comes to be distinguished from startle, panic, dread, and anxiety.</s><s>When an emotion schema is present as part of a HOR, it biases the content of the experience that the HOR will support.</s><s>Thus, an autonoetic emotional experience of fear is based on an emotional HOROR that includes the self (a fear self-HOROR).</s><s>Of particular note is that the presence of a vague threat or physiological arousal, as noted above in relation to brain stimulation, may be sufficient to induce pattern completion of the fear schema.</s></p><p><s>Tulving argued that autonoetic consciousness is an exclusive feature of the human brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(135)</ref>.</s><s>Other animals could, in principle, experience noetic states about being in danger.</s><s>However, because such states lack the involvement of the self, as a result of the absence of autonoetic awareness, the states would not, in our view, be emotions.</s></p><p><s>Another unique feature of the human brain that is relevant to self-awareness is natural language.</s><s>Language organizes experiences into categories and shapes thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(175,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">176)</ref>.</s><s>Words related to various emotions are an important part of the emotion schema stored in memory.</s><s>More than three-dozen words exist in English to characterize fear-related experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(177)</ref>.</s><s>It has long been thought that language influences experience (178), including emotional experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">(179,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">180)</ref>.</s><s>Language also allows symbolic representation of the experience of emotions without the actual exposure to the stimuli that normally elicit these emotions (181).</s><s>Damasio's (6, 117) notion of "as-if loops" and Rolls's "if-then syntactic thoughts" (169) are consistent with this idea.</s><s>Although the ability to imagine emotions is useful, this can also become a vehicle for excessive rumination, worry, and obsessions.</s><s>If self-awareness and emotion can exist without language, these are surely different when the organism has language.</s></p><p><s>We have emphasized here how defensive circuits can contribute to conscious emotional feelings of fear.</s><s>This makes it easy to slip into the idea that a defensive survival circuit is a fear circuit.</s><s>However, the feeling of fear can occur in response to activity in other survival circuits as well (e.g., energy, fluid balance, thermoregulatory circuits); in relevant circumstances, you can fear dying of starvation, dehydration, or freezing to death.</s><s>We call these fears (or "anxieties") because they are triggered by specific stimuli and interpreted in terms of stored schemas related to danger and harm to well-being.</s><s>An emotional experience results from the cognitive representation of situations in which you find yourself, in light of what you know about such situations from past experiences that have provided you with factual knowledge and personal memories.</s></p><p><s>One implication of our view is that emotions can never be unconscious.</s><s>Responses controlled by subcortical survival circuits that operate nonconsciously sometimes occur in conjunction with emotional feelings but are not emotions.</s><s>An emotion is the conscious experience that occurs when you are aware that you are in particular kind of situation that you have come, through your experiences, to think of as a fearful situation.</s><s>An important question to consider is the function of fear and other states of emotional awareness.</s><s>Our proposal that emotions are cognitive states is consistent with the idea that once they are assembled in the GNC they can contribute to decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">169)</ref>, as well as to imaginations about one's future self and the emotions it may experience, and about decisions and actions one's future self might take when these emotions occur.</s><s>This notion overlaps with a proposal by Mobbs and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">164)</ref>.</s><s>Emotion schema, built up by past emotions, would provide a context and set of constraints for such anticipated emotions.</s><s>In the short-term, anticipated emotions might, like the GNC itself, play a role in top-down modulation of perceptual and memory processing, but also processing in subcortical survival circuits that contribute to the initial assembly of the emotional state.</s><s>Considerable evidence shows that top-down cognitive modulation of survival circuits occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">167,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">168)</ref>, and presumably emotional schema within the GNC, could similarly modulate survival circuit activity.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In this paper we have aimed to redirect attention from subcortical to cortical circuits in the effort to understand emotional consciousness.</s><s>In doing so, we built upon contemporary theorizing about perceptual consciousness in philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, and especially on the debate between first-and higher-order theories, in an effort to account for how feelings arise as a result of introspective awareness of internal information.</s></p><p><s>Using the emotion of fear to illustrate our views, we argue that in the presence of a threat different circuits underlie the conscious feelings of fear and the behavioral responses and physiological responses that also occur.</s><s>The experience of fear, the conscious emotional feeling we propose, results when a firstorder representation of the threat enters into a HOR, along with relevant long-term memories-including emotion schema-that are retrieved.</s><s>This initial HOR involving the threat and the relevant memories occurs nonconsciously.</s><s>Then, a HOROR allows for the conscious noetic experience of the stimulus as dangerous.</s><s>However, to have the emotional autonoetic experience of fear, the self must be included in the HOROR.</s><s>In typical instances of fear, these representations are supplemented by the consequences of activation of subcortical survival circuits (not just defensive circuits but any circuit that indicates a threat to well-being).</s><s>However, as noted earlier, fear can occur when the defensive survival circuit is damaged.</s><s>Furthermore, existential fear/anxiety about the meaningless of life or the eventuality of death may not engage survival circuits at all.</s><s>Our theory can thus potentially account for all forms of fear: those accompanied by brain arousal and bodily responses and those that are purely cognitive and even existential.</s><s>Although we have focused on fear, we believe that the basic principles involved can be leveraged to understand other emotions as well.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 4.
