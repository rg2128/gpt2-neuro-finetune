<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jefferis et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>The anterodorsal and lateral lineages produce uniglomerular, cholinergic, and excitatory PNs (adPNs and lPNs), whereas the ventral lineage produces GABAergic inhibitory PNs (vPNs), some of which target dendrites to multiple glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jefferis et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Liang et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>We sequenced 1046 single GH146+ cells at 24-30 hours after puparium formation (h APF).</s><s>At this stage, PNs are refining their dendrite targeting in the antennal lobe; these dendrites also serve as targets for ORN axons that will invade the antennal lobe and establish one-to-one connections in the following 24 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jefferis et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>We analyzed 946 cells that passed quality filtering (STAR Methods).</s></p><p><s>Conventional dimensionality reduction and clustering methods based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Maaten and Hinton, 2008)</ref> identified only ~12 distinct PN clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>The inability to resolve more distinct clusters is likely due to the limited sensitivity of these methods to distinguish cell types with highly similar transcriptomes, as we expect for the PN classes.</s><s>To address this challenge, we developed an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, Iterative Clustering for Identifying Markers (ICIM), to identify genes that distinguish PN classes.</s><s>ICIM searches for genes having the highest expression variability within a cell population, partitions the cells into two subpopulations using clustering based on these genes, then iteratively repeats the search on each subpopulation.</s><s>Iteration continues until distinct subpopulations cannot be separated because gene expression patterns within the population are homogeneous (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>Stopping criteria are defined in an unbiased manner without supervision.</s><s>Genes identified using ICIM were then used for further dimensionality reduction using tSNE and clustering using HDBSCAN, a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Campello et al., 2013)</ref>, on the tSNE space.</s><s>Applying ICIM to the transcriptomes of GH146+ PNs, we identified 561 genes that segregate the 946 GH146+ cells into 35 distinct clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Two of the 35 clusters expressed known markers for vPNs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>): Gad1+, a GABA biosynthetic enzyme, and Lim1+, a transcription factor expressed in vPNs but not adPNs or lPNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Komiyama and Luo, 2007)</ref>, suggesting that they correspond to vPNs.</s><s>Besides PNs, the only other cells that GH146-GAL4 also consistently labeled at a high level at 24h APF were the anterior paired lateral (APL) neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C</ref>).</s><s>Three other clusters expressed VGlut (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>), which specifically marked GH146+ APL neurons but not PNs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2D</ref>), suggesting that this VGlut+ population consists of APL neurons.</s><s>Because we were interested primarily in excitatory adPNs and lPNs, we removed inhibitory vPNs and APL neurons from subsequent analysis.</s><s>Nearly all of the remaining 902 GH146+ cells should be adPNs and lPNs, which collectively target 40 glomeruli.</s><s>Clustering analysis using ICIM and tSNE identified 30 distinct clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Library complexity and sequencing depth did not drive clustering (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>).</s><s>The number of cells belonging to each cluster varied from 5 to 108, likely reflecting the fact that different PN classes contain different cell numbers ranging from 1 to 7 cells per antennal lobe <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Yu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lin et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>It is likely that we did not sample a sufficient number of cells to detect rare PN classes.</s></p><p><s>We previously showed that two transcription factors, Abnormal chemosensory jump 6 (Acj6) and Ventral veins lacking (Vvl; also known as Drifter), are expressed in adPNs and lPNs, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), and instruct lineage-specific dendrite targeting <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Komiyama et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, our single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that acj6 and vvl were expressed in a mutually exclusive manner (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref> and S2F).</s><s>Among the 30 clusters of adPNs and lPNs, 18 clusters (60%) expressed acj6 but not vvl, and thus represent adPNs.</s></p><p><s>The remaining 12 clusters were likely lPNs.</s></p><p><s>In summary, single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed distinct clusters of GH146+ adPNs and lPNs expressing lineage markers in a manner consistent with prior knowledge.</s><s>Transcription factor transcripts, whose protein levels are generally low <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003)</ref>, were reliably detected within PNs and could be used to assign lineage identity, supporting the specificity and sensitivity of this method.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Iterative Clustering for Identifying Markers (ICIM)</head><p><s>To identify subpopulations of cells corresponding to PN subtypes, we developed an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, Iterative Clustering for Identifying Markers, which we call ICIM.</s><s>We observed that standard dimensionality reduction and clustering methods using PCA and tSNE failed to discriminate subpopulations that corresponded to known PN lineages and molecular features.</s><s>We attributed the failure of these methods to the high degree of similarity of transcriptional states among PN subtypes, which represent closely-related neurons having similar functions.</s><s>All PN subtypes are born from one of the two common progenitor cells (neuroblasts) and have similar functional roles in the adult fly.</s><s>Thus, PN subtypes may be distinguished by a small number of genes.</s></p><p><s>In the language of machine learning, the performance of dimensionality reduction and clustering methods depends critically on feature selection.</s><s>Selection of informative genes that vary among cell types can improve discrimination in dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis.</s></p><p><s>We developed ICIM as a strategy to identify the most informative genes for distinguishing subpopulations within a population of closely-related cells in an unbiased way.</s><s>Starting with a population of cells, we first identify the top 100 overdispersed genes within this population.</s><s>Next we expand this set of genes by finding genes whose expression profiles are strongly correlated with the overdispersed genes (Pearson correlation &gt; 0.5).</s><s>We also filter this set of genes by (1) removing those having fewer than 2 correlated partners, and (2) those that are expressed in &gt;80% of cells.</s><s>Filter (1) removes noisy genes based on the idea that genes that carry information about cell type are expressed within gene modules and therefore have expression profiles that are correlated with at least one other gene.</s><s>Filter (2) removes housekeeping genes that are detected in nearly all cells, and have variation in expression levels due to biological and technical noise, but this variation is not informative for purposes of distinguishing cell types.</s><s>Cells are then clustered based on their expression profiles of these genes (average-linkage clustering using correlation metric).</s><s>We cut the dendrogram at the deepest branch and partition the population into two subpopulations.</s><s>The same steps are then performed iteratively on each subpopulation.</s><s>Iteration continues until a population cannot be split into subpopulations because it is "homogeneous".</s><s>The termination condition is defined as the minimum terminal branch length (the most similar nearest-neighbor correlation distance between the expression profiles of cells) being larger than 0.2.</s><s>This condition arises when the algorithm attempts to discover genes within a homogeneous population and finds a very large number of genes (typically &gt;1000 genes) that vary in an incoherent manner between cells.</s><s>When the algorithm terminates, we collect all genes that were identified at any stage.</s><s>The result of this analysis is a set of genes that discriminate subpopulations within a population, which can be used for dimensionality reduction (as described above).</s><s>We note that this algorithm identifies informative genes in an unbiased manner without knowledge of the ground truth of the number of cell types and their differences.</s><s>The results of the algorithm were robust across a wide range of parameters.</s></p><p><s>Why does ICIM outperform previously used approaches, such as PCA? PCA reduces the feature space in a manner that assigns weights to genes based on their information content.</s><s>This has two consequences: (1) downstream analysis uses the weighted gene expression information, which imposes assumptions about the statistical relationships between genes, and (2) while less informative genes are assigned smaller weights, they nevertheless can contribute to downstream analysis.</s><s>In contrast, ICIM explicitly removes genes that are deemed uninformative from further consideration and assigns equal weights to those that are kept.</s><s>These attributes make ICIM a more effective feature selection strategy for analysis of highly similar cellular subtypes.</s></p></div>

dropouts can hinder the identification of unique markers.</s><s>We therefore estimated the probability that our failure to identify unique markers can be accounted for by dropout.</s><s>To do so, we assumed that each of the 30 molecularly distinct GH146+ PN subtypes expresses a single unique marker gene at a low level of expression ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>CPM) in a ubiquitous fashion (i.e. in all the individual cells belonging to that subtype).</s><s>In our data, genes expressed at an average level of 7 CPM are not detected in ~60% of cells.</s><s>We can fail to detect a gene because (1) the cell is not expressing the gene, or (2) because of noise in gene expression (biological noise) or technical dropout (measurement noise).</s><s>We therefore can estimate an upper bound at 60% on the probability of dropout of a gene that is expressed at 7 CPM on average.</s><s>Our approach for identifying unique markers requires that the gene is detected in 80% of cells within a cluster.</s><s>The probability of failure to detect the marker gene for a given cluster due to dropout is therefore given by the probability of dropouts in 20% of the cells in a cluster.</s><s>This probability is:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P failure = P dropout ^Ndropouts</formula><p><s>where P dropout is estimated to be 60% and N dropouts = 0.2 * N cells is the number of cells in which the gene must drop out.</s><s>We calculated this probability based on the number of cells N cells in every cluster, ranging from 5 to 108.</s><s>Then we calculated the probability that 25 out of 30 clusters do not have a unique marker gene by multiplying the probabilities of failure in 25 randomly sampled clusters.</s><s>We performed this sampling 10,000 times and report the average (P = 10 -62 ).</s><s>This value represents the probability of failing to detect a unique marker gene for 25 out of 30 clusters given that each cluster is expressing a single unique marker at 7 CPM.</s></p><p><s>These calculations are conservative in several ways.</s><s>First, we assumed that each cluster expresses a single marker gene.</s><s>Realistically, each subtype may express multiple unique markers.</s><s>This would increase the probability of detecting at least one of them.</s><s>Second, unique markers may be expressed at levels higher than 7 CPM.</s><s>We observed that the unique marker genes that we discovered are expressed at levels well above 7 CPM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S6A</ref>) and biologically it is unlikely that a type identity factor would
