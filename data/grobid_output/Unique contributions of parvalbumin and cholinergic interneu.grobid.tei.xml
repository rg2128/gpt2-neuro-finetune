ganglia, the dorsal striatum serves as a point of integration between cortical and sub-cortical regions that transforms information provided by these inputs to an output signal that guides behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) are the major target of these inputs as well as the primary source of projections from the striatum.</s><s>These cells comprise roughly 95% of all striatal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , and are traditionally classified based on the target of their output in the Globus Pallidus and the presence of dopamine D1 (direct pathway) or D2 (indirect pathway) receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Imbalance between these pathways is thought to contribute to the expression of motor pathologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Despite having disparate projection pathways and being differentially regulated by dopamine, recent calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging studies suggest that these two unique MSNs populations could be uniformly engaged during movement and share a remarkably similar activity profile during normal locomotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> .</s><s>These recent findings suggest that coordinated activity in D1 and D2 MSN population supports normal voluntary movement, and disrupting the balance of activity between these two pathways contributes to disease pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>The mechanisms underlying this coordination are less well understood, although they likely include contributions of local interneurons.</s></p><p><s>In addition to MSNs, the dorsal striatum also contains multiple populations of interneurons, each of which represent only a small fraction of the total population of cells (&lt;5% per type) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Though few in number, each interneuron class has the potential to shape striatal activity and function through its innervation of the MSN projection network <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Two of the best characterized striatal interneurons are the parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) and cholinergic interneurons (CHIs).</s><s>PVs are GABAergic and can provide a potent source of inhibition on the activity of nearby MSNs to support motor control <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</s><s>CHIs are a major source of striatal acetylcholine (ACh) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>These extensively arborized cells can directly modulate the activity state of MSNs via muscarinic ACh receptors expressed by both D1 and D2 populations of MSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , and have likewise been implicated in normal control of motor output <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The unique roles of PVs and CHIs in generating the MSN network dynamics that support movement remain unknown.</s><s>Efforts to understand how sparsely distributed striatal interneurons interact with MSNs to support behavior have been hampered by a lack of experimental approaches that allow for the simultaneous monitoring of genetically defined interneuron populations in combination with large numbers of MSNs.</s><s>To gain further insight into interneuron-MSN interactions in support of movement, we utilized a wide-field calcium imaging platform that enabled us to monitor and optogenetically manipulate interneurons, while simultaneously recording calcium dynamics in hundreds of surrounding MSNs in mice during voluntary locomotion.</s><s>We find that PV and CHI interneuron types differ from one another, and from MSNs, in how they contribute to movement and how they regulate populations of MSN networks that guide behavior.</s><s>PV interneurons best predict movement and reduce the level of MSN population activity in the dorsal striatum during movement events.</s><s>CHIs, in contrast, have a more selective role in recruiting and synchronizing the activity of MSNs during movement to suppress or end a movement bout.</s><s>Our combined evidence demonstrates the unique capacity of different classes of striatal interneurons to organize networks of MSNs in support of discrete aspects of voluntary locomotion.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Striatal activity during locomotion</head><p><s>We found that the bulk striatal fluorescence (averaged activity across all cells) increased during periods of movement (high speed) and decreased during periods of no or low movement (low speed, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>, E, Video S1).</s><s>For this reason, we focused our analyses around the time of movement onsets as well as peaks in velocity.</s><s>In a typical 10 min recording session, 15-20 such locomotion events occurred (Chat-Cre mice, 20.1±4.1 onset events, n=6 mice; PV-Cre mice, 14.9±3.0,</s><s>n=6 mice; mean±SEM), with the average period of high movement velocity lasting 5.1±0.1 (mean±SEM) seconds.</s><s>Individual MSN calcium events showed a sharp increase and an exponential decay (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> (top; for representative traces).</s><s>Over all, calcium events were most frequent in MSNs of the three neuron types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), and had the greatest amplitude (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>).</s><s>Similar to recent imaging experiments in genetically defined populations of D1 and D2 MSNs, we found that the vast majority of MSNs exhibited a sharp increase in fluorescence at movement onset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>), although we did detect a proportion of MSNs that were either negatively (21.4%), or non-modulated (24.2%) by movement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>As a population, MSN fluorescence rose coincident with movement onset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D-E</ref>), peaked coincident with maximum velocity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>-G), and then declined as movement slowed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D-E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Calcium events in PV cells were slow to rise and long lasting (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> (middle), 2C; S2B-C; Video S2), consistent with calcium responses previously noted in PV neurons from cortical regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Like MSNs, PVs overwhelmingly exhibited increases in fluorescence around motion onset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D-E</ref>; while only 13.9% of the PV population were negatively modulated at movement onset; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3C</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref> for a full characterization of positively and the small subset of negatively modulated PVs).</s><s>The increase in PV activity preceded MSNs by 523.1±304.3ms</s><s>(mean±SEM; n=13 sessions, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S6</ref> for individual examples and supplemental methods for details).</s><s>Indeed, PV cells also showed the highest proportion of neurons positively modulated in the 500ms before movement onset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2H</ref>), providing further evidence for a rise in PV activity preceding motion onset and MSN activity.</s><s>Additional analyses showed that in the 1.5 s following a calcium event in the PV population, PVs calcium events were uniquely associated with a positive change in velocity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>; S2I).</s><s>Calcium events in CHIs had similar event rates across periods of movement as PVs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), and had the smallest area under the curve of all neuron classes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> (bottom), 2C), despite having similar rise times and event widths as MSNs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B-C</ref>).</s><s>As a population, CHIs showed a modest, but not statistically significant increase in fluorescence at motion onset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D-E</ref>).</s><s>Rather, CHI population fluorescence reached maximum intensity approximately 2 seconds after peak velocity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>-G, Video S3).</s><s>Analysis of changes in movement speed following CHI calcium events further indicated that speed dramatically declined following CHI calcium events (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>;
