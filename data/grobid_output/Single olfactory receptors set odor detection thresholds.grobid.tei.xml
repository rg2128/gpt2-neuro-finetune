behavioral thresholds have not been clearly answered.</s><s>Our approach is unique because it combines genetic deletion of well-characterized, high affinity receptors with rigorous behavioral thresholding.</s></p><p><s>We find that deleting the highest affinity receptor alters behavioral threshold and that threshold is solely dependent on the most sensitive receptor.</s><s>Note that we have not tested whether the most sensitive TAAR alone (in the absence of all other ORs) can support the same sensitivity.</s><s>Overall, our findings are reminiscent of a "lower envelope" model in which behavioral threshold is dictated solely by the most sensitive afferents, in contrast to a pooling model in which behavioral threshold is determined by combining inputs of variable sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>The concept of pooling was originally put forth to address how reliable behavioral responses emerge from inherently noisy and unreliable single neurons.</s><s>It makes sense that a lower envelope scheme (across glomeruli) could work in olfaction, since the system may have solved the issue of noise in single sensory neurons by pooling functionally similar inputs via glomerular convergence.</s><s>Our data indicate that information coming in via the most sensitive input (glomeruli) is sufficiently reliable to impart a given detection threshold.</s><s>These findings further support the feasibility of models that emphasize the importance of the most sensitive receptors for olfactory coding <ref type="bibr"

respond to amines <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , albeit at much higher concentrations than our residual thresholds.</s><s>Nevertheless, the fact that removing the entire TAAR repertoire does not produce amine anosmia underscores the functional redundancy of olfactory sensory inputs.</s></p><p><s>Our data also argue that a similar degree of functional redundancy can be seen in TAARs and ORs.</s><s>The single TAAR deletion produced ~3-7-fold shifts in sensitivity to their preferred ligands, while the deletion of the class II OR (Olfr1440) produced a similar ~3-fold shift to muscone.</s><s>Thus, single TAARs and ORs contribute similarly to sensitivity.</s><s>While TAARs exhibit ultrahigh sensitivity to amines <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , it is important to note that behavioral thresholds to the amines are within ten-fold of the those measured for methyl valerate and muscone, implying that ORs have comparable sensitivities as TAARs to their preferred

the sensitivity shift to muscone was reported to be several orders of magnitude-much larger than what we observe.</s><s>The difference in effect size is likely attributable to the different methods used to measure sensitivity.</s><s>The previous study used an investigation-based assay in untrained, freely moving mice.</s><s>This approach does not permit rigorous control of odor concentration, is difficult to quantify, and investigation times are confounded by factors not related to sensitivity (e.g., perceived intensity, valence, and motivation).</s><s>In fact, assessing sensitivity of our

perform the detection task; it is known that performance in detection tasks improves with training and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, mice are tested in hundreds of trials for each odor concentration, providing a robust estimate of sensitivity despite inevitable behavioral variability.</s><s>Our data provide a reliable measure of the detection limits of the olfactory system following specific genetic modifications.</s><s>It is possible that under natural conditions (with untrained animals in a noisy olfactory environment) the shifts in sensitivity that we observe might manifest as marked deficits in odor localization.</s></p><p><s>The sensitivity of single TAAR glomeruli as measured by calcium

action potentials in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, under our imaging conditions, the convergence of thousands of OSNs to single glomeruli may facilitate visualization of fluorescence changes to near threshold odor concentrations.</s><s>The concordance between these two measures is consistent with our observation that the highest affinity receptor sets the behavioral detection for the animal.</s></p><p><s>In addition, the shift in phenylethylamine threshold with TAAR4 deletion (~7-fold) closely matched the difference in sensitivity between TAAR4 and TAAR3 glomeruli measured via imaging.</s><s>This observation argues that, in the absence of the highest affinity receptor (TAAR4), behavioral sensitivity is set by the second highest affinity receptor (TAAR3).</s><s>Thus, the concordance between the imaging and behavior is also consistent with the idea that behavioral sensitivity is set solely by the most sensitive receptor.</s></p><p><s>In mammals, the TAARs make up roughly 1% of the main olfactory receptor repertoire, yet they are highly conserved across species, perhaps reflecting a critical, universal role in olfactory function.</s><s>The TAARs have been shown to mediate the detection of social cues or kairomones in mice, but such species-specific roles do not explain their broad conservation.</s><s>Here we show for the first time that the TAARs set the behavioral detection thresholds of mice to amines.</s><s>Our data suggest that the TAARs may be evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates because they are the

<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>One potential explanation for this loss of response is that TAAR deletion mice no longer detect the amines.</s><s>However, our current study shows that TAAR deletion mice can still detect amines, albeit with reduced sensitivity.</s><s>Unfortunately, a direct comparison of the stimulus concentrations in the present and earlier studies is not straight forward since the method of odor delivery is different (flow dilution olfactometry vs. liquiddiluted odorants presented in open dishes).</s><s>However, it is worth noting that ΔTAAR4 mice initially fail to avoid concentrations of phenylethylamine (presented in open dishes) that they subsequently detect and avoid following aversive conditioning (our unpublished observations).</s><s>Thus, our data do not preclude the idea that TAARs play a crucial role in defining the identity, perceived intensity, and/or valence of amines, while also setting the detection threshold to these odorants.</s></p><p><s>Previous work has suggested that behavioral sensitivity may be determined in part by the

should be noted again that our results are collected using a highly controlled odor source and well-trained mice that perform thousands of trials.</s><s>Thus, it is possible that receptor overexpression might increase sensitivity under more natural conditions (untrained animals that encounter fluctuating olfactory stimuli in the presence of background odors).</s><s>Regardless, our data provide evidence that, in a wellcontrolled setting, a typical complement of highest affinity glomeruli is sufficient to translate the sensitivity of specific molecular receptors into a behavioral detection threshold.</s></p><p><s>Overall, our results argue that, among the &gt;1000 main olfactory GPCRs, the TAARs are the most sensitive to amines.</s><s>Thus, it seems likely that this

conservation.</s><s>More broadly, the fact that a single olfactory receptor gene (either a TAAR or an OR) can make a significant contribution to behavioral sensitivity suggests a mechanism by which olfactory receptors could be under selective pressure, thus shedding light on how vertebrates maintain large olfactory receptor repertoires over evolutionary time.</s></p></div>
