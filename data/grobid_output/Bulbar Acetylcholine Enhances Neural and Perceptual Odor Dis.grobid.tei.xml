<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present experiments show a correspondence between the modulation of mitral cell odor responses and behavioral odor discrimination by activation of cholinergic receptors in the olfactory bulb.</s></p><p><s>Activation of cholinergic receptors in the olfactory bulb significantly increased the number of mitral cells responding differentially to pairs of aliphatic odorants differing by a single carbon in their chain as well as behavioral discrimination between these odorant pairs.</s><s>Cholinergic pathways have traditionally been associated with attentional mechanisms: in the present framework, increased cholinergic activity enhances perceptual discrimination by changing neural stimulus representations, a phenomenon that can be interpreted as increased attention.</s></p><p><s>The organization of the olfactory system is such that spatially distributed olfactory sensory neurons, expressing common olfactory receptors, converge unto one or a few common glomeruli.</s><s>Localization of mitral cells that respond to families of odorants are shown to be distributed in particular regions of the OB

the corresponding olfactory bulb area <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Davison and Katz, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fantana et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Mitral cells interact with each other via local interneurons, many of which are the targets of central and neuromodulatory inputs (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shipley and Ennis, 1996)</ref>, enabling the modulation of odor representations by these central and neuromodulatory inputs.</s></p><p><s>The OB receives strong cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain via the nucleus of the HDB that innervates primarily glomerular and granule cell layers of the bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heimer et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kasa et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Activation

2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pressler et al., 2007)</ref>; these are well segregated with a low degree of overlap, whereby nicotinic receptors are typically located within the glomerular and mitral cell layer, whereas muscarinic receptors predominate the plexiform and granule cell layers.</s><s>Cholinergic neuromodulation in the MOB, including both nicotinic and muscarinic components, has been hypothesized previously to regulate the discrimination of similar odorants (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Linster and Cleland, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>For example, intraperitoneal injections of physostigmine, an acetycholinesterase inhibitor, were found to enhance odor discrimination between extremely similar odorant stimuli in a rewarded forced-choice task <ref type="bibr"

<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mandairon et al., 2006b)</ref>.</s><s>Our electrophysiological findings show that odor discrimination is enhanced at the level of mitral cell spiking responses when cholinergic receptors are activated during odor stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Our behavioral observation shows that enhancement of bulbar cholinergic modulation increases olfactory discrimination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Blockade of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors abolished the enhanced discrimination observed in mitral cells, suggesting that both receptor types participate in the modulation of mitral cell responses.</s><s>Behavioral experiments support these results in that they show that blockade of both receptor types decreases spontaneous discrimination, more particularly the discrimination between aliphatic odorants differing by one or two carbons.</s><s>In contrast, in a reward-conditioned task, blockade of muscarinic receptors did not affect odor discrimination, whereas blockade of nicotinic receptors did.</s><s>Interestingly, a previous experiment from our group, using a more limited odor set and a different conditioned task, showed that addition of a muscarinic antagonist to a low dosage of a nicotinic antagonist, not effective by itself, decreased spontaneous discrimination between chemically similar odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mandairon et al., 2006b)</ref>.</s><s>Given that the electrophysiologically measured effects on odor discrimination are weaker for muscarinic receptor blockade (no significant difference between neostigmine and scopolamine induced effects on the number of cells discriminating between chemically similar odorants), it may be that the role of muscarinic receptors is secondary to those of nicotinic receptors and can only be seen in the absence of rewardmediated motivation or when nicotinic action has been disturbed.</s><s>Overall, the effects of cholinergic blockade were much larger when spontaneous, unmotivated discrimination was tested, supporting the idea that the activation of cholinergic receptors in the olfactory bulb shapes odor representations, in a manner that affects perception but not to the extent of preventing the learning of an odor-reward association (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>However, potential benefits of increased cholinergic action in the MOB may not appear in the reward-motivated behavioral task because control rats do not significantly confuse the conditioned and test odorants.</s><s>These data are supported by previous experiments showing that pairs of odorants not spontaneously discriminated by rats can be rendered discriminable by reward-driven learning as well as by daily exposure to odorants <ref type="bibr">(Linster et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mandairon et al., 2006a)</ref>.</s><s>Reward-driven odor learning may be accompanied by changes in odor representations at multiple levels of the olfactory system and activate plasticity mechanisms other than cholinergic modulation.</s><s>Global interruption of cholinergic modulation, by either systemic injections or specific lesions of cholinergic neurons, have been shown previously to affect reward-driven learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Doty et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Rosa et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Linster et al., 2001a)</ref>, suggesting that cholinergic inputs to the olfactory bulb proper, modulated in the present experiments, may underlie different functionalities than those acting on other olfactory centers.</s><s>More specifically, cholinergic modulation in the OB would specifically modulate odor representations, whereas cholinergic modulation in olfactory cortical areas have been shown to modulate synaptic plasticity and odor reward learning (for review, see <ref type="bibr">Linster and Hasselmo, 2001)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Brain-slice experiments have shown that activation of nicotinic receptors both directly depolarizes mitral cells while simultaneously increasing their inhibition by periglomerular cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Castillo et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>A recent computational model showed that these two phenomena can act together to increase the sparseness of mitral cell odor responses and to increase the degree of discrimination between chemically similar odorants at this level of mitral cell spiking activity <ref type="bibr"

modulates a subset of periglomerular cells <ref type="bibr">(Pignatelli and Beluzzi, 2008)</ref> in the glomerular layer.</s><s>The authors found that muscarinic ACh activation increased membrane hyperpolarization, via potassium channel activation, in dopaminergic periglomerular cells, leading to a decrease in spike activity in modulated cells.</s><s>Together, the effects of muscarinic

result from nicotinic and muscarinic receptor activation is one of limiting mitral cell responsiveness to odorants by increasing inhibitory action at the glomerular tuft, narrowing the olfactory
