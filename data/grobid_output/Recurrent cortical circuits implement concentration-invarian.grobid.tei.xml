Odor-evoked spiking in FFIs increased slowly and only slightly after inhalation, suggesting that FFIs may provide tonic inhibition driven by spontaneous OB input but do not play a major role in shaping phasic, odor-evoked cortical responses.</s><s>This result is not entirely unexpected because although these cells do receive broadly tuned OB input, they are even more broadly self-inhibited <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, spiking in FBIs, but not FFIs, increased systematically with concentration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, H</ref> and<ref type="figure">I</ref>), suggesting that they play the major role in normalizing PCx output, which is consistent with predictions from our recent modeling study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, FBIs appear to play the dominant role in truncating and suppressing odor-evoked activity in the PCx.</s><s>Because FBIs do not get OB input but instead are recruited by intracortical recurrent collateral connections, these data indicate that it is PCx activity itself that initiates its subsequent, rapid suppression, determining what OB information is transmitted and what information is effectively ignored.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recurrent excitation suppresses odor responses</head><p><s>To unilaterally eliminate recurrent circuitry, we injected AAV-DIO-TeLC-GFP at three different locations along the rostro-caudal axis, uniformly infecting ~60% of principal neurons across the PCx (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, A and B, and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>We then recorded odor responses simultaneously in the PCx from infected and contralateral control hemispheres (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>).</s><s>Spontaneous firing rates in TeLC-infected (TeLC-PCx) and contralateral control hemispheres were similar.</s><s>Population spiking was more strongly coupled to the respiration cycle in both TeLC-PCx and ipsilateral OB, indicating that cortical network activity normally desynchronizes spiking in both the PCx and OB (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>Despite eliminating much of its excitatory input, odor responses in TeLC-PCx were enhanced, increasing steeply after inhalation and remaining elevated for the duration of the sniff (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, D to E).
