<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>A familiar object evokes a complex pattern of activity in the brain, but it is possible that only a structured subset of this activity, representing critical combinations of sensory attributes, is essential for recognition.</s><s>A key challenge is to identify the subspace of neural activity that induces the percept.</s><s>This activity may consist of multiple spatial or temporal features, such as which cells respond and when they respond, relative to stimulus onset or each other.</s><s>Do individual features contribute differentially to the formation of the percept?</s><s>For example, the activity of some cells in a pattern may be more important than others.</s><s>Does the formation of the percept depend on how features are combined?</s><s>The sequential activation of multiple cells or the latency of their activation relative to brain rhythms are examples of feature combinations that may be perceptually meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The difficulty in addressing these questions is two-fold.</s><s>First, multiple features co-vary with perceptual responses, making it difficult to disentangle their independent contributions to perception.</s><s>Previous studies have mainly focused on correlating neural activity with perception, where the contributions of individual features are entangled.</s><s>Second, we lack a single framework for quantitatively comparing the perceptual contributions of individual and combined features.</s><s>For example, we know from causal manipulation studies that single neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(4)</ref> or small timing differences (5-7) can affect perception, but not their relative importance and how they come together in larger patterns to produce perception.</s></p><p><s>Here we developed a novel framework for finding the perceptually-meaningful spatiotemporal subspace of neural activity.</s><s>We optogenetically manipulated individual activity features independently of other features, manipulated combinations of features, and compared the effects of all manipulations under a common metric.</s></p><p><s>We used mouse olfaction as our model system to study these questions, as odor perception is correlated with complex spatio-temporal activity patterns, and these patterns can be optogenetically manipulated in mice while measuring their perceptual responses.</s><s>Odor-induced activity recruit glomeruli, discrete neuropils in the olfactory bulb which collect receptor inputs from the nose, grouped by receptor type.</s><s>Spatio-temporal combinations of glomerular activity correspond to unique odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9)</ref>.</s><s>Both the spatial identity or temporal latencies of glomeruli activated in the pattern may be perceptually meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7)</ref>, but the relative importance of each is unknown.</s><s>It is also unclear what forms a perceptually-meaningful combination of glomerular activation: ordered sequences aligned relative to each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>, sequences aligned to sniff rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14)</ref>, or the earliest activated subset of glomeruli within a sniff rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To understand how features of glomerular activity combine to produce perception, we first trained mice to recognize synthetic odors: optogenetically-driven spatiotemporal patterns of glomerular activity.</s><s>We then performed precise spatial or temporal perturbations on trained patterns and measured how recognition changes.</s><s>Changes in recognition reflect the perceptual relevance of the modified feature (or groupings of features).</s><s>We modelled recognition as the matching of glomerular activity to learned templates, and uncovered what forms a perceptuallymeaningful pattern template: activation sequences ordered by latencies relative to each other (latencies relative to sniff contribute little), with greater perceptual importance carried by the earlier glomeruli in the sequence.</s><s>Spatially-identified glomeruli within the sequence contribute additively to perception, with minimal interactions between spatial identities.</s><s>Template matching with these perceptually-meaningful features can account for animals' responses, with the degree of mismatch predicting changes in recognition.</s><s>Hence, by performing precise and parametric manipulation of glomerular activity and quantifying effects under a common metric, we derived a unifying model that explains how odor perception arises from structured glomerular activation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We first characterized the basic behavioral and neural responses to optogenetic stimulation.</s><s>We chronically implanted OMP-ChR2-YFP mice (n=6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref> with cranial windows to expose dorsal olfactory bulb, and performed optogenetic stimulation using a digital micromirror device system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Similar to previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17)</ref> and consistent with known anatomy, mitral/tufted (MT) cells were activated by few localized spots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>We observed instantaneous MT cell firing rates up to ~100 Hz, with excitatory responses lasting around ~80 ms, comparable to odorevoked responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>.</s><s>We verified that spots at the same stimulation parameters were perceptually detectable, but only for ChR2-positive mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), and without systematic spatial biases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>We then used the same basic stimulation parameters for the main experiments.</s></p><p><s>We trained mice to discriminate Target versus Non-target synthetic odors on a two-choice task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>While the stimulation patterns we used are unlikely to correspond to specific known chemical odorants, our patterns follow stimulation durations and activation latencies that fall within known odor-evoked distributions of glomerular activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Mice learned to discriminate a fixed Target from any random Non-target pattern over weeks, while ChR2negative mice did not (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We then performed systematic spatial and/or temporal perturbations within Target patterns on a small number (10%) of probe trials, and measured perceptual responses.</s><s>Perturbations consisted of replacing spots with Non-target spots, or shifting spots in time.</s><s>For any set of perturbations, we measured the fraction of trials where the mouse makes a lick choice towards the water spout associated with the Target ('like-Target' response), as opposed to the Non-target spout.</s><s>This measurement reflects perceptual distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19)</ref>: the perceived difference between the perturbed and original Target pattern.</s><s>The larger the perceptual distance, the lower the fraction of like-Target responses.</s><s>We performed a basic check that perceptual distances should increase as Target patterns are altered.</s><s>In pilot mice trained on the task, we systematically decreased the laser intensity below the intensity used during training.</s><s>As the laser intensity for Target patterns was lowered, animals showed a graded decrease in like-Target responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s><s>We found that spatial perturbations led to graded changes in perceptual distances, dependent on the timing of the spot perturbed.</s><s>To perform spatial perturbations, we kept Target pattern timing fixed while replacing spots with random Non-target spots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>One or more spots in Target patterns were replaced in every possible combination of the six spot positions.</s><s>We found a graded relationship between the number of spots replaced and perceptual distance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Spot replacement effects also depended on spot timing: replacing earlier-activated spots had a greater effect than later-activated spots, both within single-spot or multiple-spot replacement trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>We refer to this temporal dependence as 'primacy' <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>.</s><s>We additionally found that the effect of spot replacement depends on spatial distance on the olfactory bulb.</s><s>The perceptual distance is small between a Target, and a Target with one spot replaced by a proximal spot.</s><s>This perceptual distance is larger when the new, replacing spot is distant from the old, replaced spot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with studies suggesting that close-by glomeruli may be more likely to be chemically, and hence perceptually, related, at least on a coarse scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21)</ref>.</s><s>We cannot completely rule out the alternative possibility that these effects may arise from activating fibres of passage, with strength of activation dependent on distance.</s><s>However, these effects are likely to be weak given our observed mitral cell responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) and also previous reports using similar stimulation parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Temporal perturbations also led to graded changes in perceptual distances dependent on the timing of the spot perturbed.</s><s>To perform temporal perturbations, we shifted one or more spots of the Target pattern in 10 ms increments, in randomly-chosen combinations of spot and shift magnitude (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>We found that increasing the overall amount of temporal shift (defined as</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Euclidean shift = 𝛥𝑡 ! ! !</formula><p><s>where  ! are individual spot shifts) led to an increase in perceptual distance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Similar to spatial perturbations, temporal perturbations also exhibit primacy.</s></p><p><s>In trials where only one spot was shifted, shifting earlier-activated spots has stronger effects than shifting later-activated spots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we observed an asymmetry in temporal shift effects: shifting spots earlier -towards the beginning of the sniff cycle, has a stronger effect than shifting spots later -towards the end of the sniff cycle.</s><s>This asymmetry is consistent with primacy: while later-activated spots are less important perceptually, shifting them earlier may interfere with the early, more important spots, hence inducing larger behavioral effects.</s><s>a strong initial side bias (see Methods).</s><s>Blue stars indicate performance of control, ChR2negative mice after &gt;40 sessions of training.</s><s>G. Effect of laser intensity on pattern recognition for mice previously trained to discriminate Target vs Non-target patterns.</s><s>Probability of like-Target responses (mean and SEM across mice) on probe trials with randomly chosen low intensity Target patterns (black) and Non-target patterns (red).</s><s>Horizontal dashed lines correspond to baseline responses to Target and Non-target patterns.</s><s>To quantify the effect of spatial and temporal perturbations, we performed regression analyses using either binary variables for spot replacement ( !</s><s>= 1, if the spot is replaced and  !</s><s>= 0, if not), or continuous variables for temporal shifts ( ! ).</s><s>The regression models quantify primacy in spatial perturbations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>), and primacy and asymmetry for temporal perturbations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>).</s><s>Primacy is reflected in larger magnitude coefficients for earlier spots; temporal asymmetry is reflected in larger magnitude coefficients for shifting spots earlier as opposed to later.</s><s>Regression fits are presented in all data plots as blue lines (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>,E&amp;F), and responses of individual mice are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The effects of temporal perturbations suggest that animals encode spot latencies referenced to sniff: as spots were shifted with respect to inhalation onset, animals' responses changed.</s><s>An alternative possibility is that spot latencies are encoded with respect to other spots in the pattern.</s><s>To test this, we considered the synchronous shift of the Target pattern, where all spots are shifted by the same amount with respect to inhalation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Synchronous shifts alter sniffreferenced timing while keeping pattern-referenced timing constant.</s><s>We found that perceptual distances vary, but only weakly, with synchronous shifts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Critically, we attempted to predict the effect of any synchronous shift, by summing the effects of single spots shifted by equal amounts referenced to inhalation.</s><s>The prediction significantly over-estimates the weak perceptual effect of synchronous shifts, suggesting an important role for pattern-referenced timing.</s><s>Pattern-referenced timing can also be reflected in the order or sequence of spot activation.</s><s>We found that order-changing temporal perturbations had a larger effect than orderpreserving perturbations, controlling for equivalent amounts of sniff-referenced shift from the plotted by spot position.</s><s>G. Regression coefficients showing the effect of replacing each spot in all trials, including single or multiple spot replacement.</s><s>Negative coefficients imply that replacing the spot lowers like-Target responses, coefficients of zero imply no effect on responses.</s><s>H.

similar centroid measures have been defined to characterize the mean response latency across multiple neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>.</s><s>To perform within-channel comparisons, the model measures the amount of non-overlap between waveforms.</s><s>Critically, this comparison is done in reference to each template's center-of-activity.</s><s>Consider synchronous shifts of Target patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>): only the center-of-activity changes, but not waveforms relative to the center-of-activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>Hence, within-channel comparisons are primarily sensitive to changes in pattern-referenced timing as opposed to sniff-referenced timing.</s><s>The choice of using a centroid model for pattern-referenced timing was further corroborated by regression analyses showing that the centroid model best predicts responses to temporal perturbations, compared to other models (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S2</ref>).</s><s>Within-channel comparisons are also sensitive to differences in spatial activations, for example in the spot replacement of patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>The non-overlap per channel is then linearly summed across all channels to produce an overall channel difference value.</s><s>Channel differences and the difference in center-of-activity are separately weighted, then combined to produce perceptual distances.</s></p><p><s>The STM model succeeds at predicting animals' responses to the whole spectrum of pattern perturbations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>) and reproduces the observed trends for individual perturbations (Fig. !"#$%! ,  !</s><s>!"#$% ) and their absolute difference,</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Δ𝑇 ! = 𝑇 ! !"#$%! -𝑇 ! !"#$%</formula><p><s>, are calculated.</s><s>Individual waveforms are then aligned to their respective pattern's center-of-activity, and the difference in non-overlapping area per waveform channel is integrated.</s><s>This non-overlapping area is summed linearly across all channels (Δ channels).</s><s>Δ ! is exponentiated, weighted, then added to the weighted Δ channels value, producing a perceptual distance value.</s><s>A logistic function on perceptual distances produces a probability of making a like-Target response to the given Probe pattern.</s><s>5A).</s><s>The model captures the graded effects of both spatial and temporal perturbations, with primacy in spatial perturbations, and primacy and asymmetry in temporal perturbations.</s><s>The model also captures the weak effects of synchronous shifts.</s><s>We further confirmed that changing any component in the model decreases model performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The STM model essentially performs a linear readout of spatial channels, as within-channel differences are summed up linearly without added interactions between channels.</s><s>If animals respond to patterns according to model predictions, the observed effects of spatial perturbations should also sum linearly.</s><s>This is because replacing spots while keeping timing fixed, produces only changes within channels (which are summed linearly) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>We directly tested if a simple linear readout could indeed account for animals' responses to spatial perturbations.</s><s>We compared a regression model containing only linear terms, versus a regression model allowing for non-linear effects.</s><s>The linear model performed better than the non-linear model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>, model error = 0.158 vs 0.16, p &lt; 0.001, t-test), and coefficients for non-linear interactions were negligible (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>).</s><s>Hence, the olfactory system performs a linear readout of spatial glomerular activity: glomeruli contribute additively to the overall percept, largely independently of the identity of the other activated glomeruli in the pattern.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, the STM model predicts strong temporal interactions between channel activations: shifting any spot changes the latencies of all other spots encoded in reference to the whole pattern.</s><s>Hence, the effect of shifting any spot depends on how other spots are shifted.</s><s>For example, the effect of synchronous shifts cannot be predicted from single spot shifts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We confirm the existence of temporal interactions with regression: a regression model allowing temporal interactions between spots, is superior to one that does not (model error = 0.1647 vs 0.1725, p &lt; .001,</s><s>t-test).</s><s>Critically, we found that the STM model run on a large simulated dataset of random temporal perturbations produces the same pattern of temporal interactions as observed in the data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>, pearson correlation = 0.83).</s></p><p><s>We then quantitatively compared the STM model to the best regression model fitted separately for each individual class of spatial or temporal perturbations.</s><s>The regression models form a standard for comparison, as they place minimal prior assumptions on the structure of the data.</s><s>Despite the STM model having fewer parameters than the regressions (6 vs 21), the STM model performs slightly better (prediction error = 0.159 vs 0.160 p &lt;.001, t-test).</s><s>Furthermore, for any given pattern, the STM model and regression models produce responses that are tightly correlated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref>); the correlation between models is greater than the correlation between the STM model and the data (r = 0.997 vs r = 0.97).</s><s>Hence, the STM model produces similar patterns of responses to regression analyses which could in principle to capture more complex relationships within the data.</s><s>This implies that the several key computations modelled by STM are sufficient to account for animals' responses.</s><s>We further validated the STM model with unseen classes of spatio-temporal perturbations.</s><s>In our described experiments and model fitting so far, Target pattern perturbations were either spatial or temporal, but not both.</s><s>We tested the fitted STM model on additional patterns containing both temporal shifts and spatial replacements within the same pattern.</s><s>We found that the model could predict animals' responses to spatio-temporal perturbations despite never encountering these manipulations during model fitting (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, prediction error on spatio-temporal perturbations = 0.23, spatial perturbations alone = 0.23, temporal perturbations alone = 0.21).</s><s>Another form of spatio-temporal perturbations is inherent in Non-target trials, where all Target spots were replaced and randomly shifted.</s><s>No Non-target pattern was ever repeated for each animal, guaranteeing that all Non-target stimuli in model fitting are distinct from Non-target stimuli in model testing.</s><s>The STM model was able to predict responses across different Non-targets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, error = 0.10).</s></p><p><s>Hence, spatio-temporal template matching of olfactory bulb activity, linearly summed, constrained by activity-centered timing, and with preferential weighting on early activations, can account for how the olfactory system maps complex activity to perceptual outputs.</s></p></div>

proposed that odors are encoded in unique spatial combinations of glomeruli ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>), but there are multiple possible combinatorial coding schemes which have not been tested.</s><s>For example, one extreme possibility is a 'barcode' representation, where any slight change to the combination leads to a completely un-related odor, maximizing the system's representational capacity for odors.</s><s>Instead, we found a perceptual readout of spatial patterns that is linear.</s><s>This is consistent with studies which imaged odorevoked glomerular activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref> or directly stimulated individual glomeuruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref>.</s><s>A linear readout implies that two patterns will generate odors that are perceptually similar depending on the degree of glomerular overlap.</s><s>While a linear readout has lower representational capacity, it may explain the generalization of odor percepts across varying concentrations or backgrounds, where activated glomeruli differ slightly.</s></p><p><s>Our work causally establishes the role of temporal sequences in odor perception, which has long been hypothesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13)</ref> but not directly tested: temporal codes are not theoretically required to support odor perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref>.</s><s>We presently demonstrated that mice trained to recognize a

activity by sniff-coupled mechanosensory responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, mice may be using the overall position of the pattern in sniff as a weak cue to solve the task, as the average randomly-generated Non-target pattern has a different position within sniff compared to the Target pattern.</s></p><p><s>We found a primacy effect where earlier-activated glomeruli have larger effects on perceptual responses.</s><s>Primacy has been suggested as a strategy for animals to recognize the same odor across varying concentrations, as early-activated glomeruli remain stable across different concentrations.</s><s>Animals trained to recognize odors across varying concentrations were impaired during coarse optogenetic disruption, but only when the disruption occurred in the initial ~100ms of inhalation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, animals were trained to recognize a single Target synthetic odor, and displayed a primacy effect without explicit training to 'concentrationvariants' of the Target.</s><s>Hence, the preferential weighting of early inputs occurs under different task demands, suggesting that primacy is a fundamental property of the olfactory system.</s><s>Primacy may be supported by downstream computations, at the level of mitral cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref> or piriform cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We cannot rule out the possibility that fibers of passage were activated during our spot stimulation.</s><s>However, this effect is likely to be weak-MT cells were activated by few localized spots at the laser intensity chosen for our experiments.</s><s>Another study also using OMP-ChR2 mice, with similar stimulation size, duration and intensity have also found negligible effects of fibers of passage <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Increasing the stimulation intensity led to more apparent recruitment of fibers of passage, reflected in increased number of active spots located anteriorly (unpublished).</s><s>Furthermore, we observed negligible non-linear interactions between spots during spatial replacements, which is not expected if there is widespread co-activation of glomeruli from fibres of passage.</s></p><p><s>Another limitation of the study is that our synthetic stimuli may not capture the full complexity of glomerular activity evoked by natural odors.</s><s>We instead view the synthetic approach as complementary to approaches using more naturalistic stimuli.</s><s>The claim is not that these synthetic stimuli are direct proxies for naturalistic stimuli-rather, synthetic stimuli afford wellcontrolled experiments with precise parameterization and causal manipulation, and can be used to establish basic principles of the neural code.</s><s>In other well-studied sensory systems, foundational understanding of sensory processing has been built upon synthetic, reduced stimuli (37), while naturalistic stimuli have been used to test and refine foundational models <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>.</s><s>Future

elucidate the specific circuit mechanisms for spatio-temporal template matching, by recording MT cells or piriform cortex responses to parametric patterned stimulation.</s><s>Specific parameters or operations in the model may eventually be mapped to specific circuit computations.</s><s>For example, the time constant in waveform activation, may strongly depend on rapid inhibition of MT cell
