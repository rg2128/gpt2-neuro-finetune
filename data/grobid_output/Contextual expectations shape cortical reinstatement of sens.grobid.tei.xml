being between predictions dependent on temporal continuity (e.g., a train moving from one location to another as it is driven), and predictions relating to upcoming items that are not in view.</s><s>This latter form of perceptual expectation must depend on coordinated responses between perceptual and contextual memory systems; however, the neural mechanisms of how memory systems might predict and reactivate perceptual details in cortex is elusive.</s></p><p><s>Expecting to see a specific visual stimulus generates responses in early visual cortex that resembles activity when perceiving the same stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kok et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kok et al., , 2014))</ref>, even if the expected item is never shown <ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b12">Brown et al., 2016)</ref>, suggesting that it might be a primary source of top-down predictions to reactivate expected sensory details.</s><s>This is supported by recent evidence from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kok and Turk-Browne (2018)</ref>, who showed that hippocampal responses reflected the expected stimulus following a predictive auditory cue, while visual regions reflected the perceived stimulus.</s><s>Such studies are beginning to reveal how memory and perceptual systems support prediction and perception, highlighting the hippocampal top-down effects on cortex.</s><s>While learned prior contexts must guide the prediction of future states, direct empirical support for such a contextually dependent hippocampal-cortical interaction remains limited.</s></p><p><s>Beyond primary sensory regions and the hippocampus, a network of posterior brain regions are implicated in item and context-based reactivations, including the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, and angular gyrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bar and Aminoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lee and Kuhl, 2016;</ref><ref

Ritchey, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ritchey and Cooper, 2020)</ref>.</s><s>The differing connectivity profiles of anterior and posterior hippocampus are linked to differential functional properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Poppenk et al., 2013)</ref>, leading us to predict that contextually driven reactivations will be present in the posterior hippocampus and PM network, with the reactivation of sensory details in primary visual cortex.</s><s>A further unexplored question is how the hippocampus, PM network, and visual cortex interact to support the prediction and reactivation of sensory patterns.</s></p><p><s>To explore these issues, we conducted an fMRI study where participants navigated through a learned space and saw predictable sequences of objects (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Critically, one-fourth of the sequence trials terminated early, where a specific item was expected, but instead a blank screen was presented.</s><s>Using pattern similarity (PS) analysis, we ask (1) which regions represent item information, (2) are item representations specific to the sequence context, and (3) do these regions also represent information about expected items, even if not shown.</s><s>To test how the hippocampus interacts with other regions, we used multivariate representational connectivity

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p><s>Stimuli.</s><s>The stimuli consisted of nine common animal images.</s><s>Each animal was represented by a color photograph, presented in isolation on a gray background.</s><s>The nine animals were positioned into a cross maze with two animals per arm and one in the central location, creating the first zoo called "San Francisco Zoo."</s><s>A second zoo was created, "San Diego Zoo," by mirror-reversing and rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise one zoo map to create the other.</s><s>Therefore, both zoos contained the same animals with the same transitional structure but a different global layout (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Training.</s><s>Participants initially underwent a training session to learn the animals and their locations within the two zoos.</s><s>To achieve this, participants completed map construction, exploration, and navigation trials for one zoo, with the process then repeated for the second (zoo order counterbalanced across participants).</s><s>During map construction, participants were shown the zoo layout and asked to arrange the animal images shown on screen into the correct positions.</s><s>During exploration, participants were shown the animal at the center of the maze and were free to move up/down/left/right to see how moving in different directions resulted in seeing a different animal.</s><s>After making nine moves, the exploration reset to the center animal to begin again.</s><s>Exploration continued until each animal was seen at least 4 times.</s><s>Next, participants navigated between positions in the maze.</s><s>They were shown a cue image indicating a start and a goal animal, followed by seeing the start animal.</s><s>The participant had to select the correct moves to reach the goal animal.</s><s>Start and goal animals were always located at the end points of an arm, and participants had a maximum of four moves.</s><s>If participants did not reach criterion during navigation, they repeated map construction and navigation.</s><s>After completing training with one zoo, the procedure was repeated with the second zoo.</s><s>After successfully completing training with both zoos, participants completed a final navigation task, including trials from both zoos and presented with the same structure and timings of the fMRI navigation task (see below).</s><s>All training and navigation tasks were presented using Psychtoolbox and MATLAB.</s></p><p><s>fMRI.</s><s>During fMRI scanning, participants performed the navigation task for both zoos in a blocked fashion across six scanning runs.</s><s>In each run, participants were told which zoo they were in and completed eight navigation trials for one zoo before switching to the other zoo.</s><s>A navigation trial consisted of seeing a cue screen showing the start and goal animal for 3 s, followed by a blank screen for 3 s.</s><s>The start animal was then displayed for 2 s followed by a 3 s blank screen.</s><s>After a response, the relevant animal was shown for 2 s followed by a 3 s blank screen, with the process continuing for a maximum of four moves.</s><s>After four responses were made, the participant was shown a feedback screen.</s><s>The participant was required to make their response within 2 s of the animal appearing; otherwise, the move was judged as incorrect and they were shown a text screen indicating "wrong move" for 2 s followed by a 3 s blank screen, and the animal was shown again.</s></p><p><s>Participants competed navigation trials for the 12 possible start and goal animal combinations in each zoo, with each navigation trial being repeated 3 times, resulting in 72 full navigation trials.</s><s>A total of 24 catch navigation trials were included where each navigation trial was terminated early, after the third animal (the central animal if correct responses were made), and instead of seeing the fourth animal, participants saw an additional blank screen lasting 6 s before a new trial began.</s><s>The order of zoos was counterbalanced both across runs and between participants.</s></p><p><s>Scanning acquisition MRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Skyra MRI using a 32-channel head coil.</s><s>Anatomical images were collected using a T1-weighted MPRAGE pulse sequence image (TR = 1800 ms; TE = 29.6 ms; flip angle = 7 degrees; 1 mm 3 isotropic voxels; 208 axial slices, TR = 2100 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, FOV = 256 mm).</s><s>Functional images were collected with a multiband gradient EPI sequence (TR = 1222 ms; TE = 24 ms; flip angle = 67 degrees; matrix = 64 Â 64, FOV = 192 mm; multiband factor = 2; 3 mm 3 isotropic spatial resolution).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data preprocessing</head><p><s>Preprocessing used SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).</s><s>Functional images underwent slice time correction, spatial realignment, and smoothing using a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.</s><s>To detect fast motion events, the ART repair toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mazaika et al., 2009)</ref> was used.</s><s>These spike events were used as nuisance variables within the GLMs.</s><s>Single-item b images were obtained by running a separate GLM for each object (LSS model) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Mumford et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>For each GLM, the item of interest was entered as a single regressor with 1 event, with an additional regressor for all other events.</s><s>All events were modeled as a 2 s boxcar and convolved with a canonical HRF.</s><s>Additional regressors were included for each spike event identified, 12 motion regressors (6 for realignment and 6 for the derivatives of each of the realignment parameters), and a drift term using a 128 s cutoff.</s><s>This resulted in five b images per full navigation trial (e.g., zebra, chicken, rabbit, horse, tiger) and four b images for each catch navigation trial (e.g., zebra, chicken, rabbit, omitted item).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PS analysis</head><p><s>ROI PS.</s><s>Our initial analysis focused on anatomic ROIs in early visual cortex and the hippocampus, both of which are suggested to support sensory expectations and predictions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hindy et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kok and Turk-Browne, 2018)</ref>.</s><s>A V1/V2 region was created from the functional atlas of visual cortex developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rosenke et al. (2021)</ref>, where V1 and V2 were combined into a single region, and inverse normalized to native space.</s><s>Probablistic maps of the hippocampal head, body, and tail were obtained from the multistudy group template <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Yushkevich et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These maps were warped to MNI space using DARTEL and thresholded at 0.5.</s><s>The resulting maps were then reverse normalized to each participant's native space using Advanced Normalization Tools.</s><s>The anterior hippocampus was defined as the hippocampal head, and the posterior hippocampus as the combined body and tail sections.</s><s>This division closely follows recommended anterior-posterior divisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Poppenk et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>An additional set of ROIs were tested, with the PRC and PHC defined from the multistudy group template <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Yushkevich et al., 2015)</ref>, and the temporal pole and posterior medial cortex (PMC; combined precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex) were generated using FreeSurfer (version 6) and warped to each participants native space.</s></p><p><s>PS was used to test three issues, whether regions represented: (1) the currently viewed item, (2) the item in a specific sequence context, and (3) the item that was expected but never shown.</s><s>Our analyses focused on the item in Position 4 of the sequence context, first because Position 4 items are always preceded by the same image in all sequences (i.e., a rabbit), meaning any impact of the preceding item on voxel patterns because of autocorrelation is controlled for.</s><s>Second, one-fourth of Position 4 trials were omitted with the trial ending early, allowing us to study the impact of expectations through these catch trials.</s><s>Third, Position 4 is also situated after a key decision point (Position 3), where it is possible to see multiple different animals following the central item (the rabbit), with the decision made at this point determines the next image.</s><s>Therefore, Position 4 allows us to both examine item-level effects while controlling for autocorrelation and recent visual effects, and predictive effects generated from the central decision point.</s></p><p><s>For item effects, we contrasted PS based on repetitions of the same Position 4 item against when the items were different (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>In order to control for sequence effects, PS was restricted to trials from the same sequence context and zoo, meaning that we are asking whether the items are dissociable within a specific sequence (although this does not control for the position within the sequence).</s><s>Same-item PS was calculated between all possible pairs of the same item-sequence-zoo items and averaged.</s><s>Different-item PS was calculated between pairs of items that were not the same but were from the same sequence context and zoo, before being averaged.</s></p><p><s>Item expectation effects were tested in the ROIs showing significant item effects, and were based on PS between the expected-but-omitted b image and the b image of trials where the same item was seen.</s><s>All omitted items were at Position 4 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, PS was calculated between each omitted item and the Position 4 trials where the same item was seen.</s><s>To do this, PS was first calculated between an item and an omitted item where they are matched for item, sequence context, and zoo, before calculating PS values when items are matched for item, but not sequence context and/or zoo.</s><s>This results in four PS values, which are averaged to give an overall PS between an item and when an item was expected but omitted.</s><s>Importantly, this value includes PS values containing all visual histories that converge on that Position 4 item.</s><s>Baseline PS values were calculated when the item and omitted item were because of different items, which will also have different visual histories.</s><s>This ensures that expectation effects are matched for the past items in the sequence, as all item expectation PS values will include data with all sequence histories.</s></p><p><s>In order to test for effects of sequence context (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>), first, PS was calculated using the Position 4 items between pairs of trials that shared the same item, sequence context and zoo.</s><s>Then we calculated PS when pairs of items shared the same item and same sequence, but from the other zoo.</s><s>These PS values were then averaged across the two zoos giving a PS reflecting the same items in the same sequence.</s><s>These PS values were contrasted with PS for the same items when in a different sequence (averaged across zoo).</s><s>We chose to average the PS values across the two zoos because here we are interested in sequence-level contexts, and not potential global zoo differences, meaning that our analyses focused on differences between the sequences without considering the two zoos (additional control analyses show no significant or marginal effects of zoo on sequence effects).</s></p><p><s>All PS values were calculated between pairs of items using Pearson's correlation, excluding items where an incorrect response was made, and excluding pairs of trials that occurred in the same scanning run <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Mumford et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>PS was calculated using all gray matter voxels within each ROI.</s></p><p><s>Multivariate connectivity.</s><s>We used a measure based on representational connectivity analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kriegeskorte et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anzellotti and Coutanche, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pillet et al., 2020)</ref>, an approach where PS in one region is correlated with PS in another region.</s><s>However, here we adapted this approach to assess connectivity both between regions and from different positions in the sequence.</s><s>This allowed us to test the degree to which PS in one region related to PS in another region at a different position in the trial.</s><s>Here, we tested whether PS in the hippocampus at Position 3 in the sequence was related to PS at Position 4 in cortical regions that showed item expectation effects.</s><s>To do this, we used a partial correlation analysis, whereby hippocampal PS from Position 3 was correlated with Position 4 PS from a second region, while controlling for PS from the second region at Position 3. The analysis tells us whether past information in the hippocampus can explain future information in cortex, over and above that explained by past information in that same cortical region.</s><s>Our analysis focused on PS between trials from the same sequence context, and same zoo (excluding across sequence/zoo PS), and only included PS values calculated between trials in different scanning runs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>PS values for item, sequence context, and expectation effects were calculated for each participant and each ROI, and tested using paired-samples t tests or one-sample t test against zero.</s><s>An FDR correction was applied to p values to control for the number of ROIs tested.</s><s>Multivariate connectivity was calculated for each participant and tested using a one-sample t test against zero.</s><s>In addition to this frequentist approach, we analyzed all contrasts using Bayesian one-or two-sample t tests in JASP (version 0.14.1),</s><s>where the null was defined as an RSA effect of 0, with a Cauchy prior width set to 0.707.</s><s>Bayes factors are reported, indicating the ratio of evidence supporting our hypothesis compared with the null hypothesis.</s></p></div>

(2020)</ref> have shown that, while hippocampal responses contained information about the expected stimuli when they were abstract perceptual shapes, it did not do so when the expected items were orientation gratings.</s><s>They suggest that, as with other regions within the MTL, stimulus complexity interacts with function.</s><s>In our study, we also find evidence for a predictive function of the hippocampus with sequences of complex meaningful images, shown through our connectivity analysis, although we find no evidence for item expectation effects in the hippocampus.</s><s>However, other recent evidence using the same dataset shows that the hippocampus does reflect future goals when the sequence is cued <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crivelli-Decker et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it will be important to determine how hippocampal predictions operate as a function of task state and stimulus complexity.</s><s>Importantly, although expectation effects are often also seen in early sensory regions, participants in our paradigm know the exact stimulus that will appear.</s><s>In real life situations, there can be much more uncertainty about what will be seen.</s><s>In these cases, predictions might not be related to a specific perceptual stimulus, and instead they might be more conceptual in nature, with expectation effects limited to higherlevel regions, such as the posterior ventral temporal cortex.</s><s>These more general contextual predictions are indeed claimed to constrain responses in posterior ventral temporal cortex, where predictions (or perceptual hypotheses) generated in the orbitofrontal cortex constrain activity in posterior regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Trapp and Bar, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This raises the important questions of how real-world contextual predictions and predictions of varying specificity modulate the strength and mechanism of hippocampal guided predictions.</s></p><p><s>It is long established that our past experiences impact our current perceptions.</s><s>The current study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of how top-down expectations can influence the visual processing of objects.</s><s>The current results advance our understanding of how the hippocampus and posterior cortical regions work together to support perceptual expectations and predictions of future states based on learned sequence contexts.</s><s>Further, our results help to bridge between research on the cortical manifestation of expectations, and research on predictive and contextual representations in the hippocampus.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure1.</s><s>Experimental design and analysis.</s><s>A, Participants learned the spatial layout of 9 animals in two distinct zoos.</s><s>B, During fMRI, participants navigated between 2 animals, seeing a predictable sequence of images.</s><s>In one-fourth of trials, the sequence ended early where a specific item was expected, but instead a blank screen was shown.</s><s>C, Item effects were established by comparing activity patterns when seeing the same item in the same sequence and same zoo (red arrow), with patterns for different items within the same sequence context and zoo (gray arrows).</s><s>D, Sequence effects were established by comparing activity patterns between the same items seen in the same sequence, against patterns when the same item was seen in a difference sequence, while controlling for position (Position 4 only used) and zoo.</s><s>E, Item expectation effects were established by comparing activity patterns between the blank period (catch trial) and the item that was expected given the sequence context (red arrow), against activity patterns for different blank and seen items (gray arrows).</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,44.67,63.27,495.60,265.44" type="bitmap" /></figure>
