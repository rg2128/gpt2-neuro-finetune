<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral paradigms</head><p><s>Following recovery, rats were put on a mild water restriction regimen (45 min of free access to water each day) 1 week before the beginning of training.</s><s>Animals were progressively habituated to receive fluids via an IOC, to calmly sit while restrained, and to freely press the lever for water (40 l).</s><s>Session durations and intertrial intervals (ITIs) were progressively increased to 60 -90 min and to 35 Ϯ 5 s, respectively, over the first 10 -15 d of training.</s><s>Animals were then trained that the ITI terminated with the onset of a 3 s tone (4.5 kHz, 80 dB) and were required to press the lever during the 3 s cue period to receive water.</s><s>Pressing during the cue period terminated the tone and led to water delivery.</s><s>Both lever press with water delivery and failure to press within the cue period initiated the beginning of a new trial.</s><s>Early presses or presses within the ITI period were discouraged by increasing the ITI by 2 s.</s><s>Sessions typically lasted ϳ60 -90 min and were terminated at signs of disengagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fontanini and Katz, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Once rats achieved minimal pressing during the ITI (0 -2 presses/trial), a response percentage of Ͼ90%, and an ITI of 35 Ϯ 5 s; animals began training on the two-tone, go/no-go paradigm.</s><s>Between 4 and 6 weeks of training and shaping were normally required to reach this stage.</s></p><p><s>Two-tone, go/no-go paradigm.</s><s>In this paradigm, rats learned to lever press for a rewarding stimuli, Suc (0.1 M), and to withhold from pressing for an aversive stimulus, Q (5-10 mM during training, 10 mM following training).</s><s>High concentrations of Q were required to achieve optimal no-go behavior.</s><s>The switch in the concentration of Q from 5 to 10 mM was motivated by the observation that over the first days of go/no-go training, some rats tended to habituate to 5 mM and began to perform less consistently in no-go trials.</s><s>To ensure consistent and robust performance, rats were switched to 10 mM in the last stages of training before experimental sessions (well trained go/no-go sessions).</s><s>Each taste was paired with one of two pure tones (typically, 2 and 10 kHz counterbalanced across animals; 80 dB), so that one tone indicated the availability of Suc solution and the other of Q solution.</s><s>Auditory cues began with the termination of the ITI (35 Ϯ 5 s) and lasted for a maximum of 3 s.</s><s>Lever presses within the cue period immediately resulted in the delivery of the cue-associated tastes and the termination of the cue.</s><s>Both taste deliveries and failure to press within the cue period initiated the beginning of a new trial.</s><s>Trial types, Suc or Q, were chosen pseudorandomly with a 1:1 ratio.</s><s>Animals were trained on this task until they showed learning of the two cues (i.e., 80% correct performance).</s><s>Correct performance was defined as lever pressing to the sucrose-associated cue (Suc_cue) and withholding of pressing to the quinine-associated cue (Q_cue).</s><s>Correct performance was measured using a 10 trial moving window.</s><s>Animals typically learned the task within one to five sessions, each lasting between ϳ60 and 90 min.</s><s>Sessions were terminated when the animal stopped pressing over 10 consecutive trials and showed signs of disengagement.</s><s>The ability to remain task oriented appeared to be longer than in an uncued selfadministration task previously published <ref type="bibr">(Fontanini and</ref><ref type="bibr">Katz, 2005, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The difference is likely related to the use of salient cues and highly rewarding Suc in the present task.</s><s>Testing sessions involved the addition of a water rinse (50 l) delivered 10 s following taste deliveries (40 l).</s></p><p><s>Unexpected sucrose sessions.</s><s>Unexpected Suc sessions were go/no-go sessions in which Suc was unexpectedly delivered through the IOC at random trials and intervals during the ITI period.</s><s>These deliveries were identical to those elicited by lever press, differing only by the lack of cue and lever press.</s><s>Deliveries were triggered by the experimenter to prevent delivery overlap with aberrant lever-press movements or grooming behaviors.</s><s>Suc deliveries were followed by a water rinse (50 l) delivered 10 s later.</s><s>No taste, passive or self-delivered, occurred within 15 s of the prior rinse.</s><s>The ITI during trials with passive deliveries was increased by 25 s, including the 10 s rinse delay.</s><s>Typically, 8 -12 deliveries of Suc were delivered during a session.</s><s>Unexpected deliveries were performed only after the animal had reached the 80% correct performance level.</s></p><p><s>Omission sessions.</s><s>Omission sessions were go/no-go session in which 20% of the Suc_cue trials did not lead to Suc delivery following the lever press.</s><s>Instead, in these trials a lever press during the cue period stopped the cue, no tastant was delivered, and a rinse was delivered after 10 s.</s><s>The rinse was delivered so that omission trials differed only in the lack of Suc delivery.</s><s>These trials were given only after the animal had reached the 80% correct percentage criterion.</s></p><p><s>Extinction sessions.</s><s>Partial extinction sessions were performed to determine whether cue-responsive neurons tracked the cue-outcome association.</s><s>Partial extinction was preferred over reversal due to its feasibility within a single session; in preliminary experiments, reversal required long, multiday training to be achieved.</s><s>Extinction sessions began as regular go/no-go sessions.</s><s>Once animals had completed 30 trials after reaching the 80% correct criterion, extinction of the cue-taste pairing began.</s><s>During extinction trials, a lever press occurring in the cue period ended the current trial with no taste and rinse delivery.</s><s>The percentage of pressing to Suc_cue was assessed over 10 prior trials; when the animal pressed for Յ40% of the Suc_cue trials, the animal was considered to have partially extinguished the conditioned response behavior.</s><s>The session terminated when animals withheld from pressing in at least 15 Suc trials.</s></p><p><s>Classical conditioning sessions.</s><s>As a control for the effects of lever pressing, two rats were trained to associate auditory tones with tastants (Suc and Q) in a pavlovian task.</s><s>Rats underwent the same water restriction regimen and habituation to IOC fluid deliveries as animals in the operant task.</s><s>Animals were then trained to calmly receive water (40 l) while head restrained.</s><s>Session duration and ITI were progressively increased to 1 h and to 35 Ϯ 20 s, respectively, over the first 10 -15 d of training.</s><s>Animals were then habituated for one session to receive 40 l of Suc (0.1 M) and Q (1 mM), followed by a 50 l rinse (10 s after).</s><s>Following this day of taste habituation, rats were trained for 10 d to associate one auditory cue with Suc and another with Q deliveries.</s><s>Trials consisted of a 35 Ϯ 20 s ITI followed by a 2 s tone with taste deliveries occurring 1 s following the offset of the tone.</s><s>Auditory cues (rat 1: Suc_cue, 11.0 kHz pure tone; Q_cue, 2.5-9.0 kHz bandpass-filtered Gaussian noise; rat 2: Suc_cue, 0.5 kHz pure tone; Q_cue, 2.5 kHz amplitude-modulated sawtooth at 100 Hz; all tones were delivered at 80 dB) were kept consistent throughout training and testing.</s><s>Learning was assessed by monitoring the emergence of differential conditioned responses to the two cues.</s><s>Conditioned responses consisted of mouth movements, which were assessed and quantified by EMG recordings of jaw-opening muscles.</s><s>Only recordings from sessions in which learning was demonstrated were used for analysis.</s></p><p><s>Taste deliveries.</s><s>Tastes were delivered through the IOCs in 40 l aliquots (delivery time of 40 ms) by a pressurized taste delivery system (20 psi) operating with computer-controlled solenoid valves.</s><s>A 50 l rinse of water followed the taste 10 s after to wash the tongue and palate.</s><s>The Suc and Q concentrations used during testing were 0.1 M and 10 mM, respectively.</s><s>Although several sessions were analyzed in which Q was delivered at 5 mM [i.e., initial go/no-go training sessions; sessions using 5 mM were balanced across conditions on the first day on which animals were trained on the go/no-go task, yet did not reach the criterion (no_learn) and those on the first day on which animals reached the criterion (first_learn)], only cue responses were analyzed within these sessions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrophysiological and video recordings</head><p><s>During each recording session activity was recorded from movable bundles positioned in GC (either unilaterally or bilaterally).</s><s>Upon the termination of a set of different sessions [which could involve the following: well trained go/no-go, no_learn, first_learn, partial_ext, "unexpected sucrose," and omission sessions] electrodes were advanced a minimum of 80 m to record new ensembles.</s><s>The average number of units recorded per rat in the go/no-go experiment was 33.3 Ϯ 6.9 (n ϭ 29).</s><s>The average number of units recorded per rat in the classical conditioning experiment was 54.5 (n ϭ 2).</s><s>Neural signals were simultaneously amplified (gain of 4000 -16,000) then separately bandpass filtered [at 300 -8000 Hz for single units and 0.7-300 Hz for local field potentials (LFP)], digitized, and recorded (sampling rate: 40 kHz for single-unit waveforms, 1 kHz for LFP; Multichannel Acquisition Processor, Plexon).</s><s>Unique single-unit waveforms with at least a 3:1 signal-to-noise ratio were isolated on-line using voltage threshold detection and a template algorithm.</s><s>Units were further sorted off-line using cluster-cutting techniques and examination of interspike interval plots (Offline Sorter, Plexon).</s><s>Orofacial reactions to tastants and tones were video recorded (30 frames/s) with videos synchronized to the electrophysiological recordings (Cineplex, Plexon).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of electrophysiological data</head><p><s>Spike sorting and data analysis were performed using Offline Sorter (Plexon), Neuroexplorer (Nex Technologies), and custom-written scripts in MATLAB (MathWorks).</s><s>To compare neural activity with behavioral events, time stamps of single-unit spiking activity were aligned with stimuli of interest in the task.</s><s>Perievent rasters of individual units were used to generate peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs).</s><s>Unless otherwise stated, nonparametric tests were used for statistical comparisons due to their robustness and to avoid the assumption that data were normally distributed.</s><s>Indeed, normality tests often revealed that data were not normally distributed (at least for the bin widths used).</s></p><p><s>Population PSTHs and auROC normalization.</s><s>For neural population analyses and plots, PSTHs were normalized using the nonparametric, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cohen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chubykin et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This method normalizes stimulus-related activity to baseline activity on a 0 -1 scale in which 0.5 represents a median equivalence to baseline firing rate.</s><s>auROC normalization results in values ranging from 0 to 1, with a value of 0.5 corresponding to baseline, and values Ͼ0.5 or Ͻ0.5, respectively, being excitatory or inhibitory responses.</s><s>auROC values are based on the probability that values within a given bin are higher or lower than baseline activity.</s><s>A value of 1 indicates that all values within the bin of interest are higher than all values within the baseline window, whereas a value of 0 indicates all values within the bin are less than all values within the baseline window.</s><s>Population PSTHs (popPSTHs) were created by averaging the auROC normalized firing rate of all neurons within a subpopulation with error bars representing the mean SE at each bin.</s><s>The difference in firing rates evoked by Suc_cue and Q_cue (i.e., ⌬PSTH) was determined by averaging the absolute difference in cue-evoked activity, across the cues, for each cue-responsive unit and subtracting baseline difference.</s></p><p><s>Cue responsiveness.</s><s>PSTHs for single units were aligned to the onset of either the Suc_cue or Q_cue.</s><s>Cue-evoked responses were assessed for 250 ms following the onset of the cue over bins of 50 ms.</s><s>The choice of a 250 ms window for analysis of cue responses was based on a quantification of the latency of lever pressing.</s><s>Since rats were free to press at any time after the cue (within a 3 s window), reaction times varied from trial to trial.</s><s>The average latency of all lever presses was 696 Ϯ 4 ms, the average latency of the fastest press for each session was 330 Ϯ 8 ms.</s><s>Using a 250 ms window resulted in the removal of only 1.6% (n ϭ 188 of 11,454 total trials) of the trials (which had lever pressing earlier than 250 ms).</s><s>Analysis of the distribution of lever presses revealed that use of larger window widths would have led to removal of a substantially larger number of trials (i.e., 5.9% for 300 ms, 12.2% for 350 ms, and 38.5% for 500 ms).</s><s>In addition, extending the window to longer intervals would have led to the systematic inclusion of mouth movements (whose average onset in the case of Suc was 348.6 Ϯ 19.1 ms), which would have represented a potential confound.</s><s>Finally, a 250-ms-wide window was consistent with prior investigations of cue responses in a self-administration task published by our group <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Samuelsen et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Each bin following cue onset was compared with 1 s of baseline using an unbalanced Wilcoxon rank-sum test ( p Ͻ 0.05) with correction for familywise error accomplished by requiring either one bin to pass with a Sidak ␣ correction or two consecutive bins to pass with p Ͻ 0.05.</s><s>Units with a significant increase in activity following the cue were deemed excitatory cue responsive, whereas neurons with a significant decrease in activity were deemed inhibitory cue responsive.</s><s>Only correct postcriterion trials were used in this analysis, and a minimum of six trials were required for inclusion of a unit.</s><s>Cue-responsive units were split into the following four groups based on their responsiveness to the two cues: exclusively Suc_cue responsive, exclusively Q_cue responsive, responsive to both but significantly different, responsive to both and not significantly different.</s><s>Significant difference between cue responses was assessed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test ( p Ͻ 0.05) comparing bin-to-bin activity of the two cues.</s><s>Correction for familywise error was accomplished by requiring either one bin to pass with a Sidak ␣ correction or two consecutive bins to pass with p Ͻ 0.05.</s><s>Peak responsiveness for each neuron was determined as the maximum evoked normalized firing rate (auROC) across the five 50 ms bins.</s></p><p><s>Comparison of lever press-evoked activity.</s><s>To determine whether cueevoked activity was due to the motor act of pressing the lever, responses to lever presses that occurred after the cue onset were compared with responses to lever presses that occurred during the ITI.</s><s>Rats largely pressed only once following the cue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>To match this condition, only ITI lever presses that occurred in isolation (i.e., that were not preceded or followed by a press for a 1 s interval) were considered for this analysis.</s><s>A minimum of eight lever presses in each condition was required for the analysis to achieve statistical power.</s><s>One hundred thirtyseven of the 158 Suc_cue-responsive neurons came from sessions that met these criteria.</s><s>The normalized firing rate of the 50 ms before lever presses was compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</s></p><p><s>Learning session analyses.</s><s>Analysis of learning sessions was split into the following two conditions: no_learn sessions (12 animals, 12 sessions); and first_learn sessions (18 rats, 18 sessions).</s><s>Six of the 29 rats either took Ͼ3 d to learn the task or were removed from the analysis due to experimenter intervention during the task or lack of recordings.</s><s>In 5 of the 23 sessions, animals demonstrated a biased behavior toward one of the cues in the first quarter of the session and were removed from the analysis (Ͼ60% correct responding).</s><s>This was done to avoid inflating any biases toward either of the cues in the analysis and provide a conservative estimate of cue selectivity.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of cue responses was the same for both conditions.</s><s>Cue responsiveness was computed using all trials in the session; only those trials with lever presses earlier than 250 ms were removed.</s><s>The distributions of cue-responsive neurons in different sessions were compared using a 2 ϫ 4 Fisher's exact test.</s><s>The population ⌬PSTHs between cue responses were computed across all cue-responsive neurons for the entire session for each condition.</s><s>The significance of ⌬PSTHs and the differences in ⌬PSTHs for the various sessions were assessed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</s><s>To analyze the within-session time course of learning and cue responsiveness, sessions were split into four epochs, each consisting of 25% of the trials.</s><s>The correct response percentage was computed for each quarter of individual sessions and averaged across all sessions for each of the conditions.</s><s>The number of cue-responsive neurons that differentiated between the cues was assessed in each of these quarters.</s><s>The significant differences between cue responses were assessed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test ( p Ͻ 0.05) comparing the binto-bin activity of the two cues.</s><s>Correction for familywise error was accomplished by requiring either one bin to pass with a Sidak ␣ correction or two consecutive bins to pass with p Ͻ 0.05.</s><s>A one-sided McNemar test was used to determine whether the number of differentiating neurons increased between the first and last quarter of the sessions.</s><s>A Fisher's exact
