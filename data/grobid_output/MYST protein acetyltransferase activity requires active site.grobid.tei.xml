demonstrated in this study, we are able to deacetylate yEsa1 with the yHst2 deacetylase in vitro, although not to completion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Clearly, the potential regulatory role of MYST protein acetylation/deacetylation requires further study.</s></p><p><s>As in the MYST proteins, lysine autoacetylation also occurs within the HAT domain of the

autoacetylation in the three HAT families show significant differences.</s><s>While a single lysine residue within Rtt109 (K290 in yeast Rtt109) is acetylated in a buried site, the lysine residue is located in a helical segment and is about 12 A ˚from the sulphur atom of Ac-CoA <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lin and Yuan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stavropoulos et al, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tang et al, 2008)</ref>, nearly twice the distance as the autoacetylated lysine in the MYST proteins.</s><s>In stark contrast, p300/CBP contains an B60 residue highly basic and proteolytically sensitive loop that harbours multiple lysine acetylation sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Thompson et al, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, the p300/CBP, Rtt109 and MYST family of HATs appear to be regulated by autoacetylation through distinct mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>The activities of protein kinases are modulated by multiple mechanisms, although nearly all share regulation by a 20-30 residue polypeptide segment located just outside of the active site cleft called the activation loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McInnes and Fischer, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>This segment typically contains one or more phosphorylation sites (either serine, threonine or tyrosine residues) that are modified by either the same kinase or a different kinase.</s><s>In the unphosphorylated form, the activation loop takes on an autoinhibitory conformation; while in the phosphorylated form, the activation loop adopts a conformation that facilitates either substrate binding, catalysis or both.</s><s>Like the kinases, it appears that at least three families of HAT enzymes have elevated catalytic activities when they are posttranslationally modified at one or more residues.</s><s>Indeed, stimulation of kinase activity and substrate binding by activation loop phosphorylation in kinases appears analogous to stimulation of acetylation activity and substrate binding by a2-b7 loop acetylation in MYST protein acetyltransferases.</s><s>However, unlike the kinases, other HAT families, like p300/CBP and Rtt109 appear to be regulated by posttranslational modification through more diverse mechanisms, as described above.</s><s>Taken together, the studies reported here point to an additional layer of acetyltransferase regulation by posttranslational modifications that might place them on the same playing field as protein kinases as key regulatory nodes in various signal transduction pathways.</s></p></div>
