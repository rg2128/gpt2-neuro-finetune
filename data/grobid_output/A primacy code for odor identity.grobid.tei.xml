<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scaling of integration time with odorant concentration.</head><p><s>Changes in odorant concentration should change the absolute timing of OSN recruitment and, thus, affect the timing of odor percept formation in our task.</s><s>We tested this prediction by fitting a Weibull generalized linear model (see "Methods" section) to masking data for two concentrations of odorant and comparing the thresholds of these fits.</s><s>A 10-fold decrease in concentration delays the recovery of performance in masking trials by 13.3 ms (100.3 vs. 87.0</s><s>ms, bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals [94.2, 105.9] and (81.8, 91.5), p = 0.048 (one-tailed Monte Carlo test, R = 50,000).</s><s>As expected, odor percepts are formed later for lower odorant concentrations, likely due to delayed recruitment of OSN activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Very similar dependencies have been observed for other odor pairs and 5 other mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Reaction time (RT) has been used extensively to determine the timing of sensory processing and decision-making based on sensory stimuli.</s><s>The dependence of performance on both mask latency and RT are qualitatively similar, except that the reaction time curve is shifted by ~66 ms.</s><s>This relationship is similar for both concentrations tested here (65.5 and 66.2 ms, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">Insert</ref>).</s><s>The concentration-dependent shift in RT vs. performance can be wholly explained by the shift observed in our masking paradigm, indicating that peripheral encoding of odor information limits the timing of olfactory decision making.</s><s>The observed delay between the RT and mask can be ascribed to a motor delay that is constant across concentrations.</s><s>Mask trials may promote the use of a novel strategy to utilize early information.</s><s>To address this issue, we performed two analyses.</s><s>First, we compared reaction time in unmasked trials and trials where the mask was presented late (t ≥ 100 ms) and had minimal effect on performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1G</ref>).</s><s>The Weibull fits to the dependencies of performance on reaction time in both cases are nearly identical.</s><s>Second, we see no effect of learning on mask trials between early and late behavioral sessions, comparing the performance on the first and last 20 masked trials across all sessions (Fisher-Exact test p &gt; 0.05).</s><s>(Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results provide evidence that randomly presented masking trials do not change the animal decision strategy and that animals typically use early evoked information in the odor discrimination tasks.</s></p><p><s>Scaling of integration time with odor contrast.</s><s>Does primacy coding strategy apply only to simple tasks?</s><s>To make the behavioral task more difficult, we trained animals to discriminate between mixtures of carvone enantiomers (60:40 vs. 40:60).</s><s>Using mixtures to reduce the contrast between stimuli decreases discrimination performance relative to pure carvones (83.3 vs. 90.8%)</s><s>and delays the mask threshold time (118 ms vs. 101 ms) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>As with the latency shift between concentrations of odorant, the shift due to decreased contrast is consistent with the measure of reaction time vs. performance (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1H</ref>).</s><s>To generate an equivalent level of performance in the more difficult mixture discrimination task, sensory information must be integrated by the subject over a longer period of time.</s><s>However, the extension in integration time is relatively small on the scale of the length of a sniff, demonstrating that animals are still using early information to make this more difficult discrimination.</s></p><p><s>Neural correlates of concentration-invariant primacy code.</s><s>Our behavioral results define the temporal window in which odor information is integrated.</s><s>To determine if primacy codes exist in the OB at timescales consistent with our behavior, we recorded responses of 338 MT cells to 3 odorant concentrations spanning a range of 2 order of magnitude.</s><s>The primacy coding model predicts the existence of MT neurons that display excitatory responses to odor across a wide range of concentrations in a narrow temporal window at the beginning of the sniff.</s><s>Among 119 units which exhibit excitatory responses to odorant α-pinene, 15 responded to all three concentrations, a subset that we called "concentration-stable" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>The remaining 104 units responded only to subset of concentrations, which we called "concentration-unstable" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>As expected, a number of responsive units grew as concentration increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>While the population response at low concentration was dominated by concentration-stable units, unstable units were 3.7 times more numerous at the highest concentration tested.</s><s>According to our primacy coding model, the identity of early, stable units that are responsive across concentrations represent odor identity.</s><s>The stable population's mean response latency was shorter than the unstable population at all concentrations (conc 10 -3 : 86.8 ms vs. 177.2</s><s>ms, p = 0.0003; conc 10 -2 : 82.7 ms vs. 148.2</s><s>ms, p = 0.0071; and conc 10 -1 : 85.7 ms vs. 149.0</s><s>ms, p = 0.0249; one-sided KS test).</s><s>While the latencies of the unstable and stable populations overlapped, a subset of stable units responded earlier than all unstable units at the highest concentration, which is consistent with the primacy coding model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>The latencies of these stable units scaled with concentration, as predicted by the model and behavioral result.</s><s>The mean latency shift between concentrations for this early, concentration-stable subset was 15.5 ms, (σ: 5.5 ms).</s><s>This is comparable to the timing shifts in behavioral identification across concentration (13.3 ms).</s><s>The stable population's activity encoded odor-identity information and was not representative of non-specific odor responses; only one of these concentration-stable units was responsive to another odorant tested, α-limonene.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, we find that latencies and even latency relationships are not preserved across concentrations in awake animals, although this has been observed in anesthetized animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Instead, both absolute and relative latencies of stable units' responses shift dramatically as concentration increases, clustering into early and late subsets at the highest concentrations.</s><s>We observed that the excitatory responses of the late set of stable cells was preceded by transient inhibition at high concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a lower panel,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>).</s><s>This transient odor-evoked inhibition was observed widely in our recorded population (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F,</ref><ref type="figure">H</ref>), and we hypothesize that it is due to lateral and feedback inhibition in the OB.</s><s>For late stable units, we predict that earlier members of the MT population drive inhibition arriving earlier than or in coincidence with feedforward excitation.</s><s>This shunts the neuron's initial excitatory response, causing an apparent increase in response latency.</s><s>As a result, we conclude that these units are not in the primary set, as it is obvious that earlier members of the population must precede them to generate the network activity responsible for this inhibition.</s><s>So, while short latency is predictive of concentration-invariance, the relationships of response latencies within our recorded population as a whole are not conserved across concentrations and are unlikely to encode odor identity.</s><s>Read out of primacy code by a model neural network.</s><s>What elements of olfactory networks are sufficient to process primacy information?</s><s>How does mask affect odor recognition?</s><s>Our behavioral data show an incomplete suppression of animal performance at small masking delays (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>In a more difficult discrimination task, the effect of mask is slightly delayed compared to easier tasks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>Are these features expected within the primacy coding mechanism?</s><s>To address these questions, we developed a computational primacy decoding model based on known features of the OB and piriform cortical (PC) circuits.</s><s>First, our model includes random feedforward connectivity between the OB and PC which provides the basis for coincidence detection of MT cell activity arriving early in the sniff cycle.</s><s>Second, our model includes random recurrent inhibitory circuits in the PC (blue in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>The role of this connectivity is to suppress late arriving, "non-primary" input to PC neurons.</s><s>This architecture is consistent with observed global and broadly tuned inhibition in the PC <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and has been used as a feature of network models for the processing of fine temporal information in the PC, including the proposed mechanism for coincidence detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Finally, we assumed that PC neurons have a memory property such that once activated, they can maintain the persistent activity in order to retain the odorant representation in the network until the initiation of action.</s><s>Although our computational model does not explicitly specify the mechanism of persistency, it has been hypothesized to emerge from voltage dependent synaptic channels, such as NMDAR or GABA B activating KIR channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Overall, our network included randomly connected 300 MC and 1000 PC neurons.</s></p><p><s>Our model provides insights into the mechanism of optogenetic suppression of the animal's performance for early delivered masks.</s><s>We simulated odor-evoked activity in MT cells as a random spatiotemporal pattern and the mask as synchronous activity independent of odor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>When the mask follows initial odor-evoked activity, it does not affect odorant-dependent activity patterns in PC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>), due to the broad inhibitory network, which suppresses excitatory inputs from the late mask or odorant-dependent inputs.</s><s>In contrast, when the mask precedes odor activation, a pattern of activity emerging in the PC is not odorant-dependent and is different from those of the odorants alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>This light-evoked pattern can be viewed as a new percept that is unrelated to the original odors.</s></p><p><s>Our model qualitatively explains an incomplete suppression of discrimination for early masks (t &lt; 0.2) (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>, black and gray lines).</s><s>This occurs due to the presence of noise: on certain trials, odor-dependent OB responses are more robust than on average, causing failure of the mask on these trials (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>In case of complex mixture, the behavioral response is delayed compared to an easy stimulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>, blue vs. black lines), which is consistent with experimental results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>This occurs because the differences in pools of primary glomeruli emerge slightly later in the sniff cycle, as both of the stimuli have similar sets of initially activated glomeruli.</s><s>This result implies that primacy read out mechanism does not take the sequence of glomerular activation into account, since such differences are expected to occur early.</s><s>In a version of the model sensitive to the
