(2009)</ref> imply that neutral faces were a category as well?</s><s>Evidence against this interpretation was found in PE.</s><s>Accuracy dropped for morphs with low contributions of the emotional expression (particularly 10% and 20%), because participants could no longer identify the emotion that was displayed.</s></p><p><s>When the latencies of the correct responses were weighted by the proportion of correct responses, that is to say when IES was calculated, another picture emerged.</s><s>The IES-curve kept rising up to the 10% condition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), in line with a Signal Detection view saying that the neutral expression consisted of noise against which the emotional signal was perceived.</s><s>Given that the latter is a better description of what was going on in the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rossignol et al. (2009)</ref>, the IES curve provides us with a more accurate picture of the data than the RT curve.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IES is not always better than RT</head><p><s>Unfortunately, further analysis indicated that the situation is not always as clear-cut as in the example above.</s><s>Take, for example, a study published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Goffaux et al. (2005)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, participants were shown triads of faces: a target face at the top of a triangle, and two comparison faces at the bottom angles.</s><s>The comparison faces consisted of the target and a distractor.</s><s>All faces were filtered so that only low spatial frequencies (LFS), only high spatial frequencies (HSF), or the full spectrum of spatial frequencies (Full) were displayed.</s><s>In addition, the distractor face could differ locally (i.e., had differ-ent features), globally (had a different overall shape), or both locally and globally.</s><s>Participants had to indicate which comparison face matched the target face.</s><s>A 3x3 (filter * type of distractor) ANOVA was computed.</s><s>The main effect of distractor was significant for both RT and IES.</s><s>However, for RT, this was due to an advantage of the conditions local and local + global, which did not differ from each other, over the condition global, whereas for IES all pairwise comparisons were significant.</s><s>Thus, a new effect emerged after the IES transformation.</s><s>The interaction between spatial filter and type of distractor was significant both for RT and IES, but had a different shape.</s><s>When global distractors were used, the analysis of RTs revealed an advantage of HFS and Full (which did not differ from each other) over LSF.</s><s>However, with the IES measure there was no significant difference between the three conditions.</s><s>Thus, an effect observed with RT disappeared after the IES transformation.</s></p><p><s>We ran similar analyses of other studies we had access to.</s><s>Four patterns emerged: (a) no change after transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Campanella, Bruyer, Froidbise, Rossignol, Joassin, Kornreich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Christie &amp; Klein, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jacques &amp; Rossion, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kennett et al., 2001)</ref> RT IES apparition of significant effects in the same study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bruyer, Leclère, &amp; Quinet, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Constant, Lancereau, Gillain, Delatte, Ferauge, &amp; Bruyer, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Goffaux et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Joassin, Maurage, Campanella, &amp; Bruyer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rossignol et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>So, it is not the case that IES always clarifies matters.</s><s>It looks pretty much like every type of change is possible with the introduction of IES.</s></p><p><s>The reason why IES has no straightforward relationship with RT is that it combines two variables subject to sampling error.</s><s>This increases the variability of the measure.</s><s>In addition, it is not clear whether the division of RT by PC is always a good reflection of the relative weights of speed and accuracy.</s><s>To examine these weaknesses, we made use of an effect that is well documented and for which there are many data available.</s><s>One of the best established effects in cognitive psychology is the word frequency effect in lexical decision: participants decide much better that a letter string is a word rather than a nonword when the letters make a high-frequency word than when they make a low-frequency word.</s><s>In addition, there are now lexical decision times for thousands of words, making it possible to get a clear image of the word frequency effect across the entire range.</s><s>For instance, in the so-called French Lexicon Project, Ferrand, New, Brysbaert, Keuleers, Bonin, Méot et al. ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>) assessed lexical decisions for 38,335 French words, which were seen by 25 participants each (the entire study involved 975 participants).</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the RTs and PCs as a function of log10 word frequency per million (pm; so 0 = a frequency of 1 pm, 1 = a frequency of 10 pm, 2 = a frequency of 100 pm, and -1 = a frequency of .1 pm).</s><s>Both RT and PC show a clear relationship with word frequency: RTs are about 200 ms slower for words with a frequency below .1 pm than for words with a frequency above</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3</head><p><s>The word frequency effect in the French Lexicon Project for IES.</s><s>Bars indicate the 95% confidence interval rather unstable.</s><s>The second problem is that some of these "correct" responses are probably the result of guesses or even "mistakes" (e.g., the participant wanted to indicate that the low-frequency word was not a word, but pressed the wrong button).</s><s>Finally, the multiplication of RT due to PC is not linear, but accelerates the lower PC becomes (e.g., RT is multiplied by 1 when PC = 1.0, by 1.1 when PC = .90,</s><s>but by 1.4 when PC = .70</s><s>and by 1.7 when PC = .60).</s><s>In all likelihood, the multiplication weight of accuracy becomes too high for low PC-values.</s><s>This is particularly a problem in situations where the lower limit of correct guessing is low, for instance in the experiment of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rossignol et al. (2009)</ref> where six different expressions were used.</s><s>Although in a lexical word/non-word decision experiment, it can be defended that no PCs under .60 are meaningful (otherwise the participant is simply guessing or does not know the word), in an experiment with 6 response alternatives meaningful PCs can go as low as 1/6 = .17,</s><s>meaning that for these accuracy levels RTs can be multiplied by up to 6. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Townsend and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ashby (1978, 1983)</ref> warned that the IES only works when there is a positive correlation between RT and PE: the IES transformation should be used only if high and linear correlations are evidenced.</s><s>So, Townsend and Ashby advise not to use IES in cases of speed-accuracy trade-off.</s><s>A preliminary check to make sure that RT and PE are positively correlated was done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akhtar and Enns (1989)</ref>, but seems to be absent in many other studies.</s><s>Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Christie and Klein (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Goffaux et al. (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jacques and Rossion (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kennett et al. (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kuefner et al. (2010)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Murphy and Klein (1998)</ref> simply reported the usual separate analyses of accuracy, correct latencies, and IES without any further information.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Minnebusch et al.

(2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Murphy and Klein (1998)</ref> mentioned the problem of the speed-accuracy trade-off, saying that some participants might show the effects of interest for speed and others for accuracy, but did not address the issue directly in their statistical analyses.</s><s>Furthermore, as our example of the French Lexicon Project shows, a positive correlation between RT and PE does not guarantee that more variance will be explained in the IES measures than in the RT measure (the correlation between RT and PE in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ferrand et al. (2010)</ref> is r[38333] = 0.56, p &lt; 0.001).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Although we set out with high hopes that the IES measure could be a better and a more concise variable than RT and PE to convey the findings of a cognitive psychology experiment, our analyses have shown that the "blind" use of IES as DV is likely to lead to interpretation problems.</s><s>The main issue is that IES increases the variability of the data.</s><s>This became very clear in the statis-tical analysis of the data from the French Lexicon Project: although the frequency effect on average seemed clearer for IES than for RT (Figures <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>), the percentage of variance explained in IES by word frequency was less than half of the variance explained in RT.</s><s>This remained the case even when the words were limited to those with PC &gt; .66.</s><s>Only for the words with PC &gt; .90 was the amount of variance explained in IES and RT the same.</s><s>Further analyses will have to indicate whether some other combination of RT and PC [e.g., log (IES)] is a better measure.</s></p><p><s>The increase in variability will be particularly problematic in studies with small numbers of observations per condition (as is mostly the case in cognitive psychology).</s><s>If a condition only has 20 stimuli, then 2 errors already make a difference of .10 in PC.</s><s>Depending on where in the range this 10% falls, RT multiplications will range from 1.1 (from 1.00 to .90) to 2.0 (from .20 to .10).</s><s>For RTs around 600 ms, this means increases from 60 to 600 ms, which are considerably larger than the RT effects generally investigated in cognitive psychology (which tend to be in the order of 20-60 ms).</s><s>In general, an increase in the variance of the DV will diminish the power of the experiment.</s><s>Occasionally, however, it may result in a spurious effect, when by chance a few more mistakes are made in one condition than in the other.</s><s>This will lead to Type I errors (the illusion of having found a significant difference, whereas in reality there is none), which is particularly a problem if journals are more likely to publish "statistically significant" effects than null-effects.</s><s>In our experience, spurious effects are most likely in the interaction terms of multivariable experiments.</s></p><p><s>All in all, IES only seems to have value when the number of errors is small and when there is a high correlation between RT and PE, indicating that both variables are in unison.</s><s>Even then, it is presumably safer to calculate RT and PE as well, to make sure that IES is in line with them.</s><s>On the basis of our analyses, we have to conclude that it is not a good idea to limit the analyses to IES without any further checking of the data.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1The effect of the morphing manipulation of facial expression on correct latencies and IES.</s><s>The abscissa indicates the % of emotional expression in the morphs, and the ordinates indicate correct RT (left ordinate) and IES (right ordinate), both in ms.</s><s>Data from<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rossignol et al., 2009</ref></s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
