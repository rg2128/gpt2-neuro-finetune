to effect perceptual change by exposing observers in a structured fashion to the template photographs that were used to generate the two-tone images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref>,

alternatively, in the Incongruent control condition, the probes were presented in exactly the same location but their orientation was orthogonal to the invisible contour.</s><s>For the purpose of illustration, the edge element is shown in high contrast.</s><s>(c) Testing started with the choice of 20 two-tone images and the measurement of a preliminary threshold (Experiment 1 only).</s><s>Thresholds were then estimated in two Before blocks (max.</s><s>480 trials), in which observers saw probe stimuli embedded in two-tone images.</s><s>Subsequently, observers were exposed to the template images in two blocks.</s><s>Finally, thresholds were measured again in two After blocks (max 480 trials), in which observers saw exactly the same stimuli as in the Before blocks.</s><s>(d) The top panel shows the interval structure of a single trial.</s><s>After presentation of the two-tone image and a fixation square, which indicated the location and possible orientation of the edge probe, a small grey patch appeared on the two-tone image.</s><s>Every trial consisted of two such intervals: In Experiment 1, the grey patch in one interval contained a faint edge, the other did not (lower panel).</s><s>Within each trial, observers were asked to indicate which of the two intervals contained the edge element.</s><s>In Experiment 2, the grey patch of both intervals contained high contrast edge elements but these differed slightly in orientation (lower panel).</s><s>The task for the participants was to indicate which interval contained the more clockwise oriented edge element.</s><s>Contrast and orientation difference were adjusted across trials to allow estimating the observers' threshold in detecting an edge (Experiment 1) and discriminating between orientations of two edges (Experiment 2).</s><s>In both experiments, edge elements were shown along the invisible contour (Along condition) or, in a control condition, orthogonal to the contour (Orthogonal condition).</s><s>(e) Illustration of the tasks used to familiarise observers with the templates.</s><s>Between the Before and the After blocks, during which thresholds for edge detection and discrimination were measured, observers participated in two tasks to provide them with prior object knowledge.</s><s>First, in an active search paradigm (left panel), they viewed each template image individually and were asked to respond to the appearance of a dot by clicking on it with a cursor.</s><s>The dot did not appear with an abrupt onset but was very slowly ramped up in luminance, forcing observers to constantly scan the image and, thus, actively pick up information from it.</s><s>In a second, passive viewing task (right panel), observers were shown a gradual blend from template image to two-tone image and back again.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows the results from our first experiment.</s><s>Contrast sensitivity of early feature-detectors was modulated by high-level representations.</s><s>Exposing observers to object knowledge (After session), improved their sensitivity to the presence of edge probes that were aligned with an invisible contour (Congruent condition) compared to when the same two-tone images were perceived as meaningless black-and-white patches (Before session) (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>; example observer).</s><s>We contrasted the proportional change in absolute contrast detection-threshold from Before to After sessions across conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>).</s><s>This change in sensitivity was significantly larger in the Congruent test than the Incongruent control condition (t = 2.55, df = 11, P &lt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In summary, we report that high-level object perception can improve sensitivity to the contrast and orientation of an edge probe embedded in an image.</s><s>Specifically when a (task-irrelevant) two-tone image is perceived as an object, and contains an edge that is coherent with this high-level representation, then observers are better at detecting and judging the orientation of such edges compared to when the image is perceived as a series of meaningless patches.</s><s>This improvement is observed despite the fact that sensory input remained identical across viewing situations and that spatial and feature-based attentional factors were controlled for by the experimental design.</s><s>Perception of edges that are incongruent with the object representation are not influenced.</s><s>The early feature-detectors that are targeted by our procedure respond largely to small, local patches of visual space and do not

processing but have measurable influences on human perception.</s><s>Second, suppression of information that is congruent with an observer's high-level representation might be important to increase efficiency of the neuronal code.</s><s>Importantly, however, our findings demonstrate that a sharpening of low-level features is the process most relevant for human visual behaviour.</s><s>This finding thus highlights that the two different components of predictive coding models -suppression and sharpening -relate differentially to the visual experience that ultimately guides human behaviour.</s></p><p><s>A long tradition of perception research has established that biological sensory systems, including the human visual system, are optimised through evolution and development to process the image regularities of natural scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> .</s><s>This optimisation determines response characteristics of feature detectors globally and generally, independently of whether they are currently relevant to processing a stimulus.</s><s>Our study extends this idea to a more fine-tuned mechanism that shapes the early visual system in a context-dependent way.</s><s>In natural viewing situations, objects are encountered in complex, cluttered environments and are often partially occluded.</s><s>In this context, appropriate interpretation and processing of low-level features belonging to the same object poses a complex problem.</s><s>The current study supports the idea that flexible guidance of local mechanisms by global, high-level object representations might help to overcome this challenge.</s><s>In fact, given that the early visual system is largely blind to global characteristics of a visual scene, a dynamic interaction between low-level and high-level vision as described here is one of the few ways in which the response properties of all information-processing units (including early feature-detectors) can be optimised for the current perceptual context.</s><s>Two-tone images are, of course, artificial stimuli that differ substantially from natural scenes.</s><s>Yet, several aspects of our findings suggest that the modulatory effects uncovered here might be a characteristic process of general object recognition in everyday visual behaviour.</s><s>For instance, it is noteworthy that top-down modulation of early feature-detectors emerged incidentally in this study: the two-tone images that provided the perceptual context for the edge probes were entirely task-irrelevant and observers were not instructed to focus on these images.</s><s>Rather, they had merely been exposed to the templates that clearly depicted the object content carried by the two-tone images.</s><s>Using naturalistic images, Neri <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> has shown that important aspects of perceptual organisation -contour and motion integration -are guided by high-level semantic processing.</s><s>However, unlike in our study where stimuli were identical and the modulatory context was task-irrelevant, Neri's experiments not only used different sensory inputs to induce the modulation but required observers to explicitly integrate target probes with a natural scene.</s><s>In other words, in contrast to the incidental nature of top-down modulation of early feature-detectors in our study, the modulation of the mid-level integration processes in the Neri studies relies on the task-relevance of the modulatory context.</s><s>Importantly, the task-independence of the effects in our study might be an indicator that top-down modulation of early feature-detectors is a characteristic process of general object recognition in everyday visual behaviour.</s><s>While the current results do not rule out the possibility that, under ideal viewing conditions, object recognition is largely driven by bottom-up processes, our findings are consistent with the notion that top-down modulation manifests in response to the ambiguity and uncertainty that is typical for natural scenes.</s></p><p><s>Once a two-tone image is disambiguated by the observer, contours and surfaces are experienced despite their physical absence in the stimulus.</s><s>"Illusory contours", such as those induced by, e.g., Kanizsa triangles <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> , might be a related visual phenomenon.</s><s>A change in detectability of lines superimposed onto an illusory contour has been found by some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> , but not all <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr"

processing is still an on-going debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> .</s><s>The explanatory difficulty arises because the global shape percept can only be manipulated by changing the stimulus properties.</s><s>It is thus unclear whether illusory contours in, e.g., Kanizsa triangles, emerge due to top-down modulation by object knowledge of triangles or by bottom-up processing induced by a specific stimulus configuration.</s><s>In fact, illusory contours are experienced only under specific stimulus configurations, and are found in a large range of animals, including some with comparatively simple brains, such as insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> .</s><s>Several authors have therefore argued that they result largely from neuronal wiring of mechanisms in early visual areas, which are triggered by specific stimulus configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> .</s><s>Such explanations do not apply to our findings.</s><s>Thus, even if the perception of two-tone images and illusory contours are related, the stimuli used in the current study are unique in that they allow induction of a global percept on the basis of prior knowledge without changing stimulus properties.</s><s>A similar point can be made regarding other context effects in visual processing.</s><s>For instance, the detectability of oriented elements is improved by a context of similarly oriented, co-axially positioned stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr"

top-down modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>Our results contrast with such effects and explanations.</s><s>The sensory context, within which the edge probes were embedded in our study, was identical between sessions and conditions.</s><s>This allows us to exclude interpretations of our results in terms of differences in stimulus-induced contextual modulation.</s></p><p><s>Spatial attention is by far the most studied top-down process in the visual system, and its mechanisms and effects are comparatively well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>For instance, attending to a certain part of visual space increases contrast sensitivity at that location <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> .</s><s>While this might appear superficially similar to the findings of our first experiment, here we can exclude differential deployment of spatial attention as an explanation for our findings.</s><s>A fixation square that was shown prior to the edge probe afforded observers equal opportunities to allocate attention to the location in which the edge probe appeared (across all conditions/sessions).</s><s>Moreover, probes appeared in identical spatial locations in Before and After sessions as well as Congruent and Incongruent conditions (differing only in orientation).</s><s>The experimental design of our study thus prevented differential deployment of spatial attention across the different conditions and sessions.</s><s>Spatial attention can therefore not account for the specific pattern of our results.</s></p><p><s>Does feature-based attention provide an explanation of our findings?</s><s>All forms of attention are typically conceptualised as a means of focussing limited processing

in which the edge elements could be shown.</s><s>In other words, observers knew exactly which two orientations were task-relevant in both experiments.</s><s>Moreover, they explicitly knew that two-tones images (and the high-level object representation they induced in the After session) were task-irrelevant.</s><s>This important aspect of our experimental design thus speaks against an explanation of our findings in terms of feature-based attention.</s><s>Yet, it could be argued that despite the fact that observers knew that the two-tone images were task-irrelevant, they nevertheless allocated more attentional resources to the feature that was consistent with the high-level representation when the two-tone image was experienced as a coherent percept (in the After sessions).</s><s>In other words, one could argue that when observers experienced the two-tone images as meaningless patches (in the Before sessions), allocation of feature-based attention was driven by the fixation square, and processing resources were equally distributed across both relevant orientations; for edge probes aligned with the invisible contour, however, resource allocation might have been increased when the two-tone image was experienced as a coherent percept and this could explain the performance benefit in this condition.</s><s>Importantly, however, attention is typically thought to be a limited resource mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76</ref> .</s><s>It is therefore difficult to understand how such an improvement at one orientation could be achieved without incurring a cost at the respective other orientation.</s><s>In fact, the feature-similarity gain model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> , one of the leading models of feature-based attention, argues that deployment of attention to a certain feature will increase the response of neurons with a tuning preference similar to that feature.</s><s>Critically, however, the model explicitly states that suppression of cells increases as their tuning preference deviates from the currently attended feature value.</s><s>This kind of suppression has been demonstrated both electrophysiologically <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> and psychophysically <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81</ref> for various feature dimensions, including orientation.</s><s>In the context of our study, this means that if observers deployed more attention to the orientation of the invisible contour, this should result in suppression of neurons tuned to the orthogonal orientation.</s><s>Consequently, a feature-based attention account of our study would predict increased performance in the test condition but decreased performance in the control condition, in which target probes were oriented orthogonally to the invisible contour.</s><s>This pattern of results was not found.</s></p><p><s>Top-down processing is sometimes equated with attention.</s><s>Developments of the last decades, however, have highlighted other factors that contribute to top-down modulation of

this effort by clearly specifying that information relating to early features and information relating to high-level objects show a bidirectional influence on each other.</s><s>Moreover, it is tempting to speculate that the process that mediates this interaction may not be a limited resources mechanism.</s><s>Rather, being able to generate a coherent percept of a two-tone image on the basis of prior object knowledge might provide the visual system with information about the stimulus that was not present when the two-tone image was experienced as meaningless patches.</s><s>By feeding this information to the earlier information-processing units, which by themselves do not have access to this high-level information, all levels of the system are optimised for the current perceptual context.</s><s>In other words, rather than distributing a limited and constant amount of processing resources across task-relevant and task-irrelevant aspects of the environment, the interaction between high-level object representations and early feature-detectors means that each part of the information-processing system, including early vision, might gain access to a larger amount of information.</s><s>Feature detectors are thus able to achieve higher performance without incurring a cost, an idea that is in line with current developments in theoretical neuroscience, and in particular with certain types of predictive coding models <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To conclude, the current study provides direct evidence from human visual behaviour that even early feature-detectors are shaped by high-level object representations.</s><s>Specifically, these top-down influences, which are separable from attentional modulation, optimise early information-processing mechanisms for the current perceptual context.</s><s>We suggest that this flexible optimisation of local mechanisms by high-level object representations provides important constraints for visual processing in the complex and cluttered environment that characterises natural viewing situations.</s><s>The finding of such context-dependent and local top-down processes

(a) The left panel shows the template image from which the two-tone image in the right panel was generated by binarising greyscale values around a threshold.</s><s>Red ovals in the right panel indicate two example locations that lack a contour in the two-tone image but contain a meaningful contour in the template image.</s><s>(b) Small edge elements were embedded in two-tone images at such locations (right panel).</s><s>Locations and orientations were identified by filtering the template image with a bank of orientation-tuned Gabor filters (left panel, orientation is colourcoded).For the purpose of illustration, the edge element is shown in high contrast.</s><s>(c) Testing started with the choice of 20 two-tone images and the measurement of a preliminary threshold (Experiment 1 only).</s><s>Thresholds were then estimated in two Before blocks (max.</s><s>480 trials), in which observers saw probe stimuli embedded in two-tone images.</s><s>Subsequently, observers were exposed to the template images in two blocks.</s><s>Finally, thresholds were measured again in two After blocks (max 480 trials), in which observers saw exactly the same stimuli as in the Before blocks.</s><s>(d) The top panel shows the interval structure of a single trial.</s><s>After presentation of the two-tone image and a fixation square, which indicated the location and possible orientation of the edge probe, a small grey patch appeared on the two-tone image.</s><s>Every trial consisted of two such intervals: In Experiment 1, the grey patch in one interval contained a faint edge, the other did not (lower panel).</s><s>Within each trial, observers were asked to indicate which of the two intervals contained the edge element.</s><s>In Experiment 2, the grey patch of both intervals contained high contrast edge elements but these differed slightly in orientation (lower panel).</s><s>The task for the participants was to indicate which interval contained the more clockwise oriented edge element.</s><s>Contrast and orientation difference were adjusted across trials to allow estimating the observers' threshold in detecting an edge (Experiment 1) and discriminating between orientations of two edges (Experiment 2).</s><s>In both experiments, edge elements were shown along the invisible contour (Along condition) or, in a control condition, orthogonal to the contour (Orthogonal condition).</s><s>(e) Illustration of the tasks used to familiarise observers with the templates.</s><s>Between the Before and the After blocks, during which thresholds for edge detection and discrimination were measured, observers participated in two tasks to provide them with prior object knowledge.</s><s>First, in an active search paradigm (left panel), they viewed each template image individually and were asked to respond to the appearance of a dot by clicking on it with a cursor.</s><s>The dot did not appear with an abrupt onset but was very slowly ramped up in luminance, forcing observers to constantly scan the image and, thus, actively pick up information from it.</s><s>In a second, passive viewing task (right panel), observers were shown a gradual blend from template image to two-tone image and back again.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,98.64,46.50,456.00,320.64" type="bitmap" /></figure>
