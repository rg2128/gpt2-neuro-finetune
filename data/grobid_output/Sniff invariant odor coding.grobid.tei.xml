<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Sensory systems must extract accurate representations of the outside world despite variability in sampling behavior.</s><s>We studied whether odor representation is invariant to changes in sampling frequency.</s><s>We found that behavioral performance in an odor concentration discrimination task does not depend on sniff frequency, suggesting that odor representations are indeed sniff frequency invariant.</s><s>To identify neural signatures of this invariance, we studied responses of MT cells to different odors and concentrations.</s><s>The amplitude and the latency of MT cells' responses varied systematically with sniff duration.</s><s>We proposed a FD model that explains this response variability and provides the best description of the odor responses.</s><s>Further, transforming odor responses based on the FD model makes the responses invariant to sniff wave form variability and allows much more accurate concentration discrimination.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations of proposed FD-based model</head><p><s>We propose a very simple FD model for odor propagation in the nose.</s><s>Although nasal cavities have complex geometries, the airflow within them is predominantly laminar and thus can be approximated using simple models <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zwicker et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Obviously, our simple model does not capture all the subtleties of odor propagation, however, it does provide a reasonable explanation for the observed variability in sniff waveforms which contribute to variability in MT cell odor responses.</s><s>Importantly, the FD model proposes that variability in the latency of MT cells activation is to flow dynamics in the nasal cavity.</s><s>Therefore, no top-down processes such as behavioral state or motor efference copy should affect alignment.</s><s>Moreover, we believe that the FD model will be equally valid for other species.</s><s>A few questions remain to be discussed: What are the limitations of our simple model?</s><s>Is it compatible with our results on the concentration dependence of the odor responses?</s><s>Lastly, given a proposed model of odor delivery to the receptors, how does coding of odor identity and concentration work?</s></p><p><s>According to our FD model, the front of odor-laden air propagates in the nose with a velocity which increases and then decreases during an inhalation, approximately proportional to nasal cavity pressure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>).</s><s>In a simple version of this model, the propagating front has a sharp boundary, such that odor concentration at the receptors' location will rise as a step function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>).</s><s>In reality, the front boundary is not sharp <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Nachbar and Morton, 1981)</ref>.</s><s>Rather, it spreads as the front propagates along the nasal cavity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>).</s><s>There are few factors which contribute to this effect: (1) due to friction or air viscosity, flow close to the edge of the channel moves more slowly than flow near the center of the channel; (2) due to adsorption by respiratory and olfactory epithelium, odorant concentration decreases along the way.</s><s>Adsorption depends strongly on the physical-chemical properties of an odorant and may significantly differ for hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.</s><s>Thus, concentration increases gradually in any given location of the epithelium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>).</s><s>In addition, receptors of the same type are not localized to one point, but rather are spread through the epithelium, which slows the effective concentration rise even further.</s><s>In future work, these effects can be modeled or simulated.</s><s>At present, our FD model provides a simple explanation of how odor propagation in the nose causes MT cell responses to vary with sniff wave form.</s></p><p><s>The next important step in our model is to define how OSN signals are triggered and conveyed to the OB.</s><s>Most simply, we may assume that OSNs spike when the concentration of a ligand reaches some threshold level.</s><s>Under this assumption, in the case of sharp boundary wave form propagation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>), no matter what the external odorant concentration is, the ligands will arrive at the receptor location at the same time.</s><s>Therefore, time of activation of OSNs and downstream MT cells will be concentration independent.</s><s>However, if ligand concentration at the epithelium gradually increases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>), higher stimulus concentrations will activate OSNs earlier relative to the sniff cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7E</ref>) which is consistent with our previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sirotin et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the qualitative extension of FD model predicts that the latency of OSN activations and following MT cell responses will be shorter for higher stimulus concentration, which will manifest in a smaller effective distance, .</s><s>Based on our measurements of the responses of the same cell to the same odor with different concentrations, at higher concentration is smaller than that for low concentration (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7-1</ref>).</s></p></div>
