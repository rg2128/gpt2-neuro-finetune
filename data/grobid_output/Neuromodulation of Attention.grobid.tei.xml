research indicates that distinct neuromodulators influence attentional control, a mechanistic account that traverses levels of analysis (cells, circuits, behavior) is missing.</s><s>However, such an account is critical to guide the development of next-generation pharmacotherapies aimed at forestalling or remediating the global burden associated with disorders of attention.</s><s>Here, we summarize current neuroscientific understanding of how attention affects single neurons and networks of neurons.</s><s>We then review key results that have informed our understanding of how neuromodulation shapes these neuron and network properties and thereby enables the appropriate allocation of attention to relevant external or internal events.</s><s>Finally, we highlight areas where we believe hypotheses can be formulated and tackled experimentally in the near future, thereby critically increasing our mechanistic understanding of how attention is implemented at the cellular and network levels.</s></p><p><s>The limited processing capacity of the perceptual system poses a complex computational problem for humans and other organisms: which inputs are relevant to current behavioral goals?</s><s>Decades of research has now been devoted to understanding how neurons instantiate the required ''selectivity'' that allows an organism to prioritize, or bias, the processing of relevant over irrelevant inputs.</s><s>Neuronal processing may be biased by both bottom-up and top-down influences.</s><s>The former reflects the biasing of sensory processing due to stimulus saliency (brightness, movement, size, for example), which causes features to ''pop-out'' from their surroundings to capture attention.</s><s>Top-down processing on the other hand reflects the voluntary guidance of attention to locations, features, or objects in the environment.</s><s>In this way, top-down attention allows for the voluntary processing of relevant over irrelevant inputs in line with the current behavioral goals of the organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Desimone and Duncan, 1995)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A network of prefrontal and parietal cortical areas is critically involved in the selection required for top-down attention, and other high-level cognitive functions such as working memory or inhibitory control <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Bichot et al., 2015;</ref><ref

and functionality of this network depend on tightly controlled activity in brainstem neurons that release neuromodulators at their target sites.</s><s>Neuromodulators configure neuronal circuits and thereby specify output properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Marder, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>They thus shape information processing in local and large-scale neuronal networks, such that relevant, over irrelevant, information is prioritized.</s><s>This in turn drives behavior the subject hopes to be rewarding or behavior that minimizes adverse outcomes.</s><s>Understanding precisely how this is achieved at the level of single neurons, local networks, or large-scale networks is vital for basic and clinical neuroscience.</s><s>Neuromodulators most strongly implicated in high-level cognitive functions are acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin</s></p><p><s>(5-HT).</s><s>In this review, we focus on their relevance for top-down attentional control.</s><s>While we will focus on their role in relation to attention, the above neuromodulators have major roles in other aspects of cognition, such as reward signaling (e.g., ACh and DA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Richardson and DeLong, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Rutledge et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Schultz, 2015)</ref>, working memory (DA, NA, <ref

2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Nandam et al., , 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Winstanley et al., 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An important point to address from the outset is how attention, i.e., the top-down prioritization of behaviorally relevant inputs, differs from working memory.</s><s>Working memory can be conceived as an active process whereby stimulus or internal representations are stored ''on-line'' to prevent temporal decay or intrusion from competing or distracting stimuli that are outside the current focus of attention.</s><s>Dissociating effects of attention from those of working memory is difficult and in practice the two processes are highly interactive <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Awh and Jonides, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Attention, as conceptualized in this paper, is a selection mechanism that allows for the preferential processing of task-relevant information over irrelevant (distracting) information, i.e., it is a filter mechanism.</s><s>This selection is driven by currently active behavioral goals held in working memory.</s><s>In that sense, attention acts in the service of working memory.</s><s>However, behavioral paradigms employed in neurophysiological studies highlight the potentially close coupling of attention and working memory (e.g., cue-guided spatial working memory tasks or cue-guided spatial attention task).</s><s>In the cue-guided spatial working memory task, a brief spatial cue will capture attention, which then triggers the working memory signal that enacts the behavioral goal of a memory-guided saccade to cued spatial location.</s><s>We contend that covert spatial attention would also be allocated to the cued location during the memory period, rendering the two processes largely inseparable.</s><s>Here, the neural correlates of either process would be ''delay activity''; that is, activity that occurs (or persists) even after a behaviorally relevant stimulus (or cue) is removed from the sensory environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Fuster, 1973)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, in a cue-guided spatial attention task, a transient cue (either spatial or symbolic) will activate a spatial working memory signal specifying a location that should be monitored for the occurrence of a target, and this monitoring (the preferential processing of information) will be performed by spatial selective attention.</s><s>Again, in this scenario the effects of attention and working memory during the monitoring period are difficult to dissociate, even if the initial generation of the top-down goal (the working memory) may be briefly separable from the attentional signal (the monitoring itself).</s><s>Given the pervasive use of these behavioral paradigms in monkey neurophysiology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Chang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Funahashi et al., 1989)</ref>, we draw on evidence from both in this review.</s></p><p><s>The focus of this review will not be on how the different receptors affect specific aspects of cellular signaling, or how behavioral studies have informed our knowledge of cognitive aspects of attention.</s><s>Rather, we aim to delineate how these neuromodulators enable attentional signaling, either through direct action, or by enabling network states, which favor top-down attentional selection.</s><s>Such a low-level mechanistic account is necessary to validate work that conceptualizes high-level neuromodulator functions from a computational and theoretical perspective (for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Yu and Dayan, 2005)</ref>, and it may help to understand why neuropharmacological manipulations can be task and context specific.</s><s>Finally, such a mechanistic account is required to guide the development of next-generation pharmacotherapies.</s><s>We note from the outset that, although a full understanding of the neuromodulation of attention is not possible given current data, we review the state-of-the-art and highlight important questions that can be addressed in the near future.</s></p><p><s>Neuromodulators act mostly through metabotropic receptors, which activate different G-proteins and thereby trigger second messenger cascades.</s><s>They affect different receptor types and can thereby enhance or reduce transmitter release, synaptic efficacy, or postsynaptic excitability in neuronal circuits.</s><s>Exceptions to the metabotropic neuromodulator pathways exist for ACh, which can act through ionotropic nicotinic receptors, and for 5-HT, which can act through the ionotropic 5-HT3 receptor.</s><s>Detailed reviews regarding the different receptors involved and their action can be found elsewhere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Hein, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Nichols and Nichols, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Thiele, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The effects of these neuromodulators follow the classic Yerkes-Dodson (inverted U-curve) dose-response relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">(Yerkes and Dodson, 1908)</ref>.</s><s>This describes the phenomenon that either too little or too much neuromodulatory drive is equally detrimental to cognitive ability.</s><s>This relationship has been described for ACh <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Smucny et al., 2015)</ref>, DA <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Vijayraghavan et al., 2007)</ref>, NA <ref

2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To link neuromodulatory action to attentional effects on neuronal activity, we first provide a brief account of how topdown attention affects neuronal activity, i.e., attention that is directed to spatial locations, objects, or features of the world.</s><s>Detailed review articles of these effects can be found elsewhere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Desimone and Duncan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Maunsell and Treue, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Maunsell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Miller and Buschman, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Our aim here is to link the effects of attention on single neurons and circuits to those same effects reported for neuromodulators.</s><s>This link is in many cases indirect, as our knowledge of the actions of neuromodulators on cell and population activity arises largely from studies where attention was not manipulated.</s><s>Nevertheless, the extant data allow us to delineate likely scenarios that describe how neuromodulator actions could aid attentional selection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Attention on Neuronal Processing</head><p><s>Over the course of the past 30 years, a large number of studies have delineated the neuronal signatures of top-down attention.</s><s>Top-down attention is defined as the cognitive process by which an individual selects and prioritizes the processing of specific aspects of information.</s><s>This cognitive process has neural correlates, and we use the term ''top-down attention'' as a descriptor of neuronal activity changes that occur following the selection process.</s><s>The behavioral benefits associated with top-down attentional selection are then an emergent property of activity changes in single neurons and in neuronal populations that occur within an area and between multiple areas.</s></p><p><s>One of the main neuronal correlates of attention is an alteration to neuronal firing rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Reynolds et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Spitzer et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Treue and Maunsell, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>Neurons that represent the focus of attention respond differently to the inputs they receive.</s><s>In general, neurons representing attended locations, features, or objects show increased firing rates.</s><s>This phenomenon has been observed across all cortical and subcortical areas investigated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Krauzlis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Noudoost et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>However, attention can also result in suppression of neuronal activity for unattended locations or features <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>The ways in which attention changes neuronal input-output relationships were originally captured by different models of ''gain change.''</s><s>Gain change describes how neuronal input-output relationships are affected by attention.</s><s>These gain changes can take different forms, such that responses are either proportionally increased for all stimuli (response gain change), or mostly for less-salient stimuli (contrast gain change), or by a reduction in responses to less-salient (non-preferred) stimuli and an increase in responses to salient (preferred) stimuli (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr"

can, to some extent, be unified within the normalization model of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Lee and Maunsell, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Mitchell et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Ni et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Sanayei et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This model assumes that attention affects the gain of excitatory, but also of inhibitory neurons, thereby normalizing the increased excitation induced by attention.</s><s>In extrastriate and frontal cortex, attention does indeed increase the activity in putative excitatory and putative inhibitory cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Mitchell et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Thiele et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>At first glance, it may seem counterintuitive that attention increases firing rates, when increased inhibition should counter such an effect.</s><s>However, this effect can be understood in terms of competing neuronal populations that represent different locations of features <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Reynolds et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Attention alters the balance between excitation and inhibition of this competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Reynolds and Heeger, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The attention-induced normalization supports neuronal computations that enable winner-take-all states <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Carandini and Heeger, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Winner-take-all network states occur, for example, when attention biases one neuronal population over another to win the competition for sensory representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Reynolds et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Wang, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The winning population shows increased neuronal activity and suppresses its competitors.</s><s>Competition can also occur in the decision space.</s><s>When multiple decisions are possible but competing, the interaction between the representations converges toward a single (winning) choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Reynolds et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Wang, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>These winner-take-all states occur naturally in neuronal attractor networks.</s><s>Attractor networks move from labile states, where they can undergo regular and easy state transitions, to stable (attractor) states, where one representation dominates.</s><s>The stability of these states is determined by the strength of inhibitory and excitatory drive <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Deco and Hugues, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Deco et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>By increasing inhibitory and excitatory drive, attention can allow competing unstable patterns of neuronal activity (representations) to converge to a more stable pattern of activity, such that a single representation dominates (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> for a Feedback and neuromodulator influences alter the drive in excitatory (blue) and in inhibitory (red) cells, which thereby exert increased influence on one another and the rest of the network, leading to overall increased, but balanced excitation, and inhibition.</s><s>Exemplified are three scenarios, which have been described in the literature when attention is deployed to a spatial location and/or to specific stimulus features.</s><s>These can also occur when neuromodulators are applied to the local network.</s><s>(A) A result thereof is a gain change, i.e., a change of the output a neuron produces given a specific input.</s><s>(B) Another effect of increased balanced excitation and inhibition is an increase in gamma oscillations of the local field potential, indicative of higher neuronal coherence, proposed to improve information exchange between selected neuronal populations.</s><s>(C) Attention and neuromodulators also change the relationship between tuning similarity and noise correlations of neuron pairs, such that population coding properties are improved.</s><s>(D) These changes are reminiscent of altered network attractor dynamics, which stabilize network states, reduce fluctuations, and increase the ability to stay task focused.</s><s>a.u., arbitrary units; Hz, frequency in Hertz.</s></p><p><s>Neuron 97, February 21, 2018 771 Neuron Review schematic).</s><s>These stable activity patterns can be associated with a specific attentional state (such as a location), an item held in working memory, a decision that has been formed, or a motor plan.</s><s>Importantly, the stability of the activity pattern in the attractor network (illustrated by the depth of the valley in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) can be influenced by different neuromodulators (see later parts of the review).</s><s>Cognitive operations or neuromodulators supporting labile states would enhance cognitive flexibility (but potentially at the cost of increased distractibility), whereas cognitive operations or neuromodulators supporting stable states would benefit task focus.</s></p><p><s>Stabilized attractor networks are characterized by increased firing rates for the winning population and decreased firing rates for the losing populations (the described gain changes).</s><s>In addition, stabilized attractor networks exhibit reduced neuronal rate variability and rate co-variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Deco and Hugues, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Deco et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>These effects equally occur in neuronal populations representing the focus of

type="bibr" target="#b191">Thiele et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Increased neuronal gain and reduced rate variability both increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that is, the ability of neurons (or neuronal populations) to distinguish between a relevant and an irrelevant stimulus, to detect the presence or the absence of a stimulus, or discriminate between two different stimuli.</s><s>Alteration of rate co-variability (also termed noise correlation) determines to what extent the neuronal activity in any two cells is redundant and thus limits how much additional information can be obtained by decoding the input from both neurons compared to just one.</s><s>High levels of co-variation can alternately be detrimental, beneficial, or irrelevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbott and Dayan, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Panzeri et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>These outcomes are determined by the tuning similarity between the neurons.</s><s>Specifically, a certain change to the correlational structure of neuronal tuning and of the rate co-variability (noise correlations) increases the amount of information neuronal populations can encode, largely by reducing redundancy (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> for a schematic of this scenario).</s><s>Thus, attention induces gain change, reduces rate variability, and alters noise correlations, which jointly can increase population coding abilities, i.e., the amount of information a population of neurons can encode about different stimulus or task conditions.</s><s>Importantly, altered neuromodulator drive can affect neuronal gain, rate variability, and noise correlations in ways similar to attention.</s></p><p><s>The increase in inhibitory drive may also contribute to attention-induced changes in oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), which requires cyclic bouts of excitation-inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Buschman

target="#b23">(Bauer et al., 2012)</ref> equally are prominent and are assumed to attain specific functional roles.</s><s>For example, de-synchronized alpha oscillations are generally associated with enhanced top-down attentional control <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(O'Connell et al., 2009)</ref>, and beta band oscillations have been discussed as a mechanism that promotes feedback influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Fries, 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is well established that frontal and parietal areas control top-down attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Corbetta and Shulman, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>These areas induce attentional effects in sensory and associative areas through feedback connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Buschman and Miller, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Gregoriou et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Moore and Armstrong, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, frontal areas are connected to brainstem neuromodulator nuclei, whereby they affect their own neuromodulator tone, as well as the neuromodulator tone in other brain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Dembrow and Johnston, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>This pattern of connectivity may account for the similarity of neuronal changes associated with top-down attention and those seen when the brain undergoes large-scale ''state'' changes that are under neuromodulator control <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Harris and Thiele, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Because of this, it has been argued that the changes associated with attention are linked to large-scale changes but occur at a more local level and show more modest effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Harris and Thiele, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Attention indeed controls cortical state in circumscribed neuronal populations within task relevant brain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Engel et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Rabinowitz et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Whether these state changes are induced by direct feedback, by alteration of neuromodulator tone, or by a mix of the two is unknown.</s><s>An equally important question is whether neuromodulators, through tonic release, simply enable network states upon which feedback input can act to induce the described attentional effects.</s><s>Alternatively, or in addition, neuromodulators play a more active role, whereby their phasic and more local release directly supports states of attention at the neuronal level.</s></p><p><s>In the sections that follow, we review the evidence for a direct role of distinct neuromodulators (ACh, DA, NA, 5HT)
