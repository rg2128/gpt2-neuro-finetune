of nuclear transcripts containing introns that are spliced more slowly than other introns within the same gene.</s><s>Many such introns are also present and often conserved in human cell lines as well

we demonstrated that in addition to its known autoregulatory role, Clk kinase activity affects the detention of a specific subset of DIs, and a small-molecule Clk inhibitor can promote the

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>A subset of introns is abundant in mouse and human poly(A) + RNA Surprisingly, deep sequencing of poly(A)-selected RNA from mESCs revealed many transcripts in which specific internal introns were significantly more abundant than other introns within the same transcripts.</s><s>When compared with mapped reads from human ESC (hESC)-derived poly(A) + RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries (The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012), in most cases, the orthologous human introns also exhibit unusually high read coverage, suggesting that this property is biologically conserved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>These intron reads are not from RNAs that are inherently unspliceable or misannotated, since, in all cases, we can detect reads mapping to the junctions between the flanking spliced exons.</s><s>To verify the elevated abundance of high-read-coverage introns in the RNA-seq data sets using an independent method, we measured the intron levels from a number of loci by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using primer sets spanning the exon-intron junctions of high-coverage introns as well as the nearest flanking introns.</s><s>In all cases tested, the high-coverage introns identified by RNA-seq (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, red bars) were markedly more abundant than their flanking neighbors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, blue bars and right panels; data not shown).</s><s>While present at higher levels than other introns in the same transcript, even the most abundant of the high-coverage introns assayed (Ogt intron 4) was estimated to be present in only 30%-50% of poly(A) transcripts based on a comparison with exon-exon signal; measurement of high-coverage introns in fibronectin (Fn1) transcripts showed them to be present in 4%-7% of poly(A) transcripts at steady state (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine the prevalence of high-coverage introns genome-wide, we developed a novel computational pipeline using the R package DESeq <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anders and Huber 2010)</ref> to quantitatively identify introns whose read coverage exceeds the sampling noise present in RNA-seq data sets.</s><s>We identified 3150 such introns (4.2% of internal introns in expressed genes) in mESCs at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% as well as thousands more (5%-15% of expressed introns) in four human cell lines (hESCs, HeLa, HepG2, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs]) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>; Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>; Supplemental Data S1, S2; The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012).</s><s>The differences in DI frequencies were not due to the number of reads mapped (data not shown).</s><s>Of the 2262 high-coverage mouse introns that could be mapped directly to orthologous human introns, 721 (32%) were also significantly enriched in one or more human cell lines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>This degree of overlap is highly statistically significant (P &lt; 2.2 3 10 À16 ), indicative of a phylogenetically conserved regulatory process.</s><s>This conservation strongly suggests that the property of posttranscriptional splicing for specific introns has a biological function that underlies their selection over time.</s><s>Because these introns remain present in polyadenylated transcripts in which all other introns have been spliced out and are retained in the nucleus (see below), we refer to them as DIs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Properties of DIs</head><p><s>It has been observed that introns flanking alternatively spliced exons are removed more slowly than the constitutive introns in the same transcript (Pandya-Jones and Black 2009;

a significantly higher percentage (19.4%) of constitutive introns with an identifiable human ortholog are DIs, compared with 6.3% of constitutive introns with no identifiable homologous intron in humans (P &lt;

evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that this property serves an important regulatory function.</s><s>DIs are statistically enriched adjacent to alternatively spliced exons, but the majority of DIs are categorized as constitutive introns, thus separating this property from processes that regulate alternative splicing.</s><s>Indeed, constitutive DIs are also statistically evolutionarily conserved, further indicating that they have important regulatory functions.</s><s>As identification of orthologous introns is complicated by a large amount of evolutionarily neutral intron sequences, we consider the conserved set of DIs to be a stringent estimate that likely underestimates the number of functionally conserved DIs.</s><s>The slow rate of splicing of some nonconserved DIs relative to their flanking introns may simply be due to less efficient engagement with spliceosomal processes resulting from variation in splice sites, making their excision rate limiting for transport.</s><s>However, as discussed above, we showed that subsets of DIs undergo changes in splicing rates in response to cellular signals and/or under cell type-specific conditions, indicating that the slower splicing of these DIs is a regulated process rather than the result of suboptimal splice site variation.</s></p><p><s>DIs constitute a uniquely regulated subset that spans all types of splicing events and are not simply a manifestation of processes associated with alternative splicing.</s><s>Although the vast majority of DIs contain PTCs, these transcripts are not NMD substrates, as they do not increase in abundance when NMD is inhibited and are confined to the nuclear fraction in a distinct pattern from known NMD substrates.</s><s>This suggests that DIs are present in incompletely processed transcripts rather than transcripts that are exported and translated.</s><s>The slow decay rate of DIs upon inhibition of transcription is consistent with a fate of ultimately being either spliced or degraded as part of the precursor RNA within the nucleus.</s><s>The latter may be related to a recently discovered developmental regulation mechanism in which inhibition of splicing of a 39-terminal intron leads to destruction of the transcript through nuclear degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Yap et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The possibility that many DIs represent a rate-limiting intermediate is suggestive of a process observed in recent studies using lipid A-induced macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bhatt et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pandya-Jones et al. 2013)</ref> in which there is a delay of tens of minutes between transcription of a gene and the removal of all introns, which occurs in a chromatin-associated fraction, thus demonstrating that splicing rates can determine the kinetics of gene expression.</s><s>However, in these cases, all or most introns in the genes appeared to be similarly delayed, whereas DIs are distinctly present in transcripts that are otherwise fully spliced.</s><s>Similarly, a large number of transcripts containing all of their introns unspliced accumulated in nuclear fractions from heatshocked fibroblasts, while cotranscriptionally spliced genes were unaffected <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Shalgi et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, a large group of introns enriched in polyadenylated transcripts that may partially overlap DIs were recently characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Braunschweig et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s>However, these introns were enriched in untranslated regions (UTRs), were negatively correlated with gene expression, and were frequently targeted by NMD, which indicates that many of this set of introns are distinct from the ones that we identify here and further underscores the complexity of regulatory processes involving regulation of splicing kinetics.</s></p><p><s>The Hagiwara group <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ninomiya et al. 2011</ref>) previously identified introns in the Clk1 and Clk4 kinase genes that we now assign to a much larger class of DIs.</s><s>We confirmed their previous observations that the introns in Clk1 undergo rapid post-transcriptional splicing upon drug inhibition of Clk kinase activity and performed the first genome-wide analysis of the effects of Clk inhibitor.</s><s>We found that, beyond the autoregulation of DIs in their own transcripts, the Clk kinases likely modulate splicing rates of &gt;300 other DIs directly, since the response to Clk inhibition occurs at a very early time (2 h) after treatment.</s><s>Assuming a constant rate of transcription, the magnitude by which the mRNA pool increases in response to CB19 treatment is dependent on the amount of precursor RNA that is degraded under steady-state conditions.</s><s>For example, we observed a twofold increase in Clk1 coding mRNA and a 90% decrease in Clk1 DI-containing transcripts 2 h after CB19 treatment.</s><s>The half-life of Clk1 mRNA was previously estimated at 39 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Friedel et al. 2009)</ref>, and since this is much shorter than 2 h, with no detectable increase in transcription, the increase in mRNA levels must reflect an increase in the efficiency of splicing.</s><s>The increase in spliced mRNA could result from either enhanced splicing efficiency in general or, more likely, redirection of DI-containing precursors fluxing through a nuclear degradation pathway to an efficient splicing pathway or both (see the model in Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>An important clue into a physiological role of the Clk kinases is that heat shock and osmotic stress activate the same induction of DI splicing in the Clk precursor RNA as inhibition of the kinase activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ninomiya et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Three other Clk family members have

types and disease states, including global stress responses.</s><s>It has previously been observed that the Clk inhibitor TG003 triggered an increase in Mdm4 NMD isoform splicing, a corresponding decrease in Mdm4 protein, and up-regulation of p53 protein levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allende-Vega et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bezzi et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This effect was attributed to induction of stress due to a general inhibition of splicing, since knockdown or genetic perturbation of core spliceosome components had a similar effect on Mdm4 and p53.</s><s>Here we performed the first genome-wide analysis of the effect of Clk inhibitors, and our data clearly indicate that, far from being a general inhibitor of splicing, CB19 has a very specific effect on a subset of splicing events.</s><s>Both Clk inhibition and DNA damage affect the splicing of subsets of DIs, and the additive effect on Mdm4 splicing when both drugs are present simultaneously indicates that they may act through overlapping but distinct pathways.</s><s>The rapid and profound effect on Mdm4 splicing seen upon treatment with CB19, doxorubicin, or both (70% coding down to &lt;20% at 4 h after treatment), accompanied by an approximately twofold increase in the amount of DI-containing transcripts, is strong evidence for the physiological role of regulated DI splicing, and the observed shift in splicing of Mdm4 transcripts is likely responsible at least in part for the up-regulation of p53 protein and the corresponding p53 transcriptional response.</s></p><p><s>While the earliest steps in spliceosome assembly require SR protein phosphorylation to enhance specific RNA binding as well as interaction with the U1-70k RS domain <ref

The plot shows the ratio of DIs relative to the total transcript level of each gene in doxorubicin compared with DMSO and the relative change in spliced isoform levels of each gene of the NMD substrate (NMD), CDS, and total transcript in Mdm4 (C) and Bclaf1 (D).</s><s>Bars represent the average, and error bars are SEM; n = 3. Schematics indicating the structure of the NMD switch exons and flanking DIs are shown below.</s><s>(E, middle) DIs in genes expressed in either mESCs or adult mouse liver samples or both (Venn diagram).</s><s>DAVID GO analysis of genes expressed only in mESCs (left) or livers (right) that contain DIs are shown with fold enrichment and the Àlog 10 of the FDR for each category graphed.</s><s>(F) Relative intron detention (RID) levels for all introns expressed in both mESCs and livers.</s><s>(Left) RID for introns found in genes expressed in both cell types but only detained in mESCs and not livers.</s><s>(Right) Introns detained only in livers but not mESCs.</s><s>(Middle) Introns detained in both cell types.</s><s>See also Supplemental Figs.</s><s>S6 and S7.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="12,72.51,57.77,445.60,566.93" type="bitmap" /></figure>
