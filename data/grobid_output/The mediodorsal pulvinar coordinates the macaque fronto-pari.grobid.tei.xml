attention with critical flexibility, offering windows of opportunity when it is easier to disengage from the presently attended location and move to another location.</s><s>But how are these

measured neuronal responses in the dorsal pulvinar during spatial attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , and its functional role in the attention

spikes online to isolate neurons, and then resorted spikes for offline analyses using Plexon Offline Sorter software.</s><s>The Egly-Driver task has four target locations, one in each quadrant.</s><s>To determine where individual neurons and LFPs had their strongest responses, we compared responses to the spatial cue in each quadrant and during a quadrant-mapping task (i.e., large Gabor stimuli flashed in each quadrant).</s></p><p><s>Here, we present data from 95 recording sessions in the mediodorsal pulvinar (mdPul; monkey L, N = 55, monkey R, N = 40).</s><s>We also simultaneously recorded from FEF and LIP.</s><s>There were 51 recording sessions when mdPul and FEF had there strongest responses to stimuli in the same visual quadrant, 58 recording sessions when mdPul and LIP had there strongest responses in the same visual quadrant, and 67 recording sessions when FEF and LIP had their strongest responses to stimuli within the same visual quadrant (i.e., aligned RFs and/or multi-unit RFs).</s><s>We used these recording sessions for between-region analyses.</s><s>There were 31 recording sessions when all three ROIs had their strongest responses to stimuli within the same visual quadrant.</s><s>We used these recording sessions to confirm that our between-region analyses of Granger causality were still valid when accounting for the influence of the third region (i.e., conditional Granger causality).</s><s>Across all recording sessions, we isolated 52 task-responsive neurons in mdPul, 98 in FEF, and 98 in LIP.</s><s>These neurons had significantly increased spike rates in response to the cue, the target, or both the cue and the target.</s></p><p><s>Acquisition of MR images for electrode positioning.</s><s>We sedated the animals with ketamine (1-10 mg/kg i.m.) and xylazine (1-2 mg/kg i.m.), and also provided atropine (0.04 mg/kg i.m.).</s><s>Sedation was maintained with tiletamine/zolazepam (1-5 mg/kg i.m.).</s><s>We then placed the animals in an MR-compatible stereotaxic frame (1530 M; David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga CA) and monitored vital signs with wireless ECG and respiration sensors (Siemens AG, Berlin DEU) and a fiber optic temperature probe (FOTS100; Biopac Systems Inc, Goleta CA).</s><s>We maintained body temperature with blankets and a warm water re-circulating pump (TP600; Stryker Corp., Kalamazoo, MI).</s></p><p><s>We collected structural MRI data for the whole brain on a Siemens 3 T MAGNETOM Skyra using a Siemens 11-cm loop coil placed above the head.</s><s>A high-quality structural image was created for each animal by averaging 6-8 threedimensional (3D) T1-weighted (T1w) volumes acquired in a single scan session (3D Magnetization-Prepared Rapid-Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence, voxel size: 0.5 mm, slice orientation: sagittal, slice thickness: 0.5 mm, field of view (FoV): 128 × 128 mm, FoV phase: 100%, repetition time (TR): 2700 ms, echo time (TE): 2.78 ms, inversion time (TI): 861 ms, base resolution: 256 × 256, acquisition time (TA): 11 min 31 s).</s><s>T2-weighted (T2w) volumes were acquired with a 3D turbo spin echo with variable flip-angle echo trains (3D T2-SPACE) sequence (voxel size: 0.5 mm, slice orientation: sagittal, slice thickness: 0.5 mm, FoV: 128 × 128 mm, FoV phase: 79.7%, TR: 3390 ms, TE: 386 ms, base resolution: 256 × 256, TA: 17 min 51 s.</s><s>We used these T2w volumes both to select coordinates for chamber placements and to position electrodes for recordings.</s><s>Platinum-iridium electrodes create a clearly identifiable, susceptibility-induced signal void along the length of the electrodes in structural MRI images.</s><s>This "shadow" has a width of approximately one voxel (0.5 mm 3 on either side of the electrode), allowing us to visualize electrode placement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Prior to recordings, we positioned electrodes just dorsal to our ROIs.</s><s>The electrodes were then held in situ by customized guide tubes and lowered into the cortex over the course of typically 1 week of recordings.</s><s>We then acquired additional structural MRI data prior to replacing the electrodes.</s><s>We used the before and after images, as well as daily microdrive measurements, to reconstruct electrode tracks.</s></p><p><s>To further localize electrode penetrations, we aligned the D99 digital template atlas to each individual animal's high-quality T1w MRI volume, using a combination of FSL and AFNI software tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> .</s><s>The D99 atlas is based on and aligned to MRI and histological data from the Saleem and Logothetis 62 atlas, and allows identification of labeled areas within the native 3D MRI volume of an individual animal.</s><s>Briefly, we first extracted the brains from the T1w MRI volumes using the FSL brain extraction tool (BET) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> .</s><s>We then implemented the pipeline provided by Reveley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> to align the atlas to each monkey's MRI volume.</s><s>This pipeline included a sequence of affine and nonlinear registration steps to first align the individual animal's MRI volume to the atlas, then inverting the transformations to warp the atlas to the animal's original native space.</s><s>Once aligned, we overlaid the warped atlas' anatomical subdivisions upon the individual monkey's high-quality T1w MRI volume, co-registered the T2w MRI volumes that contained electrode penetrations, and visualized penetration locations with respect to the warped atlas on the animal's anatomy.</s><s>For all recordings presented here, the electrodes were positioned in atlas-defined mdPul (labeled as medial pulvinar in the Saleem and Logothetis 62 atlas), FEF, and LIP. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows all of the mdPul penetrations.</s><s>Fiebelkorn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> include representative penetrations into FEF and LIP.</s></p><p><s>Spike rate.</s><s>For all analyses, we used a combination of customized MATLAB (MATLAB R2016a, The Mathworks Inc., Natick MA) functions and the Fieldtrip toolbox (http://www.ru.nl/neuroimaging/fieldtrip) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> .</s><s>We measured spike rates by convolving trial-level data with a Gaussian filter (σ = 10 ms) and then averaging across trials.</s><s>We then used a non-parametric, randomization procedure to determine whether each neuron demonstrated an increased spike rate in response to either the cue or the target (i.e., within 250 ms after cue or target presentation).</s><s>First, we randomly sampled a response-value from the pre-cue period (-350 to 0 ms) of each trial and averaged those response-values across trials to get a baseline spike rate.</s><s>We then repeated this procedure 5000 times to generate a reference distribution.</s><s>To generate a p-value, we determined the proportion of values in the reference distribution that exceeded the observed value from collected data.</s><s>For all statistical comparisons, unless otherwise specified, we adopted an alpha criterion of 0.05, and used the Holm's sequential Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparisons.</s></p><p><s>For population peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), we grand-averaged spike rates across task-responsive neurons, after first normalizing the spike rate of each neuron based on its maximum response.</s><s>For between-condition (i.e., cued vs. uncued) statistical comparisons, we first averaged the response across a pre-target window, spanning 500 ms prior to target presentation.</s><s>We then conducted a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>LFP power estimates.</s><s>To estimate LFP power in mdPul (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), we used a fast Fourier transform (FFT) after first applying a Hanning window.</s><s>Here, we examined power both before and after the cue was presented, restricting our analysis window to the 500 ms prior to either the cue or the target, and only including trials when the bar-cue and cue-target delay was at least 750 ms (i.e., to avoid the cue-evoked sensory response).</s><s>In order to isolate oscillatory peaks from the 1/f background activity (i.e., to disentangle oscillatory from fractal components), we utilized irregular resampling (IRASA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> .</s><s>IRASA takes advantage of the fact that irregular resampling of the neuronal signal by pairwise non-integer values slightly shifts the peak frequency of oscillatory signals by compressing or stretching the underlying signal.</s><s>The 1/f component, in comparison, remains constant during resampling.</s></p><p><s>We used the results of IRASA to subtract 1/f estimates (i.e., the fractal component) from the original FFT results, isolating oscillatory residuals (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>We then averaged our results across recording sessions.</s><s>We restricted our analyses to frequencies below 60 Hz, as frequencies above this cut-off have been shown to reflect a broadband, non-oscillatory neural signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Phase-detection relationships.</s><s>We investigated whether behavioral performance (i.e., hit rate) was associated with the oscillatory phase in the frequency-specific LFP signal, adapting an approach previously applied to EEG data <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>We focused on the pre-target signal, convolving complex Morlet wavelets (from 3 to 60 Hz) with the LFP signal just prior to target presentation.</s><s>We then derived pre-target phase estimates by taking the angle of the complex output.</s></p><p><s>We next sorted trials by phase and calculated HRs within overlapping, 180°p hase bins (e.g., 0-180°).</s><s>That is, we shifted our phase window in 5°steps (e.g., 5-185°, then 10-190°, etc.) until we generated phase-dependent HRs, spanning all phases for each frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>This analysis created a function that represented the frequency-specific relationship between oscillatory phase and visual-target detection.</s><s>We hypothesized a signature shape for this relationship, with a peak in visual-target detection separated from a trough by approximately 180°.</s><s>Based on this hypothesis, we captured the strength of these phase-detection functions at each frequency by applying FFTs and keeping the second component.</s><s>The absolute value of this second component represents the amplitude of an oscillation with a single cycle, matching the hypothesized shape (i.e., with a peak in visual-target detection separated from a trough by approximately 180°).</s></p><p><s>For statistical testing, we broke the relationship between phase and behavioral performance by shuffling the observed pre-target phase measurements relative to the observed behavioral outcomes (i.e., hits and misses).</s><s>We re-shuffled the data 1500 times and repeated the analysis steps (as described above).</s><s>We then compared the resulting reference distributions at each frequency to the observed phasedetection relationships (accounting for multiple comparisons).</s></p><p><s>The present results revealed a significant relationship between oscillatory phase in the theta band and the likelihood of visual-target detection.</s><s>We previously reported such a dependency between theta phase in higher-order cortex (i.e., FEF and LIP) and phase-detection relationships at higher frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>We therefore next examined whether phase-detection relationships in mdPul follow the same pattern, with phase-detection relationships at higher frequencies similarly being dependent on the phase of theta-band activity (at 5 Hz).</s><s>We first binned trials into two theta-phase (180°) bins, the first centered on the peak in the previously measured phase-detection function (i.e., the "good" theta phase) and the second centered on the trough (i.e., the "poor" theta phase) in the previously measured phase-detection function (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>We then re-calculated the phase-detection relationships from 9 to 60 Hz, separately for each theta-phase bin (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine statistical significance, we used the same approach described above to break the relationship between phase and behavioral performance, but here we did it separately for each of the two theta-phase bins.</s><s>This statistical analysis therefore determined whether there were significant links between visualtarget detection and oscillatory phase at higher frequencies (from 9 to 60 Hz) within each theta-phase bin.</s></p><p><s>Spike-LFP phase coupling.</s><s>We measured whether spikes in one brain region clustered at specific phases of the frequency-specific LFP signal (from 3 to 60 Hz) in the other region (e.g., spike times in FEF relative to oscillatory phase in LIP).</s><s>As a measure of functional connectivity, spike-LFP phase coupling avoids spurious coupling associated with using a common recording reference, which can sometimes make it difficult to interpret LFP-LFP phase coupling.</s><s>For each spike time within a window from -500 to -125 ms prior to target presentation, we calculated corresponding phase estimates from the LFPs (centered on the spike time).</s><s>We used the pairwise phase consistency (PPC) to measure spike-LFP phase coupling independent of differences in spike counts or trial numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> .</s><s>Higher PPC values indicate a greater clustering of spikes at specific phases of frequency-specific oscillatory activity in the LFP signal.</s><s>For between-region analyses, increased spike-LFP phase coupling (as measured with PPC) is thought to reflect increased network connectivity.</s><s>Although not a causal measure, spike-LFP phase coupling is also often interpreted with directionality, with spikes being interpreted as an output signal and LFPs being interpreted as an input signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s></p><p><s>For statistical testing, we (i) shuffled (1500 times) trials between conditions (cued vs. uncued) and (ii) re-calculated the difference in PPC between the shuffled conditions.</s><s>We then compared the resulting reference distributions with the observed difference in PPC values.</s></p><p><s>We also measured spike-LFP phase coupling (from 9 to 60 Hz) as a function of theta phase (at 5 Hz).</s><s>Here, we iteratively calculated spike-LFP phase coupling in overlapping, 180°phase windows (e.g., 0-180°), shifting the phase window in 5°s teps (e.g., 5-185°, then 10-190°, etc.).</s><s>To measure the strength of any link between theta phase and spike-LFP phase coupling at higher frequencies, we hypothesized a signature shape, with a peak in theta-dependent spike-LFP phase coupling separated from a trough by approximately 180°(i.e., the same signature shape that we previously hypothesized for relationships between oscillatory phase and the likelihood of visual-target detection).</s><s>That is, we hypothesized that there would be a theta phase with particularly strong spike-LFP phase coupling (at higher frequencies), and 180°away from that phase, a theta phase with particularly weak spike-LFP phase coupling (at higher frequencies).</s><s>Based on this hypothesis, we reduced theta-dependent, spike-LFP phase coupling functions to a single value for each frequency by applying FFTs and keeping the second component <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>This second component represents the amplitude of an oscillation with a single cycle, matching our hypothesized shape (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Higher oscillatory power is associated with more reliable phase estimates.</s><s>Changes in power as a function of theta phase (i.e., PAC) could thus create spurious relationships between spike-LFP phase coupling and theta phase.</s><s>We controlled for this relationship between power and phase estimates by conducting a control analysis that equated higher-frequency power between theta-phase bins.</s><s>We compared theta-phase bins centered at 90°and 270°, using the ft_stratify function from the FieldTrip toolbox (Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior), which also equates sample sizes.</s><s>A key element of this stratification procedure is a subsampling of the original dataset to equate power, with this subsampling being somewhat different on each run.</s><s>We therefore re-ran the stratification procedure 1500 times.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref> displays the mean and standard deviation of these power-equating iterations, confirming the theta-dependent results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Granger causality.</s><s>We estimated the influence of the different ROIs on each other (e.g., the influence of mdPul on LIP) by measuring Granger causality when response fields in each ROI overlapped the cued location.</s><s>We first downsampled the data to 250 Hz, subtracted the mean, and then divided by the standard deviation.</s><s>For MVAR modeling, with the BSMART toolbox for MATLAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> , we used a model order of 8, which generally corresponded to the first Akaike information criterion value.</s><s>For paired estimates (e.g., mdPul vs. LIP), we averaged across all recording sessions when each of two ROIs had overlapping response fields.</s><s>We also calculated conditional Granger causality for a subset of recording sessions when all three ROIs had overlapping response fields (N = 31).</s><s>Conditional Granger causality measures the influence of one brain area (Y) on another (X), after taking into account additional areas (Z).</s><s>The general pattern of results for Granger causal influence between ROIs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) remained the same when instead applying conditional Granger causality (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also examined Granger causal influence as a function of theta phase.</s><s>We first used a two-cycle wavelet to measure the phase of theta-band activity just prior to target presentation.</s><s>The wavelet was centered at -250 ms.</s><s>We then sorted trials into two theta-phase bins (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>), one centered on the theta phase associated with enhanced perceptual sensitivity (i.e., the "good" theta phase) and the other centered on the theta phase associated with diminished perceptual sensitivity (i.e., the poor theta phase).</s><s>For each theta-phase bin, we measured Granger causal influence using an epoch also centered at -250 ms (prior to target presentation), but only overlapping a time period equivalent to half of a theta cycle.</s></p><p><s>For statistical testing, we re-shuffled the trial data and re-calculated Granger causality for each of 1500 iterations.</s><s>We then compared the compiled reference distribution of differences between, for example, mdPul to LIP and LIP to mdPul Granger causal influence to the observed values (controlling for multiple comparisons).</s></p><p><s>Cross-frequency PAC.</s><s>We first examined PAC between FEF and LIP, focusing exclusively on the relationship between oscillatory phase in one region and highfrequency band (HFB) activity (from 80 to 200 Hz) in the other.</s><s>HFB is an established proxy for population spiking <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>We convolved complex Morlet wavelets with the LFP signal prior to target presentation (from -750 to -200 ms, in 10-ms steps), using the results to (i) derive phase estimates from 9 to 35 Hz (in 1-Hz steps) and (ii) to extract HFB activity.</s><s>To get HFB, we first calculated power in 10-Hz steps (i.e., 80, 90, 100…).</s><s>We then baseline corrected these power estimates by means of a z-score, relative to the pre-cue baseline, before averaging across HFB frequencies (from 80 to 200 Hz).</s><s>Note that this approach accounts for the 1/f signal drop off in HFB at increasing frequencies.</s></p><p><s>We next sorted frequency-specific phase estimates (from 9 to 35 Hz) and calculated average HFB power within overlapping 180°phase bins (e.g., 0-180°), shifting the smoothing window in 5°steps (e.g., 5-185°, then 10-190°, etc.).</s><s>To aid in visual comparisons across frequencies, we normalized these phase-power relationships by subtracting and dividing by the average power across all phases (separately for each frequency).</s><s>We then multiplied by 100 to reveal the percent modulation in HFB power as a function of the oscillatory phase.</s><s>The preceding steps (i.e., binning power estimates by phase) are similar to other approaches that measure PAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> .</s><s>Here, we specifically hypothesized that PAC should have a signature shape, with a peak in PAC separated from a trough by approximately 180°(i.e., the same signature shape that we previously hypothesized for relationships between oscillatory phase and the likelihood of visual-target detection).</s><s>We therefore reduced phase-power functions to a single value for each phase-providing frequency by applying the FFT to each function (i.e., at each frequency, from 3 to 60 Hz) and keeping the second component.</s><s>This second component represents a one-cycle sine wave, matching the hypothesized shape of our phase-power functions.</s><s>The amplitude of this one-cycle, sinusoidal component -determined both by how closely the function approximated a one-cycle sine wave and by the effect size-was used to measure the strength of PAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>We used the same procedure to measure within-region PAC for mdPul (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), specifically examining the link between theta phase (at 5 Hz) and higherfrequency power (from 9 to 60 Hz).</s><s>We previously reported within-region PAC (from 9 to 60 Hz) for FEF and LIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>We also used this procedure to examine PAC between alpha/low-beta phase and gamma power, separately for the "good" and "poor" theta-phase bins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</s></p><p><s>For statistical testing, we (i) shuffled our observed pre-target phase estimates (1500 times) relative to observed power (breaking the relationship between phase and power) and (ii) repeated our analysis steps.</s><s>We then compared the magnitude of resulting reference distributions to the observed PAC (accounting for multiple comparisons).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.1Penetrations targeting the atlas-defined mediodorsal
