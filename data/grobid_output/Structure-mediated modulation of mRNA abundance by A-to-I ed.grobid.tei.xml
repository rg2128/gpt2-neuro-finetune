focus of a number of studies, given its potentially profound impact on gene expression.</s><s>For example, inosine-containing transcripts are digested by the endonuclease V enzyme, providing a direct mechanism for the control of RNA stability by A-to-I editing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>A-to-I editing and ADAR proteins can also indirectly affect RNA stability by influencing the abundance or sequences of microRNA (miRNA) molecules, potent regulators of gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr"

.</s></p><p><s>In addition to affecting miRNA sequences or expression, it has been speculated that A-to-I editing may modify the sequences of miRNA target sites in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs.</s><s>This hypothesis is attractive as it may explain the functional roles of many editing sites in the non-coding 3′ UTR regions.</s><s>In fact, specific examples where A-to-I editing

target="#b27">[28]</ref> .</s><s>However, there are seemingly contradictory reports on the predicted prevalence of RNA editing sites that alter miRNA target sequences.</s><s>Some studies proposed that RNA editing tends to avoid miRNA target sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , while others suggested that RNA editing is enriched in miRNA target regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Considering these results, further investigation and rigorous experimental validation are needed to elucidate the functional roles of non-coding

editing and its functional mechanisms.</s><s>One potentially powerful approach is to analyze the differences in RNA editomes present in a large number of individuals.</s><s>This strategy can uncover the biological, functional or environmental factors that cause variations in RNA editing.</s><s>In this study, we report a comprehensive analysis of RNA editing across five human populations.</s><s>Many editing sites are shared among individuals and have similar editing levels, which are not fully explained by the expression of ADAR proteins.</s><s>Through detailed analyses

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>RNA editing sites differ in prevalence within a population.</s><s>To obtain a global view of RNA editing in human populations, we analyzed RNA-Seq data sets of 462 human individuals of the 1000 Genomes project.</s><s>These subjects represent five populations: Utah residents with northern and western European ancestries (CEU; 91 individuals), Finnish in Finland (FIN; 95), British in England and Scotland (GBR; 94), Toscani in Italy (TSI; 93), and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI; 87).</s><s>Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from blood and polyA-selected RNA samples were sequenced <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>RNA-Seq data were analyzed using our previously developed methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> (see Methods).</s></p><p><s>A total of 28,848 distinct editing sites were identified in the 462 samples.</s><s>In a single subject, the number of predicted editing sites ranged from ~200 to ~3500, which approximately correlated with RNA-Seq read coverage of the samples (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>On average, 90% of the editing sites in each individual were of the A-to-G type, reflecting A-to-I editing (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>This high percentage suggests a high accuracy of our RNA editing identification method, as previously shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Henceforth, we will restrict our analyses to A-to-G sites, since non-A-to-G substitutions constituted a minor fraction and demonstrated little overlap among individuals in general.</s></p><p><s>To enable inter-individual comparisons, we further focused on editing sites that satisfy the following criteria: (1) ≥ 2 reads with the edited nucleotide and an editing level ≥ 0.1 in ≥ 3 individuals of a population; and (2) read coverage ≥ 10 in ≥ 10% individuals of a population.</s><s>These cutoffs were chosen to achieve a trade-off between the total number of selected sites and the fraction of Ato-G sites (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1a-c</ref>).</s><s>It should be noted that the %A-to-G sites among all unique sites in a population was lower than that among all sites in one individual (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</s><s>This is because A-to-G sites, but not non-A-to-G sites, often occurred in multiple individuals.</s><s>More than 4300 editing sites in each population satisfied the above criteria (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</s><s>A total of 8080 editing sites were identified in the union of all populations, 97% and 61% of which overlapped those in the RADAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> and DARNED 36 databases, respectively.</s><s>These 8080 editing sites were located in 909 genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>) and most often resided in 3′ UTRs (77%), followed by introns (14%; Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>).</s><s>Only a small fraction (1.6%) was found in the coding regions of mRNAs and in 5′ UTRs (1%).</s><s>Interestingly, among genes with the largest number of editing sites, many have known functions related to immune response with editing sites exclusively in the 3′ UTRs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>).</s><s>It should be noted that the above editing sites are a conservative representation of all editing sites in the populations, due to limited sequencing depth and possible preclusion of sites in hyper-edited regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We next analyzed the prevalence of editing sites within each of the five populations.</s><s>We defined the prevalence of each editing Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Comparison of prevalent and rare editing sites.</s><s>a Sequence preference for positions flanking prevalent and rare A-to-I editing sites, represented using a two-sample logo program <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> .</s><s>A total of 714 prevalent (prevalence &gt; 90%) and 3618 rare (prevalence ≤ 10%) editing sites were included, respectively.</s><s>The number of occurrences of the 'UAG' motif is shown below each graph.</s><s>The 'UAG' sequence is significantly enriched around prevalent sites compared to rare sites (p = 1.4e-9,</s><s>Fisher's Exact test).</s><s>Prevalent and rare editing sites were defined using editing sites of the union of all individuals (same below).</s><s>b Average number of paired nucleotides in a sliding window of 9 nucleotides (corresponding to the length of ADAR binding region <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> ) near prevalent (red) and rare (blue) editing sites, and near random adenosines (gray) located 200-300 nucleotides from editing sites.</s><s>Shaded areas represent the standard error of the mean.</s><s>Horizontal black bar indicates the region where there are significant differences between the numbers of paired nucleotides around prevalent and rare editing sites (p &lt; 0.01, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test).</s><s>c Variance in editing levels across individuals explained by ADAR expression levels (ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3) in a linear model.</s><s>Average values of rare (3618 sites), all (8080) and prevalent sites (714) are shown (ordered as the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd bar in each group, respectively).</s><s>Error bars represent confidence intervals site as the percentage of individuals with the sites edited among those that were testable for this editing event (i.e., ≥10 read coverage).</s><s>The five populations demonstrated similar distributions of editing site prevalence (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>), with the majority of sites having prevalence &lt;50%.</s><s>However, a considerable subset of editing sites (~700) in each population had a prevalence of 90% or higher.</s><s>In addition, prevalent editing sites showed higher editing levels than relatively rare sites (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>).</s><s>Note that detection of low editing levels depends on read coverage, which may confound the measure of prevalence.</s><s>As rare sites have relatively low editing levels, edited reads may not be observed in all truly edited individuals given limited read coverage.</s><s>Thus, the prevalence shown here, especially for rare sites, may be an underestimate of the true prevalence, although the majority of rare sites defined here should have relatively low true prevalence (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Prevalent editing sites represent strong ADAR substrates.</s><s>We next examined the genomic, regulatory and functional features of rare (≤10% prevalence) and prevalent (&gt;90% prevalence) editing sites.</s><s>The regional location within a transcript was highly similar for the two groups (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>).</s><s>In addition, there was no significant difference in expression levels of genes harboring these editing sites (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>).</s><s>This observation indicates that the prevalence measure is not confounded by gene expression level.</s><s>Indeed, rare editing sites had slightly higher average read coverage than prevalent sites (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>), consistent with our earlier observation that rare editing sites had relatively low editing levels (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>) and thus require more reads to be detected.</s><s>The sequence contexts (±1 nt) of rare and prevalent editing sites showed a significant difference (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>In particular, prevalent sites were associated with the typical sequence signature known for ADAR substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>The motif UAG was significantly more enriched around prevalent sites than rare sites.</s><s>Furthermore, compared with rare editing sites, sequences flanking prevalent sites were in stronger double-stranded structures (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>Notably, the sequence neighborhood of both  rare and prevalent editing sites showed a higher propensity for double-stranded structures than random adenosines located 200-300 nt away from editing sites (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>This observation indicates that rare editing sites are also ADAR target sites.</s><s>Altogether, the above sequence and structural properties suggest that prevalent editing sites are stronger ADAR substrates compared to rare sites.</s><s>It should be noted that the above sequence and structural differences between rare and prevalent editing sites may partially reflect the properties of sites with different editing levels.</s><s>As prevalent sites have higher editing levels than rare sites (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>), it is expected that they are stronger ADAR substrates.</s><s>Consistently, based on linear regression, ADAR expression levels explained a relatively larger fraction of the variance in editing levels of prevalent sites than at rare ones (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>).</s><s>Nevertheless, the stronger correlation between ADAR expression and editing levels for prevalent sites may have been partially enabled by the presumably higher accuracy of their estimated editing levels.</s><s>Overall, ADAR expression explained a relatively small fraction of editing variance (on average ~11% for all sites in each population).</s><s>The same observation holds if ADAR protein expression levels were used (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>), although ADAR mRNA and proteins levels show moderate correlation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>), or if an editing index <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> was used instead of the average editing level (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In general, this low contribution of ADAR expression to editing variance could be due to low ADAR expression variability across individuals or existence of other regulators that mediate editing variation.</s></p><p><s>Compared to those with rare editing sites, genes harboring prevalent editing sites were enriched in functional categories related to cell-cycle regulation and cell proliferation.</s><s>Intriguingly, the most significantly enriched categories were sexual reproduction and negative regulation of viral genome replication (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>No enriched categories were found among genes with rare editing sites.</s><s>Our findings are in line with recent studies that reported the involvement of ADAR1 in innate immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and that A-to-I editing occurs specifically during sexual reproduction in the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Populations share editing sites with low-level differences.</s><s>With the above analyses focused on within-population comparisons, we next examined the differences and similarities of RNA editomes between populations.</s><s>Among all editing sites included in Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>, the majority was edited in at least 2 populations, with nearly 3000 sites shared by all five populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>).</s><s>Only about 100-300 sites were specific to any one of the five populations.</s><s>These observed population-specific editing sites were unlikely a consequence of inadequate power for their detection in other populations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>A pairwise comparison of RNA editing sites revealed significant overlap between all pairs of b AGO2 RPKM value .</s><s>c Editing level differences (AGO2 KD minus control, K562 cells) of two groups of editing sites identified in the Geuvadis RNA-Seq data.</s><s>Left: editing sites located in 3′ UTRs within 500 nt from predicted miRNA target sites; right:

genes (with number of genes indicated on top).</s><s>Group 1 consists of genes with editing sites (identified in the Geuvadis RNA-Seq data) within 500 nt from predicted miRNA target sites (left box in each panel); group 2 consists of genes without editing sites in 3′ UTRs (right box in each panel).</s><s>Expression ratio was calculated as RPKM ratio of KD to control.</s><s>P values were calculated to compare the log2 fold changes in RPKM values of the two groups of genes (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test).</s><s>**: p &lt; 1e-7</s></p><p><s>populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>).</s><s>The individual-specific mean editing levels or editing indexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> were also highly similar across populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>).</s><s>A differential test revealed that only a small number of editing sites has significantly different editing levels across populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3d</ref>).</s><s>Overall, the YRI population showed the highest level of difference in RNA editing relative to other populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>In particular, YRI and GBR populations appeared to be most different among all pairwise comparisons, with the smallest overlap in editing sites and the largest number of differentially edited sites, and the largest difference in average editing levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b-d</ref>).</s><s>It should be noted that although the cross-population difference is small, this level of difference is still larger than that between individuals within the same population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Population-wide editing similarity is not explained by ADARs.</s></p><p><s>To understand the population-wise differences in RNA editing, we next examined expression levels of the ADAR genes, combining those of ADAR1 isoforms, p110 and p150.</s><s>Surprisingly, all three ADARs showed significantly different levels across populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3f</ref>), which is in stark contrast to the relatively similar average editing levels among the populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>).</s><s>Given these observations, we asked whether other RNA binding proteins (RBPs) contribute to the observed editing variability.</s><s>To this end, we examined expression levels of 507 RBPs using the RNA-Seq data from this study (requiring average RPKM level &gt; 1).</s><s>A total of 13 RBPs were significantly different in ≥4 pairwise comparisons between populations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Among these proteins, AGO2 was most significant in the CEU vs. YRI comparison.</s><s>Notably, between the CEU and YRI populations, we observed the largest difference in ADAR expression levels, but the most similar editing levels, compared with other pairs of populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, AGO2 expression was positively correlated with average editing levels (r = 0.15-0.42,</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>), similarly as for ADAR1 (r = 0.18-0.31,</s><s>Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Correlation between AGO2-miRNA targeting and editing.</s><s>We next examined the potential relationship between AGO2 and RNA editing.</s><s>As the canonical function of AGO2 is miRNAguided transcript destabilization occurring primarily in the cytoplasm, while editing presumably occurs earlier in the

ranging from being very rare to nearly 100% prevalent.</s><s>Compared to rare sites, prevalent editing sites are stronger substrates for ADAR editing and are associated with higher editing levels.</s><s>These observations hold true for all five populations included in this study.</s><s>Indeed, our analyses showed that editing profiles of the five populations are largely similar, with small differences in editing levels of specific sites.</s><s>This similarity in editing profiles strikingly contrasted the significantly different expression levels of the ADAR genes across populations.</s></p><p><s>To understand this apparent discrepancy, we conducted a series of in-depth analyses, supported by experimental validations, which led to the discovery of a new functional mechanism by which RNA editing can modulate mRNA abundance.</s><s>Our results suggest that the AGO2-miRNA complex preferentially targets and destabilizes the unedited version of mRNAs that harbor editing sites in their 3′ UTRs.</s><s>Furthermore, this differential regulation is likely mediated by a difference in RNA secondary structure caused by RNA editing.</s><s>In general, the edited copy of an mRNA has a more stable secondary structure and renders lower accessibility for miRNA targeting than the unedited copy.</s><s>It has been a challenge in the field to better understand the

that RNA editing may affect mRNA abundance through a variety of mechanisms, which calls for systematic analyses to reveal such mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>Our study revealed one such mechanism where 3′

versions of mRNAs are more prone to miRNA targeting, explaining the existence of positive correlation between mRNA abundance and RNA editing levels.</s><s>Previously, ADAR and A-to-I editing were reported to affect miRNA biogenesis through different mechanisms, including editing in primary miRNA transcripts that may alter mature miRNA sequences, editing-dependent suppression of miRNA

speculations: miRNA targeting is affected by RNA structural changes mediated by A-to-I editing rather than direct alteration of miRNA target site sequences.</s></p><p><s>It should be noted that the endogenous gene expression changes caused by RNA editing are generally small in this study, which is likely due to the relatively low level of RNA editing for most sites (editing level being 0.1-0.2)

length 1001 centered at the editing site was used as input to RNAplfold <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>Then, for each position around the editing site, the probability for accessibility of a 7mer region in the RNA structure was calculated.</s><s>This calculation was carried out for both the edited and unedited version of the 1001 nt sequence.</s><s>The relative accessibility of a 7mer was calculated as the log2 difference in accessibilities at each position in the edited and unedited sequences (with editing site defined as position 0 and the 7mer centered at a given position).</s><s>An average for each position was then taken over all editing sites considered in this analysis.</s><s>In addition, as a control, the same calculation was done for random A nucleotides.</s><s>Control random A's were chosen to satisfy all of the following: (1) not editing sites, (2) located in 3′ UTRs, and (3) located 300 to 500 nt away from editing sites.</s><s>We

considered only editing sites within genes of average expression level ≥ 0.1 and for which at least three edited and three non-edited individuals were available.</s><s>Relative accessibilities and expression ratios were averaged over miRNA target sites and genes, respectively, with the closest distance between editing site and miRNA target site falling into the same sliding window of distances (window size 10 nt, sliding by 1 nt).</s></p><p><s>The nucleotides opposite to editing sites in the folded RNA structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>) were identified in the
