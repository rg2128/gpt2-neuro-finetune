<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Fifty-four volunteers (22 ± 5 years old; 28 females) participated in the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Indiana University, Bloomington.</s><s>All subjects were in good health with no past history of psychiatric or neurological disease.</s><s>All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.</s><s>All participants gave informed written consent.</s><s>One male participant's data were excluded from the analysis because of excessive head motion (greater than one voxel size) and data from three other participants (one male, two females) were removed because of poor performance (less than 60% correct; two of the participants reported being unable to concentrate due to fatigue; the other responded only during reward trials).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personality questionnaire</head><p><s>Before the fMRI experiment, participants completed the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) scale, which assesses multiple personality characteristics related to sensitivity to reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carver and White, 1994)</ref>.</s><s>As in our recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Engelmann et al., 2009)</ref>, we employed the BAS-drive subscale, which has the highest internal reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carver and White, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jorm et al., 1998)</ref>, has been suggested to be the strongest predictor of positive affective responses to reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beaver et al., 2006)</ref>, and has been proposed to provide a clearer measure of appetitive motivation and approach behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dawe et al., 2004)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and behavioral paradigm</head><p><s>Compound scene-plus-word stimuli were employed (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>These categories were chosen because they are associated with category-related responses in visual cortex.</s><s>Specifically, scenes strongly recruit the parahippocampal gyrus, bilaterally <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Epstein et al., 1999)</ref>, whereas words robustly recruit the left fusiform gyrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Polk and Farah, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">McCandliss et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, images of houses and buildings overlaid with the words "HOUSE", "BLDNG" were used to create congruent and incongruent trials; the letter string "XXXXX" was used to create a neutral trial type.</s><s>Each trial begun with a cue indicating the motivational condition ("$00" or "$20") shown for 750 ms.</s><s>Following a 2-6 s jittered interstimulus-interval, a composite scene-plus-word target image was shown for 1000 ms.</s><s>Participants were instructed to press the index finger button to indicate that they saw a house image and the middle finger button to indicate that they saw a building image irrespective of the overlaid word (responses were always made with the right hand; the response button mapping was counterbalanced across participants).</s><s>Thus, image stimuli were task relevant and word stimuli were task irrelevant.</s><s>After 200 ms from the offset of the target, participants received visual feedback for 800 ms consisting of the total number of points won on the trial, as well as their cumulative earnings (in points) until that moment in time (so as to minimize the "cognitive load" related to keeping track of earnings).</s><s>During reward trials, participants won 2000 points per trial if they were fast and accurate in their response and they won zero points during error or slow trials.</s><s>The reaction time (RT) threshold to determine "fast" responses was set at 800 ms based on behavioral pilot data.</s><s>During noreward trials, participants won zero points irrespective of their performance.</s><s>During correct trials, points won were displayed in white color and during error trials points were displayed in blue color, thus providing performance feedback for both motivational conditions.</s><s>Finally, a 2-6 s inter-trial-interval containing a blank screen terminated the trial.</s></p><p><s>Both inter-stimulus and inter-trial intervals were selected from an exponential distribution favoring shorter intervals and helped in the estimation of separate cue-and target-related responses (see below).</s><s>Before the start of the experiment, participants were informed that they could earn 2000 points during each reward trial if performance was fast and accurate and that at the end of the experiment the points would be converted to cash, such that they could earn an additional $20 based on their performance.</s><s>At the end of the experiment, each participant's base pay ($25) was potentially increased such that for each point they earned .</s><s>01 cents (average reward-based earning: $18).</s></p><p><s>We used Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA) for the presentation of visual stimuli and responses were recorded using an MRI-compatible response box inside the scanner room.</s></p><p><s>Each participant performed 6 runs of the conflict task.</s><s>Each run consisted of 36 trials, resulting in a total of 216 trials and 36 trials per condition.</s><s>Trial order was balanced such that each trial type was preceded by the other trial types with the same frequency.</s><s>For each condition, trials were equally divided between those containing house and building scenes, and different images of houses and buildings were used during the control and reward conditions (counterbalanced across participants).</s><s>Within condition, each image was used only once during congruent, incongruent, or neutral trial types.</s><s>No scene images appeared in consecutive trials to minimize potential priming effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mayr et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, each run ended with a 10-s fixation cross allowing us to record the hemodynamic response for the final trial of the run.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional localizer</head><p><s>At the end of the main experimental runs, subjects participated in an additional functional "localizer" run during which they performed a simple one-back working memory task administered in a alternating blocked fashion and containing novel word and scene stimuli.</s><s>Five blocks were performed per condition, each with 12 trials during which a neutral word or scene (house/building) stimulus was presented for 1000 ms and followed by a 250-ms blank screen.</s><s>Blocks lasted 15 s and were separated by a 15-s rest block during which participants passively viewed a white fixation cross on the screen.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MR data acquisition</head><p><s>MR data were collected using a 3 Tesla Siemens TRIO scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil (without parallel imaging).</s><s>Each scanning session began with a high-resolution MPRAGE anatomical scan (TR = 1900 ms, TE = 4.15 ms, TI = 1100 ms, 1 mm isotropic voxels, 256 mm field of view).</s><s>Subsequently, in each functional run of the main experiment, 165 EPI volumes were acquired with a TR of 2500 and TE of 25 ms.</s><s>Each volume consisted of 44 oblique slices with a thickness of 3 mm and an in-plane resolution of 3 × 3 mm (192 mm field of view).</s><s>Slices were positioned approximately 30 degrees relative to the plane defined by the line connecting the anterior and posterior commissures.</s><s>For the final functional localizer run, 123 EPI volumes were collected with the same scanning parameters.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral data analysis</head><p><s>Mean RT data (excluding condition-specific extreme points that were situated more than 3 standard deviations from the mean; 3.4% on average) and mean accuracy data were initially analyzed using a 2 motivation (reward, no-reward) x 3 congruency (neutral, congruent, incongruent) repeated-measures ANOVA.</s><s>Additional 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVAs were evaluated to further characterize the results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General fMRI data analysis</head><p><s>Pre-processing of the data was done using tools from the AFNI software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cox, 1996)</ref> (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni).</s><s>The first 3 volumes of each functional run were discarded to account for equilibration effects.</s><s>The remaining volumes were slice-time corrected using Fourier interpolation such that all slices were realigned to the first slice to account for the timing offset between slices.</s><s>Six-parameter rigid-body motion correction within and across runs was performed using Fourier interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cox and Jesmanowicz, 1999)</ref> such that all volumes were spatially registered to the volume acquired closest in time to a particular subject's high-resolution anatomy.</s><s>To normalize the functional data to Talairach space <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Talairach and Tournoux, 1988)</ref>, initially each subject's high-resolution MPRAGE anatomical volume was spatially registered to the so-called TT_N27 template (in Talairach space) using a 12-parameter affine transformation; the same transformation was then applied to the functional data.</s><s>All volumes were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a full-width at half maximum of 6 mm (i.e., two times the voxel dimension).</s><s>Finally, the signal intensity of each voxel was scaled to a mean of 100 (on a per run basis), which allowed the interpretation of the estimated regression coefficients in terms of percent signal change.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Voxelwise analysis</head><p><s>Each participant's fMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model framework in AFNI.</s><s>There were a total of 8 experimental event types in the design matrix: no-reward and reward events during the cue phase, and neutral, congruent, and incongruent events during the target phase, separately for the no-reward and reward conditions.</s><s>In addition, both error and slow trials (in both cases pooled across reward and no-reward conditions) were treated separately from correct trials, and involved two additional regressors, one accounting for cue-related activity and another accounting for target-related activity.</s><s>No assumptions were made about the shape of the hemodynamic response function as responses were estimated via deconvolution.</s><s>The lack of shape assumption was especially pertinent given that cuerelated responses could be more or less sustained depending on brain region (and experimental condition; see below).</s><s>Responses were estimated starting from event onset to 15 s post onset using cubic spline basis functions.</s><s>This method is closely related to the use of finite impulses ("stick functions"), the commonly employed technique that can be considered the simplest form of basis expansion.</s><s>Cubic splines allow for a smoother approximation of the underlying responses, instead of the discrete approximation obtained by finite impulses.</s><s>Constant, linear, and quadratic terms were included for each run separately (as covariates of no interest) to model baseline and drifts of the MR signal.</s><s>As an index of activation, for each event type, we averaged the estimated responses at 5 and 7.5 s after stimulus onset (as determined via the spline-based estimates).</s><s>Exploratory analyses at earlier stages of data collection suggested that a similar pattern of results was obtained when the peak response was used as response index.</s><s>Finally, note that no separate estimate of the reward outcome phase was determined, given its close temporal proximity to the target phase.</s><s>In this manner, the estimates of target-related activity included contributions from the outcome phase (see supplementary text).</s><s>Note, however, that given our interest in evaluating interaction terms, the effect of the outcome phase was largely canceled out.</s><s>Specifically, because both incongruent and neutral trials during the reward condition had a reward-outcome phase, in our analyses we focused on difference scores, that is (incongruentneutral) REWARD , and contrasted this difference to (incongruent -neutral) NO-REWARD , (i.e., we evaluated the motivation by congruency interaction).</s><s>However, as our design did not allow the separation of outcome-from target-related activity, we could not rule out the possibility that some difference existed in outcome-related activity as a function of cognitive trial type (incongruent, neutral), particularly in the reward condition.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation of cue and target responses</head><p><s>Event-related designs allow the estimation of different event types when they occur in a randomized fashion.</s><s>However, the present study, by design, required a fixed order between the cue and target phases.</s><s>In comparable situations, at times, a partial-trial design is employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ollinger et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Here, instead, we randomized the delay between cue and target phases and the inter-trial interval.</s><s>Because cue-related activation may have been sustained (at least in some brain regions), sequential dependencies may not have been fully eliminated <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ruge et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>We evaluated our design in a set of computer simulations described in the supplementary text.</s><s>As described, the contamination in the estimation procedure produced by the sequential nature of our design was negligible.</s><s>In other words, target-related activity at 5 and 7.5 sec after stimulus onset was not contaminated by cuerelated responses.</s><s>These results are also consistent with the fact that the correlations between different regressors in our model were only modest, and did not exceed .37.</s><s>Critically, our main objective was to investigate a potential motivation by congruency interaction; accordingly, any spillover of motivation-related cue signals would lead to a main-effect type of contamination, and not one exhibiting an interaction pattern (note that information about congruency was not provided at the time of the cue).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group analysis</head><p><s>Whole-brain voxelwise random-effects analyses were conducted separately for the cue and target phases and were restricted to grey-matter voxels based on the FSL automated segmentation tool (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/).</s><s>For the cue phase, a paired t test was run to compare the activations between reward and no-reward conditions.</s><s>For the target phase, a separate 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA was run to probe the interaction between motivation (reward, no-reward) and interference (incongruent vs. neutral).</s><s>Given the working hypotheses of this study, when reporting interactions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), we focused on those regions that also exhibited a main effect of interference (incongruent vs. neutral pooled over reward and no-reward conditions).</s><s>Note that no bias was associated with this approach as main effects and interactions are orthogonal to each other.</s><s>Finally, all voxelwise statistical tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Genovese et al., 2002)</ref> at p &lt; .05.</s><s>Given that this method corrects only at the voxel level and not in terms of topological features such as peaks or regions of activation, we report here activations with a minimum cluster extent of 10 contiguous voxels.</s><s>As illustrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chumbley and Friston (2009)</ref>, this approach reduces the likelihood that false discovery rate correction will reveal spurious activations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between cue-and target-related activity</head><p><s>An important goal of the present study was to understand the link between cue-related responses, which were anticipated to vary as a function of reward, and target-related responses, which were anticipated to vary as a function of both congruency and reward.</s><s>Accordingly, we correlated cue-and target-related responses.</s><s>For the cue phase, we considered differential reward vs. no-reward responses.</s><s>For the target phase, we employed an interaction index that contrasted the differential response incongruent vs. neutral during the reward and no-reward conditions: [(incongruent -neutral) REWARD -(incongruentneutral) NO-REWARD ].</s><s>As outlined in the next paragraph, this interaction index was investigated in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) given this region's purported role in conflict monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Botvinick et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In the paper, we refer to this site as "medial PFC".</s></p><p><s>Given our focused hypotheses, we performed Pearson correlation analysis at the region of interest (ROI) level.</s><s>Cue-related ROIs were selected among fronto-parietal regions involved in attentional processing, namely the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), frontal eye field (FEF), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and pre-supplementary motor area/supplementary motor area (pre-SMA/SMA; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for locations).</s><s>A 5-mm radius sphere was utilized and centered on the peak voxel of the reward vs. no-reward contrast at the group level.</s><s>In a similar fashion, target-related activity was obtained from a 5-mm radius sphere centered on the peak voxel of the interaction in the medial PFC, as revealed by the 2 motivation (reward, noreward) x 2 congruency (neutral, incongruent) repeated-measures ANOVA at the group level.</s><s>Note that because this interaction-based selection criterion is orthogonal to a main effect of motivation, which was used to define the cue-related regions, no selection bias was incurred in the creation of our ROIs (as stated, no congruency information was available at the time of the cue).</s></p></div>
