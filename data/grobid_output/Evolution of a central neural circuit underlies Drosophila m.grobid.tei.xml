<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species-specific central circuit changes</head><p><s>In D. melanogaster and D. simulans males, equivalent pheromone responses at the sensory periphery

multi-plane functional imaging to visualize activated Fru+ neurons in the brain (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7ab</ref>).</s><s>While this stimulation elicited equivalent responses in the
