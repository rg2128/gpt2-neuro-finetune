neurons, which are more abundantly present in superficial cortical layers 2/3 (L2/3) than in deep layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>They have either a bipolar or multipolar

demonstration of whether these ChAT-expressing VIP interneurons release ACh.</s><s>Moreover, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the neocortex have been shown to form direct

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Fast cholinergic synaptic transmission by ChAT-VIP neurons.</s><s>Previous studies in mice have shown that activation of ChAT-VIP interneurons increases spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in layer 5 pyramidal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>However, it is unresolved whether ChAT-VIP interneurons directly innervate other neurons in the cortex.</s><s>To address this, we first expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in ChAT-VIP interneurons in the mPFC of ChAT-cre mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) and recorded from L1 interneurons since these neurons are known to reliably express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in other neocortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> .</s><s>In mouse mPFC, L1 interneurons received miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) mediated by nAChRs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>All brain slice physiology experiments in this study were done in the presence of glutamate receptor blockers (DNQX, 10 µM; AP5, 25 µM).</s><s>We made simultaneous whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of EYFP-positive ChAT-VIP neurons in L2/3 and nearby L1 interneurons in mouse mPFC (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</s><s>EYFP-positive neurons showed similar morphology, ChAT, VIP, CR, GAD expression patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>; Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) and action potential (AP) profiles (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) as was reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>First, we triggered single APs in presynaptic ChAT-VIP interneurons by short (1 ms) electrical depolarization of the membrane potential (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, n = 11).</s><s>This resulted in inward currents in postsynaptic L1 interneurons that either were fast and lasted up to 10 ms (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, top traces), or had slower kinetics and lasted over 100 ms (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, bottom traces).</s><s>The fast postsynaptic currents were fully blocked by methyllycaconitine (MLA, 100 nM), an antagonist of α7-subunit-containing nAChRs (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, grey trace, Fig. <ref type="figure">1j</ref>).</s><s>The slow postsynaptic current was fully blocked by DHßE (10 µM), an antagonist of β2subunit-containing nAChRs (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, bottom, grey trace, Fig. <ref type="figure">1j</ref>).</s><s>Postsynaptic currents occurred time-locked to presynaptic APs with onset delays of 1.26 ± 0.02 ms (average ± sem) from the peak of the AP (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>), suggesting synaptic transmission.</s><s>Postsynaptic currents showed substantial amplitude fluctuations, in line with synaptic transmission, with an average amplitude of -30 ± 15 pA (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>Synaptic transmission between ChAT-VIP and L1 interneuron was quite reliable: the majority of unitary synapses transmitted ACh at each presynaptic AP and average failure rates were 35 ± 10% (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>Single cell mRNA expression data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science database on mouse cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> shows that ChAT-VIP neurons express the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) encoded by the SLC18A3 gene (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3E</ref>).</s><s>Thus, ACh is likely released by means of vesicles from these neurons.</s></p><p><s>Next, in the same recordings, we induced APs in presynaptic ChAT-VIP neurons by activating ChR2 with brief blue-light pulses (Fig. <ref type="figure">1g</ref>).</s><s>This induced similar inward currents in postsynaptic L1 interneurons with similar current amplitudes (-39 ± 20 pA; Fig. <ref type="figure">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>) and that were blocked by the nicotinic receptor antagonists MLA and DHßE (Fig. <ref type="figure">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>The distribution of synaptic onset delays, calculated from the peak of the presynaptic AP, was significantly shorter than with electricallyinduced APs (0.68 ± 0.02 ms; Mann-Whitney test P &lt; 0.00001; Fig. <ref type="figure">1h</ref>).</s><s>This lower synaptic onset delay with optogenetic stimulation could result from more rapid activation of additional ChR2-expressing ChAT-VIP neurons in the slice that innervate the same L1 interneuron, or from direct depolarization of presynaptic terminals by blue-light-mediated ChR2 activation, or both.</s><s>Failure rates of postsynaptic current induction and postsynaptic current amplitude distribution in these recordings were similar with electrical and light-induced presynaptic AP induction (Fig. <ref type="figure">1i-k</ref>).</s><s>To test how abundant ChAT-VIP input to L1 interneurons is in mouse prefrontal cortical slices, we recorded from an additional set of 118 L1 interneurons and activated ChAT-VIP neurons with blue-light pulses.</s><s>Overall, we found that 36% of L1 interneurons received inputs from ChAT-VIP neurons (n = 42 of 118 neurons, Fig. <ref type="figure">1l</ref>) and these were all blocked by a cocktail of nicotinic AChR blockers (MLA and DHβE).</s><s>Thus, in mouse mPFC, ChAT-VIP
