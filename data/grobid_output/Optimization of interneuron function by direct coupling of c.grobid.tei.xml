Translaminar PV+ interneurons also migrate preferentially through the MZ, which suggest that this might be a general mechanism for interneurons with axon arbors spanning across multiple cortical layers.</s><s>These results suggest that interneurons are committed to distinct cell fates prior to their arrival in the cortex and reveal an unexpected degree of cell-autonomous coordination between different developmental programs during the assembly of neural circuits.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Migratory route choice varies among different classes of interneurons</head><p><s>We investigated whether migratory route preference (SVZ vs. MZ) varies during embryonic development using Vgat Cre ;RCE mice, in which all GABAergic interneurons are labeled with GFP.</s><s>Most interneurons (~75%) migrate via the SVZ and this preference remains relatively constant during development (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a-d</ref>).</s><s>We asked whether interneurons originating in different regions of the subpallium -MGE, CGE or POA -have distinct migratory route preferences.</s><s>We quantified the SVZ/MZ ratio for interneurons derived from the MGE/POA and CGE using Nkx2-1-Cre;RCE and Gad65-GFP mice, respectively.</s><s>The fraction of MGE/POA-and CGE-derived interneurons migrating through the MZ is very similar (~25%), and remains constant at different stages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1e-g,j</ref>).</s><s>These observations confirmed that migratory route choice is not determined by the place of origin of interneurons20.</s></p><p><s>We next wondered whether specific classes of interneurons prefer different migratory routes.</s><s>Because SST is the only neurochemical marker that is expressed by migrating interneurons embryonically, we analyzed the SVZ/MZ ratio for SST+ interneurons using Sst Cre ;Ai9 mice.</s></p><p><s>We found a much higher proportion of SST+ interneurons migrating through the MZ (~50%) than expected from the analysis of Nkx2-1-Cre;RCE mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">h,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were obtained using Dlx1/2 CreER mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>,i,j), a "leaky" transgenic strain that labels sparse SST+ interneurons (along with some prospective PV+ interneurons) when crossed with a reporter line in the absence of tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>)21.</s><s>These results suggested that cortical interneurons are not randomly allocated to any migratory route.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Migratory route choice is stable and cell-autonomous</head><p><s>We reasoned that if the fate of a specific class of interneurons is linked to a migratory route, then interneurons should remain in the same migratory route once they have made a choice.</s><s>To test this idea, we electroporated the MGE of embryonic day (E) 13.5 Nkx2-1-Cre mouse embryos with a plasmid conditionally encoding Kikume Green-Red, a photoconvertible green-to-red fluorescent protein22.</s><s>Forty-eight hours later, we photoconverted individual interneurons in the MZ and tracked their migratory behavior for 14 hours (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref> and Supplementary Video 1).</s><s>Most interneurons migrating through the MZ remain within this route during this period (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>), even though many should have abandoned this route during that time based on their normal migratory speed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We devised a transplantation experiment to test whether migrating interneurons are cellautonomously committed to a particular migratory route (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>).</s><s>We obtained cell suspensions by physically separating the MZ and the SVZ in E16.5 embryos.</s></p><p><s>In control experiments, we verified the efficiency of this protocol in Calb2 Cre ;Ai9 embryos, in which the first fraction obtained was enriched in Cajal-Retzius cells (tdTomato+), while fractions fourth and fifth were enriched in SVZ Tbr2+ cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s><s>We transplanted MZ or SVZ cells from Nkx2-1-Cre;Ai9 embryos into the pallial/subpallial boundary of acute slices obtained from wild type embryos (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>).</s><s>We found that migrating interneurons have a strong inclination to use the same route from which they were isolated (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2g-i</ref>), which reinforced the idea that interneurons are committed to a particular route of migration.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SST+ interneurons in the MZ and SVZ unfold distinct molecular programs</head><p><s>Migrating interneurons have identical morphology regardless of their origin or migratory route23,24.</s><s>To investigate whether SST+ cells migrating through different routes are molecularly distinct, we carried out RNAseq analyses using SST+ cells isolated from the MZ and SVZ using the method described above (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s><s>We found 81 genes to be differentially expressed (DEseq R analysis, FDR &lt; 5%) between both populations of cells, of which 24 genes are upregulated in SST+ interneurons migrating through the MZ compared to the SVZ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We wondered whether the genes enriched in either MZ or SVZ SST+ cells correspond to genes that are differentially expressed by distinct classes of interneurons in the adult cortex.</s></p><p><s>To answer this question, we took advantage of recent single cell RNAseq studies that unbiasedly identified six different groups of SST+ cells in the visual cortex of adult mice8.</s><s>We assessed mean z-scores for the 81 differentially expressed genes in different groups of adult SST+ interneurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>).</s><s>We found that genes enriched in SST+ interneurons migrating through the embryonic MZ have mean positive z-scores that mostly clustered within three main subtypes of SST+ interneurons, Cdk6+, Cbln4+, and Myh8+ cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, these genes have negative z-scores for SST+ interneurons characterized by the expression of Chodl (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, genes enriched in SST+ cells migrating through the embryonic SVZ have mean positive z-scores in Chodl+ interneurons, but negative scores in all the other five groups of SST+ interneurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>These results strongly suggested that SST+ interneurons migrating through the embryonic MZ and SVZ of the developing cortex correspond to different populations of SST+ interneurons in the adult cortex.</s></p><p><s>We also assessed mean z-scores for individual genes enriched in the MZ, and found that only 3 out of 24 genes are positively enriched in one population of SST+ interneurons, and selectively de-enriched in the other five populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, Mafb, Maf and Chl1 were found to be particularly enriched in Cbln4+ population, a gene enriched in Martinotti cells8.</s><s>In addition, we also observed that Chrna2, a specific marker of layer 5 Martinotti cells25, is highly enriched in both Cdk6+ and Myh8+ cell populations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c</ref>).</s><s>This analysis prompted us to test whether SST+ migrating through the embryonic MZ are prospective Martinotti cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Martinotti cells preferentially migrate through the MZ</head><p><s>Electrophysiological and morphological studies have shown that SST+ interneurons comprise at least two functionally distinct classes of interneurons: (i) layer 1-targeting Martinotti cells, and (ii) locally-projecting SST+ interneurons12,13,15.
