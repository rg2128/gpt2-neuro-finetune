<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Signaling Rapidly Fluctuates With Reward-Seeking and Positive Reinforcement</head><p><s>If HDB cholinergic signaling influences state-dependent basal forebrain output, we reasoned that the cholinergic reporter responses may dynamically change with behavioral states during the performance of complex, olfactory-guided, operant behaviors.</s><s>To test this, we recorded photometry signals from freely moving mice performing an olfactory-cued go/no-go discrimination task (N = 33 sessions, 6 animals) (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Mice first underwent a shaping period of 10-14 days where they learned the mechanics of the task without photometry recording.</s><s>During shaping, mice were trained to self-initiate trials by poking their nose into a port where they were presented with one of two odors.</s><s>They then learned to distinguish between the delivery of an S+ odor, which indicated the availability of a water droplet at a separate reward port, and an S-odor, which indicated that no reward was available.</s><s>A correct response to the S+ odor where a reward was obtained was considered a "Hit."</s><s>A correct response to the S-odor where a new trial was initiated without rewardseeking was considered a "Correct Reject."</s><s>An incorrect attempt to seek a reward after the S-odor was considered a "False Alarm" and an incorrect trial re-initiation after presentation of the S+ odor was considered a "Miss" (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Notably, this freely moving go/no-go task did not include punishment in response to False Alarms.</s><s>Thus, feedback during odor-association learning was limited to positive reinforcement of a water reward in Hit trials, and negative reinforcement of a 4 s timeout after false alarms.</s><s>This form of negative reinforcement is only mildly aversive, as demonstrated by a bias toward reward seeking trials (i.e., False Alarm Rate &gt; Miss Rate) in all sessions where odors were effectively learned.</s><s>Another feature of the freely moving task was that animals were required to self-initiate trials and reward seeking.</s><s>Thus, the timing of trial initiation and reward seeking was determined entirely by the mouse, and it required both active engagement with the task and locomotion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Following the shaping period, we next recorded photometric signals from the basal forebrain while mice learned to discriminate novel odor pairs.</s><s>As mice learned new odor pairs, accuracy within a block of 20 trials (calculated as (Hits + Correct Rejects)/(Total Trials)) increased.</s><s>An odor pair was considered "learned" after two consecutive trial blocks with accuracy &gt; 85% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>Once proficient at the task, mice typically learned new odor-reward associations within a single training session of 200-300 trials (Trials to learn = 104.6 ± 8.3, N = 56 sessions, 12 animals).</s><s>Using the timing of IR beam breaks at the odor port and reward port, individual trials of the go/no-go task were segmented into periods before and after trial initiation and, in the case of Hit and False Alarm trials, before and after reward seeking.</s><s>Aligning trials by initiation times, and separating them by trial type, revealed distinct temporal patterns of cholinergic signaling in each trial (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Averaging across trials showed that bidirectional changes in HDB cholinergic signaling were consistent within trial types, but distinct across trials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A notable feature of the signal specific to Hit trials was the suppression of HDB cholinergic tone following reward delivery.</s><s>The magnitude of the suppression, calculated as the area under the curve (AUC), was significantly larger in Hit trials (1.73 ± 0.33 dF * s/F) compared to Miss trials (0.42 ± 0.18 dF * s/F, p &lt; 0.05), False Alarm trials (0.42 ± 0.12 dF * s/F, p &lt; 0.001), or Correct Reject trials (0.66 ± 0.21 dF * s/F, p &lt; 0.001) across animals and odor-pairs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>At the same time, in both Hit and False Alarm trials, HDB acetylcholine rapidly increased leading up to beam breaks at the reward port.</s><s>Quantifying the slopes of the traces after odor delivery revealed that Hit trials exhibited steeper slopes (0.63 ± 0.12 dF/F/s) than Miss trials (0.23 ± 0.06 dF/F/s, p &lt; 0.01), False Alarm trials (0.44 ± 0.07 dF/F/s, p &lt; 0.05), and Correct Reject trials (0.22 ± 0.06 dF/F/s, p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>However, slopes in False Alarm trials were also significantly steeper compared to Miss (p &lt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photometry</head><p><s>To allow stimulation and recording of fluorescent transients through the same fiberoptic implant, we utilized a fiber photometry system from Doric lenses.</s><s>Two light emitting diodes (465 and 405 nm wavelength) were coupled to a filter cube by 0.48 na, 400 um core diameter fiber optic cables.</s><s>The filter cube separated excitation and emission wavelengths, directing the excitation wavelengths along a 0.48 na, 200 um core diameter fiber optic toward the mouse through a rotary connector attached to the behavior box.</s><s>Emission wavelengths were carried from the mouse to the filter cube along the same fiber, then directed to a femtowatt photodetector (Newport) through a 0.48 na, 600 um core diameter fiber optic cable.</s><s>Excitation and emission were controlled and recorded, respectively, in Doric Studio software.</s><s>Both GACh2.0 and GCaMP6M were excited at 465 to record either acetylcholine (for GACh2.0) or calcium binding (for GCaMP).</s><s>Additionally, excitation at the isosbestic point for GCaMP (405 nm) generates emission which is insensitive to calcium binding.</s><s>Thus, a photometric recording of GCaMP with excitation at 405 nm is a useful control for motion artifacts and other calcium-independent noise.</s><s>For GACh2.0, the isosbestic point is near 405 allowing it to serve as a control signal in a similar manner.</s><s>To record from the control channel (excited at 405 nm) and the experimental channel (excited at 465 nm) simultaneously, we employed a "locked-in" strategy where each LED was modulated at a different high frequency.</s><s>Emission resulting from both modes of excitation was recorded by the same photodetector and the signal was demodulated online in Doric Studio to separate the control channel form the experimental channel.</s><s>Both signals were then converted to df/f and the control channel was subtracted from the experimental channel to reduce noise.</s></p></div>
