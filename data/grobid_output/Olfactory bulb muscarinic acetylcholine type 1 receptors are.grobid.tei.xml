<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulating Release of OB ACh During Odor-Shock Pairing Strengthens Olfactory Fear Learning</head><p><s>Optogenetic OB stimulation has previously been shown to cause behavioral dishabituation of ChAT-ChR2+ but not wild-type (ChAT-ChR2-) littermates <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ogg et al., 2018)</ref>, consistent with the idea that the stimulation paradigm induces release of ACh into the OB.</s><s>Given that ACh is necessary during conditioning in order to acquire olfactory fear, we next tested whether supplemental OB ACh could augment fear learning.</s><s>In Experiment 2, we optogenetically stimulated release of OB ACh specifically during each of the six odor-shock pairings and tested behavioral freezing 24 h later (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>ChAT-ChR2+ mice displayed augmented freezing (mean freezing = 61.04%</s><s>± 5.0) during testing relative to ChAT-ChR2-mice (mean freezing = 43.9%</s><s>± 6.3; t (12) = 2.077, p = 0.030).</s><s>These results suggest that increasing OB ACh during acquisition of olfactory fear learning can enhance the strength of the learned association.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Using a combination of in vivo pharmacology and optogenetics in conjunction with olfactory fear conditioning, we investigated the role of ACh neurotransmission in olfactory fear learning.</s><s>Previous work demonstrates that systemic administration of nicotinic AChR antagonists during conditioning does not alter fear learning, while systemic administration of mAChRs during acquisition suppresses olfactory fear learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pavesi et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we aimed to determine whether mAChRs specifically in the OB are required for acquisition of olfactory fear.</s><s>The results demonstrate that acquisition, but not expression, of olfactory fear learning requires ACh neurotransmission through muscarinic receptors, specifically mAChR1, in the OB.</s><s>Importantly, direct OB antagonism of mAChRs does not alter olfactory-driven behaviors, establishing that the lack of learning is not a consequence of reversible anosmia during olfactory fear conditioning.</s><s>Finally, stimulating release of OB ACh during odor-shock pairing appears to increase the strength of fear learning.</s><s>Together, these studies provide a new role for ACh in associative olfactory fear learning; however, the exact mechanism by which mAChR activation during odor-shock pairing allows for acquisition of fear learning remains unknown.</s></p><p><s>Our findings confirm previous reports that mAChRs are inextricably linked to olfactory learning.</s><s>Both genetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chan et al., 2017)</ref> and pharmacological inhibition of mAChRs suppresses olfactory appetitive and aversive learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ravel et al., 1994;</ref><ref

target="#b54">Silva et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This, combined with the present results, suggests that mAChRs play a similar role in acquisition of appetitive and aversive learning.</s><s>We expand on these previous reports by demonstrating direct OB ACh signaling, specifically through mAChR1, is required during olfactory fear conditioning; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.</s><s>One possibility is that the concentration of the mAChR1 antagonist (PIR) used (1 mM) is too high to exert a specific effect on m1 receptors and may be acting as an inverse agonist of m2 receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Daeffler et al., 1999)</ref>; however, we find no effect of antagonizing mAChR2 receptors on learning at the same concentration.</s><s>This suggests that even if PIR is modulating both mAChR1 and mAChR2 receptors at this concentration, the observed effect is specific to antagonism of mAChR1 receptors.</s><s>ACh is known to modulate several OB cell types including MCs, granule cells (GCs), and periglomerular cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nickell and Shipley, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ravel et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Castillo et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pressler et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chaudhury et al., 2009)</ref>, but studies suggest that activation of mAChRs, especially mAChR1, increases excitability of GCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pressler et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Smith and Araneda, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Smith et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Given olfactory learning is impeded when antagonism of mAChRs is confined to the GC layer but not affected when antagonism is confined to the glomerular layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ravel et al., 1994)</ref>, mAChRs most likely modulate the MC/GC circuit, which increases synchronization of MC spike timing and oscillatory power <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Li and Cleland, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Models including pharmacological blockade of mAChRs in the OB result in altered OB network dynamics, which, in turn, decreases the activation of PCx, cortical plasticity, and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Devore et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>This may suggest the role of mAChRs during learning is to regulate olfactory input to PCx to enable olfactory learning.</s><s>If this is the main function of mAChRs, muscarinic signaling in the OB is also likely required for appetitive learning, which future studies should investigate.</s><s>While the exact downstream mechanisms are yet to be determined, activation of OB mAChRs in olfactory aversive learning likely regulates OB output, which ultimately leads to olfactory learning.</s><s>Interestingly, our findings replicate previous reports that ACh modulation primarily affects acquisition but has little to no effect on expression of previous olfactory learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Saar et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chapuis and Wilson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Linster and Cleland, 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We also demonstrate that stimulating release of OB ACh during odor-shock pairing appears to increase the strength of fear learning.</s><s>Optogenetic stimulation of OB ACh release cannot determine whether the facilitated learning is an effect of signaling through nicotinic AChRs, mAChRs, or both, and future studies are needed to determine the extent to which these different AChRs and their subtypes contribute to enhancement of olfactory fear learning.</s><s>However, several previous reports establish that ACh release into the OB and subsequent activation of AChRs can modulate excitability of OB glomeruli and OB output cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chaudhury et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Devore et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ma and Luo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rothermel et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bendahmane et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Enhanced synchrony and strengthened OB output could explain how optogenetically increasing OB ACh during odor-shock pairing results in strengthened olfactory learning.</s><s>This idea is in line with previous reports that high ACh facilitates learning by enabling long term potentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Linster and Cleland, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Another possibility is that OB ACh reduces the inhibitory drive of OB GCs, which could facilitate transmission of olfactory information from OB output neurons to higher processing centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Elaagouby et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kay and Beshel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kay, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Osinski et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Altering inhibitory drive of GCs could also lead to decreased inhibition of neighboring GCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Castillo et al., 1999)</ref> thereby sharpening the receptive fields of OB output cells.</s><s>It is also likely that activation of AChRs could inhibit glomerular layer inhibitory interneurons neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Crespo et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pignatelli and Belluzzi, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>, leading to increased responses of excitatory cells.</s><s>It is also possible that optogenetically stimulating cholinergic axons in the OB might produce back-propagation of action potentials to cholinergic soma, which could cause ACh release in multiple brain regions.</s><s>Therefore, it is possible the facilitated learning following stimulated OB ACh release is actually due to non-specific ACh release.</s><s>However, a recent study traced projections of basal forebrain cholinergic cells and found minimal cholinergic cells projecting to the main OB that also project to another region of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Li et al., 2018)</ref>, suggesting non-specific release is an unlikely explanation for the facilitated learning.</s><s>Future electrophysiological experiments are needed to understand the exact role of ACh in facilitating olfactory aversive learning.</s></p><p><s>In summary, this study reveals new insights into the role of ACh in olfactory associative aversive learning.</s><s>Previous reports using systemic antagonists indicated mAChRs, but not nicotinic AChRs, are required during odor-shock pairing for olfactory learning to take place.</s><s>However, this did not address whether ACh signaling through mAChRs is required in the OB nor the extent to which olfactory aversive learning is mediated by specific mAChR subtypes.</s><s>Using OB infusion of mAChR antagonists, we were able to determine that activation of mAChRs, specifically the m1 subtype, is required directly in the OB during odor-shock pairing for acquisition of olfactory fear learning.</s><s>Additionally, we were able to confirm previous reports that blockade of mAChRs does not interfere with expression of previously learned olfactory fear.</s><s>Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of OB ACh during odor-shock pairing appears to increase the strength of olfactory learning.</s><s>Together these studies demonstrate the importance of OB ACh for olfactory learning and related plasticity.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
