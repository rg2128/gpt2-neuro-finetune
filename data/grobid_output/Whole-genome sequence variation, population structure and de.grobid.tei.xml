<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Although the human genome reference sequence provides a common scaffold for the annotation of genes, regulatory elements and other functional units, it does not contain information about how individuals differ in their DNA sequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Fueled by the commercial development of microarrays for efficient SNP genotyping and collaborative projects in large samples, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided a systematic approach to test genetic variants for a role in disease.</s><s>To date, GWAS have reproducibly identified thousands of genomic loci, providing insight into underlying pathways of disease, in some cases with translational and clinical impact. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> The characterization of rare variation poses a major challenge.</s><s>Since rare alleles have emerged, on average, relatively recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> they show much greater geographic clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and are more susceptible to population stratification compared to common variation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>It is therefore imperative to study large samples across multiple populations, even within continental groups, to build a relatively complete catalog of rare variation in the human genome.</s></p><p><s>We initiated the Genome of the Netherlands ("GoNL") Project to characterize DNA sequence variation-common and rare-for SNVs, short insertions and deletions (indels) and larger deletions in 769 individuals of Dutch ancestry selected from five biobanks under the auspices of the Dutch hub of the Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-NL). <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Specifically, we sampled 231 trios, 11 quartets with monozygotic twins, and 8 quartets with dizygotic twins, from 11 of the 12 provinces of the Netherlands without ascertaining on phenotype or disease.</s><s>(The twelfth province, Flevoland, was excluded from sampling as it was established by land reclamation in the 20 th century.)</s><s>By whole-genome sequencing these 250 families at ~13x coverage, our aim was to build a resource of 1,000 haploid genomes as representative for a small (41,543 km 2 ) but densely populated country (&gt; 17 million inhabitants) in northwestern Europe (Supplementary Note).</s></p><p><s>Here, we provide the first detailed analysis of the GoNL data set after data processing and quality control (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Note).</s><s>To maximize sensitivity, we analyzed all samples jointly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and discovered 20.4 million biallelic SNVs, 1.2 million biallelic indels (&lt; 20 bp) and 27,500 larger deletions (&gt; 20 bp).</s><s>Of the SNVs, 6.2 million are common (MAF &gt; 5%), 4.0 million are low-frequency (MAF 0.5-5%), and 10.2 million are rare (MAF &lt; 0.5%).</s><s>Based on coverage and mapping metrics, we estimate that 94.1% of the genome could be called reliably (the "accessible" genome) within which 99.2% of SNVs of 1% frequency should be detectable (Supplementary Note).</s><s>Indeed, we discovered 18.9M SNVs and 1.1M indels in the accessible, autosomal genome (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Indels and large deletions were based on conservative consensus calls from several complementary methods that use information about mapped reads, read depth, read pair, split reads and de novo assembly (Supplementary Note).</s><s>We used MVNcall for trio-aware phasing and linkage disequilibrium-based imputation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> starting from the genotype likelihoods of SNVs and indels, which yielded a fully phased panel of 998 unique haplotypes after QC.</s><s>The nonreference genotype concordance for SNVs was 99.4% (compared to genotypes from Complete Genomics sequencing data in 20 overlapping samples) and 99.5% (compared to Illumina Immunochip genotypes collected in all GoNL samples).</s><s>The average coverage of 13.3x coupled with the family-based design allowed us to construct a high-quality whole-genome data set for further analysis, including characterization of structural variation, detection of de novo events, imputation, and demographic inference.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Novel variation in GoNL</head><p><s>To determine the number of novel variants, we investigated the overlap between GoNL and existing databases.</s><s>We rediscovered almost all sites (98.2%) in the European sample (CEU) of HapMap Phase 2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and 71.1% of sites in the European subset of the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 (1KG-EUR), <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> consistent with the expectation that commonly segregating alleles across European populations should also be detected in GoNL (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, only 39.0% of SNVs observed in GoNL at 0.5% frequency or below (but excluding singletons) were observed in 1KG-EUR, highlighting the value of studying individual populations in greater depth.</s><s>The contribution of 7.6 million novel SNVs in GoNL represents a 14.6% increase of dbSNP (build 137), although the majority (75.6%) of these novel variants are singletons.</s><s>Considering that 16.5% of 2.0 million singletons in 1KG-EUR were also observed in GoNL, we expect that a substantial number of the novel GoNL singletons will be encountered again as we continue to sequence larger samples within the Netherlands and across Europe.</s></p><p><s>Structural variation could be called confidently across a broad size range, from large deletions to short insertions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>The overall shape of the size spectrum shows that larger structural events are less frequent than smaller indels, presumably reflecting their relative deleterious nature.</s><s>We recognized specific peaks in the size spectrum that correspond to microsatellite instability (MSI) around 4 bp, short interspersed elements (SINEs) at 300 bp, and long interspersed elements (LINEs) at 6 kb.</s><s>In general, we detected a large number of novel deletions throughout the size spectrum.</s><s>In comparison to 1KG Phase 1, 54.4% of the indels (&lt; 20 bp) and 93.3% of the larger deletions (&gt; 20 bp) are novel (Supplementary Note).</s><s>Taking advantage of the medium coverage data and using especially tuned methods (PINDEL, CLEVER), our analysis fills an important gap for the discovery of mid-size deletions (30-500 bp) where essentially all (98.4%) of the observed variants are novel.</s><s>The novelty rate for deletions larger than 500 bp is still substantial (66.3%).</s><s>We note that most of the deletions reported here are biased to be common because stringent filtering required variants to be present in at least three families and transmitted to at least one offspring.</s><s>This strategy allowed us to generate a specific call set with an overall validation rate of 96.5% (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</s><s>A more sensitive and complete data set including duplications, inversions, mobile element insertions, and translocations is currently being assembled and validated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional variation</head><p><s>Predicting the biological consequences of functional variants within a single genome is still an unresolved challenge with important implications for using nextgeneration sequencing in a clinical setting.</s><s>To characterize the burden of loss-of-function (LoF) variants in detail, we classified all such variants in GoNL according to LoF definitions described by MacArthur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>and applied various filters to remove potential annotation errors (Supplementary Note).</s><s>Amongst rare variants, we observed an excess of probably or possibly damaging missense variants (according to PolyPhen-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> ), nonsense variants, and frameshift indels, consistent with a model in which such functional variants are subject to purifying selection (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>Of the larger deletions, we counted 66 LoF deletions that eliminate the first exon of a gene or more than half of its coding sequence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and found evidence they were depleted relative to all deletions (p = 0.005 for 20-100 bp; p = 2.6 x 10 -9 for &gt; 100 bp).</s><s>This effect was amplified when considering only genes listed in the OMIM compendium (p = 2.4 x 10 -27 ), illustrating a strong selective force against large structural changes in key genes.</s></p><p><s>The overall patterns and per-individual distributions of LoF SNVs (premature stops or variants interrupting a splice site) and missense variants are consistent with those found in 1KG (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>On average, an individual carries 60 LoF SNVs, 69 LoF frameshift indels, and 15 LoF large deletions.</s><s>The bulk of these LoF mutations per individual are common (&gt;5% frequency in the population), suggesting that these variants are not subject to strong selective pressure and, though they are proteintruncating mutations, are likely phenotypically benign.</s><s>This emphasizes the need for caution in assigning pathogenicity to variants purely on the basis of their predicted impact on protein structure.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, when we considered only rare LoF variants, those more likely to be pathogenic, we found that the average individual in GoNL carries 4 nonsense variants, 2 variants interrupting a splice site, and 2 frameshift indels.</s><s>By comparing these numbers to synonymous variants (which provides a baseline expectation under neutrality), we estimate that each individual carries an excess of 4-5 rare LoF SNVs (Supplementary Note), which are sufficiently deleterious that they will never reach high frequency in the population at large.</s></p><p><s>We also investigated the number of compound heterozygotes of rare LoF SNVs, short indels and large deletions.</s><s>Across all genes in the genome, we observed three compound heterozygous events mapping to three genes in three separate individuals (average 0.01 compound heterozygous events per individual).</s><s>The phenotypic impact of compound heterozygotes of rare LoF mutations demands further characterization and should be considered explicitly in rare variant studies.</s></p><p><s>Whereas compound heterozygotes of rare LoF variants are sparse, we expected compound heterozygotes of common LoF variants to be more prevalent assuming these variants are less likely to be deleterious.</s><s>Indeed, we found that the average number of common-LoF compound heterozygotes per individual increased to 2.89 (range: 0-7).</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, while overall there are 1,917 common-LoF compound heterozygous events across all GoNL samples, these are confined to only 11 genes (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3a</ref>).</s><s>All but one of these genes appear to have extreme Residual Variation Intolerance Scores (all &gt;84 th percentile across 16,956 genes), which is unlikely to occur by chance (p = 1.41 x 10 -5 , Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>This suggests that these genes are more tolerant of disruptive mutations.</s></p><p><s>Because disease mutation databases are often employed to identify potential variants of interest, we annotated variants in GoNL listed as disease-causing
