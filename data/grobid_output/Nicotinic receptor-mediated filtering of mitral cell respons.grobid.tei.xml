increase would result in increased MC firing that might set up a template upon which odorant signals impinge.</s><s>Although the information car- ried by this template is yet unknown, the increased firing might serve to set detection thresholds and act as a filter for incoming odor inputs wherein small increases in spike frequency upon ON stimulation might not be detected over the basal firing.</s><s>Although counterintuitive, the increase in MC spiking by nAChR activation could therefore act to decrease noise in the OB circuit by suppressing weak ON inputs.</s><s>In addition, this template makes it possible for MCs to be inhibited by odor onset (such as via lateral inhibition), thus increasing possible coding mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesize that nicotinic filtering of
