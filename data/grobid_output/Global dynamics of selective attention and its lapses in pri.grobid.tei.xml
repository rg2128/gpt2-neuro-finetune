<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>For the present study, we analyzed neuroelectric data recorded in 36 A1 sites of 2 macaque monkeys (20 sites in subject KI and 16 in subject AB).</s><s>Neuronal activity was recorded with linear array multielectrodes, which spanned all cortical layers.</s><s>In all experiments, data were obtained via simultaneous left and right hemisphere A1 recordings targeting regions tuned to similar frequencies.</s><s>To minimize the effects of volume conduction, and attempt to define local transmembrane currents, we calculated one dimensional current source density (CSD) from the field potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> and carried out our analyses on the CSD signals and multi-and single unit activity (MUA and SUA respectively).</s></p><p><s>During recordings, subjects performed a selective intermodal attention task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>In separate blocks, the monkeys either had to attend to a rhythmic stream of auditory tone beeps and detect deviant tones (targets) that differed in their frequency, while ignoring the simultaneously presented visual stimulus stream, or vice versa: they had to attend to rhythmically presented LED light flashes and detect deviant flashes (targets) that differed from standards either in color or intensity, while ignoring auditory stimuli.</s><s>Subjects were instructed to attend to a given modality with the use of a cueing block that preceded selective attention trial blocks and consisted only of the to be attended to modality stimuli.</s><s>During the presentation of the selective attention trial blocks (lasting 187-239 seconds and containing 32 -46 targets) 80% of targets were paired with a juice reward, which subjects could collect by sticking out their tongue.</s><s>On 20% of targets, the juice reward was randomly omitted.</s><s>These trials were used to monitor performance: a hit was detected if the subjects licked on the juiceless targets, while false alarm was defined as a behavioral response to deviants of the to be ignored modality.</s><s>Hit and false alarm rates of the two subjects were significantly different in both attend auditory and attend visual trial blocks (Fig 1b), indicating that cueing had a strong effect on behavior.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ensemble oscillatory characteristics of attention and its lapses</head><p><s>As we outlined in the Introduction, the first goal of our study was to generate a timeresolved measure for the strength of entrainment, to determine whether it can be used to index attention.</s><s>To do this, we first determined the cortical layers for each of our recording sites using CSD response profiles related to best frequency (BF) tones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and selected the supragranular channel with the largest amplitude sink (red blob in color map) for intertrial coherence (ITC) analyses, since previous studies pinpoint this laminar location as the site of strongest oscillatory entrainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s><s>Albeit BF tone related CSD profiles were used to determine laminar electrode locations, for our further analyses we selected artifact free recordings during which non-best frequency (non-BF) tones constituted the auditory stream, with frequencies at least 2 octaves different from the BF of the recording site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a inset</ref>).</s><s>The reason for this is that responses to non-BF tones are subthreshold in nature, without significant stimulus related MUA or CSD amplitude increases (evoked response), that could distort phase/ITC estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> , which are used to index entrainment.</s><s>Next, we extracted the phases of the supragranular delta oscillation that corresponded to the repetition rate of stimuli (auditory = 1.6 and visual = 1.8 Hz) at stimulus onset in 5 second windows and calculated ITC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>The step size of the moving window was 1 second (resulting in a 1 Hz "sampling rate").</s><s>Significant ITC values related to either modality stimuli indicate that delta oscillations in a given time window are "locked" to or entrained by the stimuli, while non-significant ITC values signal that the phase of oscillations is random at the time stimuli are presented due to a lack of oscillatory entrainment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> illustrates, the moving ITC measure fluctuates strongly, both when calculated for auditory (green trace) and for simultaneously presented visual stimuli (purple trace), independent of whether the monkey is cued to attend to auditory (upper) or to visual stimuli (lower).</s><s>Based on the significance of auditory and visual related moving ITC, four "entrainment categories" can be distinguished: 1) significant auditory stimulus related delta ITC (ITCa) indicating auditory entrainment, 2) significant visual stimulus related delta ITC (ITCv) signaling visual entrainment, 3) no significant ITC (noITC) and 4) significant ITC related to both streams (ITC both).</s><s>As the boxplots in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> demonstrate, similar to behavior, cueing also had a significant effect on entrainment.</s><s>In attend auditory trial blocks, auditory ITC periods occur significantly more often than any other entrainment categories, and likewise visual ITC dominates in attend visual trial blocks.</s><s>The occurrence of periods marked by entrainment to the to be ignored (or un-cued) modality and no-entrainment did not differ significantly.</s><s>Periods in which both auditory and visual ITC were significant (ITC both) occurred significantly less than any other entrainment category, and sometimes not at all in a trial block (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-b</ref>).</s><s>In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> , these results indicate that, at least in A1, entrainment is exclusive: only one stimulus stream entrains oscillations at any given time.</s><s>Therefore, we excluded rare time-windows when ITC was significant for both stimulus streams from further analyses.</s></p><p><s>To verify our initial hypothesis that oscillatory entrainment -measured as significant ITCcan be used as an indicator of selective attention, we examined the distribution of hits and false alarms during the different entrainment categories.</s><s>As the bar plots in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> illustrate, nearly all hits occurred during periods of entrainment to the cued modality (82.9% in attend auditory and 83.4% in attend visual trial blocks), while nearly all false alarms occurred during periods of entrainment to the un-cued modality (87.1% in attend auditory and 76.1% in attend visual trial blocks).</s><s>This indicates that the "modality of entrainment" is indeed a good indicator for the modality the subjects are selectively attending to.</s><s>Both entrainment and behavioral measures indicate that while cueing successfully biased the monkey's attention towards the desired modality stimuli, at times, the subjects were switching their attention to the un-cued (to be ignored) modality.</s><s>During periods of no entrainment, the monkeys had significantly less hits compared to entrainment to the cued, and significantly less false alarms compared to entrainment to the un-cued modality streams(Fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> bar plots), indicative of attentional lapses.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, these results provide solid support for our hypothesis that oscillatory entrainment can be used to index the modality and strength of selective attention, and that differing entrainment patterns outline distinct brain states: one indicative of selective attention to the auditory stream (ITCa), one of selective attention to the visual stream (ITCv), and a third state of attentional lapse (noITC).</s><s>In an attempt to reveal mechanistic information, we investigated how neuronal oscillatory dynamics differ across these three attentional states.</s><s>We started by comparing supragranular auditory stimulus related ITC, and power spectra averaged across all layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>As expected, and as the upper row of time frequency and p-value plots in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref> illustrate, auditory stimulus related ITC is greater at certain frequencies during auditory entrainment, independent of cueing context.</s><s>One of these frequencies is delta, since significant delta ITC was used to define auditory entrainment.</s><s>Other frequencies correspond to theta and gamma oscillations, which have been shown to be dominant in the spectrum of ongoing supragranular neuronal ensemble activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</s><s>This is also not surprising since the phase reset of ongoing oscillations, indexed by ITC, is a prerequisite for entrainment, and prior studies have found that phase reset in the theta and gamma frequency bands accompanies delta reset and entrainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</s><s>A two-way ANOVA carried out on ITC values averaged within the different frequency bands in the 20-100 ms post-stimulus time-frame verified these findings: while the effect of entrainment (ITCa, ITCv or no-ITC) was significant for delta (F(2,210)=146.95,</s><s>p=1.22×10 -40 ), theta (F(2,210)=3.95,</s><s>p=0.02) and gamma oscillations (F(2,210)=5.18,</s><s>p=0.006), the effect of cueing (attend auditory vs. attend visual) was not significant in any of the frequency bands (F delta (1,210)  (1,210)=3.13,</s><s>p gamma =0.07).</s><s>There was no interaction of entrainment and cueing (F delta (2,210)=0.1,</s><s>p delta =0.90; F theta (2,210)=0.69,</s><s>p theta =0.5; F alpha (2,210)=0.1,</s><s>p alpha =0.9; F beta (2,210)=0.06,</s><s>p beta =0.93; F gamma (2,210)=0.04,</s><s>p gamma =0.96).</s><s>These results verify and extend previous observations that selective attention to a given modality is indexed by the phase reset of oscillations in the delta, theta and gamma frequency bands, while ignoring stimuli (attention to a different modality) and attentional lapses are both characterized by a lack of phase reset.</s></p><p><s>Next, we compared oscillatory amplitudes and found that similar to ITC, cueing had no effect (two-way ANOVA, F delta (1,210)=0.22,</s><s>p delta =0.63; F theta (1,210)=0.13,</s><s>p theta =0.71; F alpha (1,210)=0.02,</s><s>p alpha =0.88; F beta (1,210)=0.0008,</s><s>p beta =0.97; F gamma (1,210)=0.01,</s><s>p gamma =0.9).</s><s>These results suggest that the quality of the three distinct attentional states does not differ in the 2 different cueing contexts, cueing merely increases the length of one of these -attention to the cued modality stimuli (see above).</s><s>As opposed to the effect of cueing, comparing amplitude values across the different frequency bands revealed that entrainment had a significant effect on amplitudes in the alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands (F alpha (2,210)=20.86,</s><s>p alpha = 6.6× -08 ; Fbeta(2,210)=10.95,</s><s>p beta =1.2×10 -04 ; F gamma (2,210)=11.73,</s><s>p gamma =2.7×10 -05 ).</s><s>As the lower row of time frequency and p-value plots in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref> illustrates, in contrast to ITC measures, there appear to be no amplitude differences between auditory (ITCa) vs. visual entrainment conditions (ITCv).</s><s>Rather, alpha, beta and gamma amplitudes are greater during periods that lack entrainment (noITC).</s><s>To estimate the laminar location of these amplitude differences, we aligned laminar spectral amplitude profiles across all experiments (see methods) and statistically compared amplitude differences during entrainment vs. no-entrainment periods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>Since we found no effect of cueing on any spectral measures across the three different entrainment conditions (as described above), we merged the data recorded in attend auditory and attend visual trial blocks.</s><s>We found that increased alpha-beta-gamma amplitudes during no entrainment time periods were widespread across the different cortical layers.</s><s>Our layer specific amplitude maps also revealed an opposite sign change in delta amplitude at the frequency of auditory (ITCa vs. noITC) and visual stimulus repetition rate (ITCv vs. noITC), but only in the supragranular layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>This latter finding in the supragranular layers can be explained by the presence of greater delta energy at the frequency of entrainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> , therefore, in the following we will only focus on the alpha-beta-gamma effect.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Slow counterphase oscillatory dynamics</head><p><s>Our results thus far show that alpha amplitude across all cortical layers is increased during periods that lack entrainment to stimulus streams.</s><s>Therefore, it is not surprising that by overlaying moving delta ITC and alpha amplitude, we find an opposite sign modulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>): whenever delta ITC is high, alpha amplitude is low and vice versa.</s><s>What is surprising is that this counter-sign modulation appears to be rather rhythmic throughout the entire trial block, and that it seems slower than the rhythm of the task (defined as the average frequency of target stimulus occurrence (0.16 Hz).</s><s>To quantify these observations, we first calculated the spectra of moving delta ITC and alpha waveforms.</s><s>As the examples in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref> illustrate, both ITC and alpha spectra exhibit prominent peaks around 0.06 Hz, and the ITC spectra display a second peak around 0.15 Hz.</s><s>This second peak was often absent from the moving alpha amplitude spectra.</s><s>As the boxplots of the pooled data show (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>), the prominent lower frequency peaks in moving ITC and alpha amplitude spectra were not significantly different from each other when pooled across all experiments (n=36, Wilcoxon signed rank, p=0.</s><s>19), but both were significantly different from the task frequency ( n=36, Wilcoxon signed rank, p ITC =3.64×10 -07 , p alpha =3.99×10 -07 ).</s><s>The higher frequency peak detectable in the delta ITC spectrum was, on the other hand, not significantly different from the task frequency (n=36, Wilcoxon signed rank, p=0.072).</s><s>These results indicate that the most prominent fluctuation of attention, indexed by opposing modulation of entrainment and alpha amplitude, is independent of the task structure.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether the time-courses of moving ITC and alpha amplitude waveforms are anti-correlated as their opposite sign modulation suggests, we measured the amount of bias in the distribution of their phase differences (coherence) at the frequency of the dominant peak in the alpha amplitude spectrum.</s><s>We found significant coherence (Rayleigh p&lt;0.05) of moving ITC and moving alpha amplitude waveforms in 33 out of 36 experiments.</s><s>As the histogram in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref> shows, mean phase differences (ITC vs. alpha) are significantly biased towards a half oscillatory cycle, which verifies the anti-correlated delta ITC-alpha amplitude relationship.</s></p><p><s>To test whether moving ITC and alpha reflect local or more global long timescale fluctuations of neuronal dynamics, we calculated the coherence of moving ITC and alpha amplitude waveforms in simultaneous left and right hemisphere recordings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>).</s><s>We found that all but one paired recordings displayed coherent (Rayleigh p&lt;0.05) interhemispheric delta ITC and alpha amplitude fluctuations, with mean phase difference distributions significantly biased towards zero.</s><s>This signals that both delta ITC and alpha amplitude are modulated synchronously across hemispheres, indicative of the involvement of large scale networks rather than local neuronal ensemble mechanisms in the orchestration of anti-correlated entrainment-alpha amplitude fluctuation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distinct delta-theta versus alpha-beta referenced operational modes</head><p><s>As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref> shows, besides alpha, the amplitude of beta and gamma oscillations also increased during periods of attentional lapses, when delta oscillations were not entrained by any of the sensory stimulus streams.</s><s>The observation of increased beta amplitudes during no-entrainment periods characterized by high amplitude alpha oscillatory activity is in line with previous findings indicating that alpha and beta

rather than being continuous, gamma band neuronal activity occurs in bursts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> , we decided to examine the properties of gamma bursting during entrainment (significant ITC) vs. no-entrainment (non-significant ITC) periods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>We first tested the peak frequency of gamma bursts in distinct cortical layers, and found no effect of entrainment across trial blocks (n=72, Wilcoxon signed rank, p supragranular =0.6, p granular =0.38, p infragranular =0.93).</s><s>In contrast, we found a significant increase in the amplitude of gamma bursts during no-entrainment time periods in the granular layer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, we found that the rate at which gamma bursts occurred was significantly increased across all layers during no-entrainment time periods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref>), which -together with the burst amplitude increase in the granular layercould account for the gamma amplitude increase observed in the averaged laminar profiles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The distinction between the amplitude and rate of gamma bursting is important since the gamma amplitude differences observed in the time-averaged data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>) do not have to be directly related to changes in gamma amplitude per se, but rather could be due to the restructuring of gamma bursts.</s><s>Therefore, we examined whether increased gamma rates could be associated with changes in cross frequency coupling by measuring how the timing of gamma bursts correlates with the phase of neuronal ensemble activity at lower frequencies.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref> shows averaged burst-CSD coherence spectra from the supragranular, granular and infragranular layers.</s><s>Higher values indicate stronger gamma-burst -CSD coupling at a given frequency.</s><s>We found stunning opposite sign differences in gamma burst-theta phase and gamma burst-alpha phase coupling.</s><s>While during periods of entrainment, theta-gamma and to a lesser degree delta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling dominate, especially in the supragranular layers, during no-entrainment periods alpha-gamma coupling takes over in all cortical layers.</s><s>Thus, phase amplitude coupling undergoes radical changes during switches between delta entrainment and high alpha dominated brain states.</s></p><p><s>Since gamma frequency neuronal activity and multiunit activity usually display correlated amplitude changes, we tested whether, similar to gamma, MUA is also increased during noentrainment time periods.</s><s>We found that indeed, MUA of all cortical layers was significantly greater during no-entrainment periods (n=72, Wilcoxon signed rank, p supragranular =0.0264, p granular =0.0043, p infragranular =0.0019), which is again a counterintuitive finding in light of the commonly accepted suppressive role of alpha oscillatory activity.</s><s>Therefore, we decided to further dissect the MUA amplitude effect by characterizing single unit firing properties during entrainment and no-entrainment periods.</s></p><p><s>Altogether, 1167 single units were isolated from the 36 A1 multielectrode recordings.</s><s>Below the averaged

neurons respectively.</s><s>While short duration waveforms (SDWs) are not often isolated, a recent study suggests that these might reflect afferent spiking activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .We arbitrarily assigned parts of the distribution to these categories, acknowledging that there is likely considerable overlap between the groups with different spike durations.</s><s>Nevertheless, in line with the literature, median spike rates were significantly higher in the putative inhibitory neuron group compared to both other groups (n inhibitory =589, n excitatory =490, n SDW =88, Wilcoxon rank sum, p inhibitory-excitatory =2.33×10 -4 , p inhibitory-SDW = 4.09×10 <ref type="bibr">-11</ref> ). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref> shows firing rates during entrainment (significant ITC) versus no-entrainment (non-significant ITC) periods for all neurons, and separately for the different putative cell types.</s><s>We found that all neuronal groups displayed significantly increased firing rates during no-entrainment periods.</s><s>This corroborates our MUA result and raises the question: similar to the case of gamma bursts, do increased firing rates reflect distinct spike-CSD coherence patterns?</s><s>The pooled data displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref> indicates that this is indeed the case.</s><s>If we consider all neurons, deltatheta spike-CSD coherence is greater during entrainment, while alpha-beta spike-CSD coherence dominates no-entrainment periods.</s><s>Whereas across different brain states deltatheta-alpha effects dominate in putative excitatory neurons, alpha-beta spike-CSD coherence changes dominate in putative inhibitory interneurons.</s><s>We found neither distinct spike-CSD coherence patterns nor any entrainment related changes in the case of SDWs.</s><s>These results indicate that in general, the firing of A1 neurons is structured dominantly by delta-theta oscillatory activity during selective attention to rhythmic external stimuli, and to alpha-beta oscillatory activity during lapses of attention.</s></p><p><s>The repetitive combination technique used when calculating spike-CSD coherences enabled us to detect significant differences of spike-CSD coherence between entrainment and noentrainment periods for every single unit (see Methods).</s><s>We found that 24% of all units displayed a significant delta-theta spike CSD coherence increase during entrainment, 25% displayed a significant alpha-beta spike CSD coherence increase during no-entrainment periods, and 9% displayed both (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d</ref>).</s><s>If spike-CSD coherence indicates how strongly a given neuron is integrated in synchronous neuronal ensemble operations orchestrated by neuronal oscillations, this result might mean that while certain neurons are recruited during attentive brain states, others are utilized more during attentional lapses, with a proportion being able to switch between operational modes.</s></p><p><s>Besides calculating "local" spike-CSD coherences, we can also calculate the laminar spike-CSD profile of any single neuron, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6e</ref>.</s><s>These profiles reveal strikingly different coherence patterns during entrainment (top) vs. no-entrainment (bottom) periods, and not just in frequency, but also in cortical space.</s><s>Therefore, we decided to investigate the laminar coherence patterns that characterize entrainment vs. no-entrainment brain states, since these likely reflect differing functional connectivity patterns that funnel the effect of neuronal spiking towards differing neuronal computations.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref> shows representative laminar coherence matrices displaying delta (on top) and alpha (on bottom) CSD coherence across all electrode pairs during periods of entrainment (significant ITC, left) vs. no-entrainment (non-significant ITC, right).</s><s>It is apparent that, while the networks delineated by delta and alpha coherence patterns overlap, they also show distinct characteristics.</s><s>Delta coherence is strongest within and across supra and infragranular sites, while alpha coherence highlights interconnected nodes within all cortical layers.</s><s>The differences between entrainment and no-entrainment conditions might not be obvious from the coherence matrices, so we averaged coherence values along one spatial dimension, creating a one-dimensional laminar coherence index (traces to the right of the coherence matrices in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>).</s><s>This index describes for each recording location (y axis), how strongly neuronal activity is coherent with neuronal activity at all other locations (xaxis).</s><s>As the representative example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref> shows, there are significant counter-sign differences in delta and alpha cross-laminar coherence between entrainment and noentrainment brain states.</s><s>While supragranular and infragranular delta coherence is increased during entrainment, alpha coherence across all layers is increased during no-entrainment periods.</s><s>Interestingly, while in the majority of individual laminar coherence profiles, like in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>, delta coherence differences were not significant in the granular layer, the difference was significant in the pooled data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>).</s><s>To summarize, while interlaminar functional delta coherence is stronger during attention to rhythmic stimulus streams, alpha coherence across cortical layers is stronger during lapses of attention, emphasizing differing interlaminar connectivity patterns specific to delta and alpha oscillations respectively, resulting in the distinct routing of information.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Our current study revealed that the entrainment of neuronal oscillations supporting the selection and attentive processing of

stable during the performance of a continuous selective attention task.</s><s>There are lapses of entrainment occurring at regular, 10-30 s time intervals, that correspond to lapses of attention and behavioral responding.</s><s>While periods of oscillatory entrainment are characterized by delta-theta frequency patterning of gamma oscillatory activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref>) and neuronal firing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref>), lapses of entrainment are characterized by the increased amplitude of alpha oscillations, and alpha frequency band patterning of high frequency neuronal ensemble (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref>) and single neuron activity (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref>).</s><s>Together with divergent variations in interlaminar cortical coherence between entrainment and no-entrainment brain states (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>), these data outline two distinct operational modes of auditory cortical neuronal populations, that likely subserve distinct perceptual-cognitive functions.</s><s>The counter-phase fluctuation of neuronal dynamics we detected in primary auditory cortex bares striking similarities to the counterphase fluctuation of resting state oscillations detected by neuroimaging studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and their correlation to alpha-beta frequency band EEG activity in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> .</s><s>We therefore propose that the distinct neuronal ensemble and single neuron dynamics described by our study reflect the linking of auditory cortex machinery to task positive (entrainment) vs. task negative (high alpha) large scale functional networks.</s></p><p><s>One of the most important findings of our current study is that the slow counterphase modulation of entrainment vs. no-entrainment periods is independent of the temporal structure of the task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>This indicates that the slow fluctuations of neuronal dynamics observed in our study are orchestrated by internally timed mechanisms, which is why we argue that it can be linked to large scale functional networks detected in neuroimaging studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> .</s><s>While anti-correlations in the fMRI signal have been proposed to be simply an artifactual consequence of global-signal regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> , our electrophysiological findings provide confirmation that counterphase modulations of the patterning of neuronal activity do occur in cortical neuronal ensembles on temporal scales that are comparable to the lowfrequency fluctuations identified by neuroimaging studies.</s><s>Alternatively, as a recent study by van den Brink et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> demonstrated, periods of "no entrainment" observed in our data could occur following behavioral errors.</s><s>However, since the overall false alarm rate was low in our study (Fig 1b), and in some trial blocks false alarms did not occur at all, (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), this explanation is unlikely.</s><s>Nevertheless, the second, higher frequency peak in the moving ITC spectrum, which corresponds to the rate at which targets occurred (ITC2, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b-c</ref>), might be due to a similar process that distracts from the current task and diminishes entrainment temporarily following target stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Despite our subjects' poor behavioral performance during the no-entrainment, high alpha amplitude periods, our data challenge the notion that alpha oscillations merely reflect suppression, if, as customary, gamma oscillatory amplitudes and neuronal firing rates are taken as indicators of neuronal ensemble excitability, since we found that both of these increased during the high alpha amplitude brain state.</s><s>This seems to indicate that in addition to controlling excitability, the main role of neuronal oscillations -including alpha -is to impose differing activity patterns on neuronal ensembles, a side effect of which might be impaired responding to stimuli.</s><s>These contrasting activity patterns in turn likely promote distinct brain operations, like active sensing vs. internal information processing, and corresponding bottom up vs. top-down dominated information flow.</s><s>Interestingly, Haegens and colleagues also found an overall firing rate increase during highest alpha amplitude periods in primary somatosensory cortex, but not in secondary somatosensory, or motor cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> , indicating that primary cortices might differ in alpha related effects from other regions.</s><s>Alternatively, since we have overwhelming evidence that the brain does utilize alpha oscillations to suppress cortical regions that are irrelevant for goal directed sensory processing (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> ), it is possible that this most commonly detected "suppressive alpha" is different from the "timing alpha" described by our study and the study of Saalmann and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> .</s><s>We speculate that the only reason functionally different alpha rhythms occupy the same frequency space is that they are both referenced to internal timing mechanisms (pacemaker neurons or microcircuits), and not to external stimuli or the pattern of their sampling like delta-theta oscillations.</s><s>Womelsdorf and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> also suggested that there are at least two different types of alpha rhythms in sensory cortices: an infragranularly initiated suppressive alpha, and a pulvinar initiated alpha that is meant to enhance relevant information.</s><s>They speculate that the cortical signature of this latter alpha operational mode should be widespread alpha-gamma cross frequency coupling involving all cortical layers, which is what our study found during periods when delta rhythms were not entrained by sensory stimuli.</s><s>Our data provide strong support for the hypothesis that different brain states are characterized by distinct dynamic motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> , that likely support differing effective connectivity patterns and thereby neuronal computations subserving the selection and integration of relevant information.</s></p><p><s>The finding that different neurons preferentially synchronize their firing to local neuronal ensemble oscillations either during entrainment or during periods dominated by alpha oscillations indicates that by changing the frequency of its neuronal ensemble oscillations, the brain might be able to engage distinct neuronal populations.</s><s>We found that while there are neurons that preferentially fire on certain phases of local delta-theta neuronal ensemble oscillations during entrainment, others synchronize their firing to neuronal ensemble oscillations only during high alpha operational modes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d</ref>).</s><s>This is likely due to the different neurons' or neuronal ensembles' resonance properties determined by their cellular properties and/or connectivity patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> .</s><s>A relatively small portion (9%) of neurons we detected could synchronize their firing both to delta-theta and alpha-beta neuronal ensemble oscillations, possibly due to their less sharply tuned cellular-network resonance properties.</s><s>We hypothesize that when neurons do not synchronize their firing to synchronous neuronal ensemble rhythms, the effect of their firing is diminished and they are excluded from neuronal computations due to the lack of "functional convergence" on their target neurons.</s><s>Thus, even though they fire at the same or even higher rate during different brain states, their action potentials will not be taken into account for the currently relevant brain operation.</s><s>While future modeling and single cell studies are needed to verify this scenario, our data provide strong support for the notion that by simply switching the frequency at which cortical neuronal ensembles oscillate, distinct neuronal groups can be recruited and effectively connected by distinct intra-and interlaminar oscillatory patterns.</s></p><p><s>In the introduction we attributed short timescale oscillations in neuronal ensembles as a means for maintaining an ideal excitability state while conserving energy 1 .</s><s>Along this line of thought, what might the long timescale variations of neuronal ensemble dynamics uncovered by our study and numerous prior studies be meant to maintain?</s><s>Based on our current results we propose that they maintain an ideal balance of delta-theta entrainment dominated external vs. alpha-beta dominated internal oriented information processing.</s><s>If true, ultraslow resting state oscillations maintaining this perceptual-cognitive balance likely exist so that brain operations are not "captured" by the external or the internal environment for long periods of time.</s><s>For example, the unavoidable "return" of the alpha dominated brain state during selective attention would allow for detaching from external stimulation, reevaluating current goals, and updating the cognitive context in which external stimuli are evaluated.</s><s>In this theoretical framework, if this "detaching mechanism" overacts, the brain simply cannot connect to the external world, which might be the underlying cause of the lack of entrainment in Schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> .</s><s>In fact, several recent neuroimaging studies provide evidence that the task negative default mode network is indeed overactive in Schizophrenia patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> , and that this is accompanied by increased alpha frequency band neuronal activity in the same regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48</ref> .</s></p><p><s>As we previously proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> , the two hubs orchestrating externally (entrainment) vs. internally (high alpha) directed information processing dynamics could be core-matrix organized thalamic relay nuclei on one hand and the pulvinar on the other, with the thalamic reticular nucleus balancing their influence in counterphase.</s><s>While this hypothesis needs to be tested, it is feasible to think that impairments at any node of this large scale thalamocortical system maintaining the perceptual-cognitive balance would lead to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, like schizophrenia and ADHD.</s><s>Global dynamics of the moving ITC measure used in our study could provide a useful tool to aid diagnosis in these cases, and since moving ITC enables tracking attention practically in realtime, it could also provide the basis for closed-loop biofeedback therapeutic techniques, or training of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> .</s><s>In addition, this measure might prove to be an extremely useful tool in assessing attention in subjects who cannot cooperate easily, like infants and autistic subjects.</s></p><p><s>To summarize, we identified two distinct, counterphase fluctuating brain states in the auditory cortex of subjects performing a selective intermodal attention task.</s><s>These brain states were characterized by distinct neuronal dynamics: one framed by oscillations adapting to the temporal structure of external events and one by alpha oscillations, providing an external linked versus internal linked temporal reference frame for the coordination of neuronal computations.</s><s>The slow fluctuation of these two brain states likely reflects the counterphase modulation of task positive and task negative large scale networks, which we propose is meant to maintain an ideal perceptual-cognitive balance.</s></p></div>

entrainment.</s><s>To achieve a relatively good frequency resolution, in the &lt;0.2 Hz frequency range we decided to use a 1 second stepping of the window, which resulted in a 4 s overlap.</s><s>Using the Rayleigh statistic, we determined whether the ITC value for a given 5-second-long window was significant or not.</s><s>This enabled us to sort trials into 4 different entrainment based categories: 1) significant delta ITC related to auditory stimuli (ITCa), 2) significant delta ITC related to visual stimuli (ITCv), 3) lack of any significant ITC (noITC) or 4) ITC to both stimuli (ITC both).</s><s>Since the latter category occurred very rarely (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), and not in all experiments, we did not analyze neuronal activity during these time windows.</s><s>Moving alpha amplitudes were calculated in the same time-windows, and were averaged across all cortical layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Given the lack of evoked responses to non-BF auditory and visual stimuli that could result in spurious phase bias, if delta ITC is significant in any given 5 second window, this indicates that delta oscillations in that period were well aligned to the timing of stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Because in theory, phase alignment can be incidental if the frequency of ongoing delta oscillation is similar to the repetition rate of stimuli, we also tested whether mean phases for significant ITC time-periods were biased.</s><s>The rationale is that if phase alignment is incidental from time to time (resulting in occasional high ITC), this should yield a random mean phase distribution, while true entrainment should result in a biased phase distribution (i.e.</s><s>similar mean phases for high ITC time periods).</s><s>We found that the distributions of mean phases for significant ITC periods were significantly biased in all recordings analyzed (Rayleigh test, all p&lt;0.05), for both the auditory and visual stimulus streams, indicating that significant ITC values indeed index oscillatory entrainment.</s></p><p><s>To compensate for the varying numbers of trials across entrainment categories potentially biasing ITC measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58</ref> , we used a repetitive combination technique to calculate ITC: for each group of trials in each experiment, we randomly drew 50 from all available trials, calculated ITC, repeated this 100 times, and averaged the 100 ITC values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Burst-CSD and spike-CSD coherence values were calculated the same way.</s><s>This allowed us to statistically compare delta-theta vs. alpha-beta spike-CSD coherence between the groups of 100 ITC spectra for entrainment vs. 100 ITC spectra for no entrainment time periods for each single unit individually (Wilcoxon signed rank, p&lt;0.01;</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d.</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Laminar oscillatory amplitudes across different recordings were aligned by interpolating amplitude values across channels from the electrode on the top of the cortex to the electrode on the bottom of the cortex to a constant 500 data points.</s><s>This allowed us to statistically compare layer specific amplitude changes between different entrainment conditions across all A1 recordings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Gamma bursts were identified by first using a publicly available Matlab peak detection algorithm (peakfinder by Nathanael C. Yoder, matlab central), with default settings.</s><s>Next we selected bursts that had a clear peak in not just time, but also in the gamma frequency range (30 -55).</s><s>This was done by omitting bursts which had their largest energy around the "edges" of the gamma band (either at 30 or 55 Hz), to avoid wide band, usually 1/f spectral composition artifacts that would also create a gamma peak in the time domain.</s></p><p><s>Single unit isolation and sorting was performed offline using the Plexon Offline Sorter.</s><s>To avoid classifying the same units as different in attend auditory vs. attend visual trial blocks of the same experiment due to possible electrode movement between the times when the two blocks were recorded, we only utilized attend auditory trial blocks for single unit analyses.</s><s>Spike detection threshold was set manually to 3.5 standard deviation of the 300-5000Hz bandpass filtered signal.</s><s>Spikes were sorted using the K-means algorithm, and only neurons with a downward voltage deflection followed by an upward peak were included in the analyses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Delta and alpha coherence between all electrode pairs that yielded the laminar coherence matrices in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> were calculated at 1.6 Hz and 11 Hz using standard techniques in 5second-long sliding windows, similar to moving delta ITC.</s><s>This allowed us to test changes in cross-laminar coherence during periods of entrainment vs. no entrainment within each recording (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>).</s></p></div>
