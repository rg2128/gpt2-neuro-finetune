<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>architecture regulator Cohesin in ADCV granule neurons in adult mice disrupts enhancer-promoter interactions, activity-dependent transcription, and motor learning.</s><s>These findings define how sensory experience patterns chromatin architecture and neural circuit coding in the brain to drive motor learning.</s></p><p><s>We developed a behavior paradigm that might be represented in the ADCV.</s><s>The startle response is an evolutionarily conserved predator-evading animal reflex triggered by activation of trigeminal nerve dermatomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>We induced the startle response by tactile stimulation of the nose of a head-fixed mouse on a treadmill using a motorized animal toy as the stimulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>).</s><s>Robust backward mouse locomotion was induced within 20 ms of electrically triggering tactile stimulation of the nose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>), but not of the tail (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>).</s><s>When an LED used as the conditioned stimulus (CS) was repeatedly paired with a toy tactile stimulus as the unconditioned stimulus (US), animals learned to move backward in response to the LED cue over several days of training, including in catch trials in response to the CS only (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>-e and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>).</s><s>These results establish delay tactile startle conditioning as a novel motor learning paradigm.</s></p><p><s>Delivery of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol into the ADCV and in particular into the caudal ADCV, but not the contiguous lobule VI, robustly inhibited acquisition of the conditioned startle response in mice, but had little or no effect on the unconditioned response or gait dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1f</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c-g</ref>).</s><s>In an optogenetic approach, silencing of granule neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> specifically in the ADCV during presentation of the CS inhibited acquisition of the conditioned response in mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g-i</ref>).</s><s>Little or no change in tactile startle conditioning was observed in distinct types of control mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Direct optogenetic stimulation (optostimulation) of granule neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> in the ADCV as the CS, with the tactile stimulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>, h and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>), triggered rapid associative motor learning in mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1j</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, optostimulation of granule neurons in lobule IX as the CS or of distinct types of control mice failed to induce motor learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1j</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Together, our data suggest that the ADCV is required and sufficient for associative learning in the delay tactile startle conditioning paradigm.</s><s>Notably, optostimulation of granule neurons in lobule VI as the CS induced animals to move backward (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e</ref>), suggesting that activation of lobule VI is sufficient, though not essential, to trigger motor learning.</s></p><p><s>In other experiments, optostimulation of Purkinje cells in the ADCV, but not in lobule IX, as the US led to acquisition of conditioned startle responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">h,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, our data suggest that cerebellar cortical circuits in the ADCV orchestrate delay tactile startle conditioning.</s></p><p><s>We next characterized how neural circuit activity in the ADCV evolves with learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>).</s><s>Granule neurons expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6f <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> were robustly activated in the ADCV in response to the CS in mice with motor learning, but not in naive mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>-f and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a-c</ref>).</s><s>CS-evoked granule neuron activity in the ADCV in trained mice was present in the presence or absence of expression of the conditioned response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>, g and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d</ref>).</s><s>Granule neuron calcium transients were increased in lobule VI with motor learning, but only upon expression of the conditioned response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e</ref>, f and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Purkinje cell dendrites in the ADCV and lobule VI displayed calcium responses to the CS in naive mice, which were significantly enhanced in the ADCV, but not in lobule VI, upon motor learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2h</ref>-j and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s><s>The increase in CS-dependent Purkinje cell calcium transients occurred independently of the conditioned response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>Together, our data suggest that motor learning in the delay tactile startle paradigm triggers transformations in the CS-dependent neural code in granule neuron and Purkinje cell circuits specifically in the ADCV in adult mice.</s></p><p><s>We next interrogated the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to neural circuit activation in the cerebellum during motor learning.</s><s>In 52 RNA-Seq datasets, comparison of mice subjected to a battery of sensorimotor stimuli versus homecage control mice revealed over 2000 differentially expressed transcripts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>).</s><s>A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> facilitated clustering of the adult cerebellar transcriptome into 26 distinct gene modules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>), which upon intersection with cerebellar cell type-specific expression data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , were enriched in granule neurons, Bergmann glia, Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons, or oligodendrocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Sensorimotor stimuli regulated the expression of 10 gene modules enriched in granule neurons and Bergmann glia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>), including genes encoding immediate early transcription factors and cAMP-regulated signaling proteins (lightcyan), synaptic proteins (brown), and oxidative phosphorylation proteins (salmon) in granule neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>).</s><s>Silencing of ADCV cortical activity with muscimol reversed the locomotion-induced gene expression changes in the lightcyan and midnightblue modules (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, the conditioned stimulus (CS) in the delay tactile startle conditioning task activated the lightcyan, midnightblue, and salmon modules and repressed the brown gene module (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3f</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e-g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Direct optostimulation of the granule neuron CS pathway in the ADCV rapidly activated the lightcyan and midnightblue modules and repressed the brown module (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3g</ref>, h and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Optostimulation of granule neurons also modulated expression of enhancer RNA (eRNA) and upstream antisense RNA (uaRNA) nearby CS-regulated genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3i</ref>, j and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>In vivo optostimulation of granule neurons in the ADCV followed by ChIP-Seq analyses revealed that H3K27ac enrichment at promoters and enhancers of CS-regulated gene modules positively correlated and H2A.z enrichment at promoters inversely correlated with gene expression upon activation of the CS pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3i</ref>-k and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>The histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 exhibited little or no change at CS-regulated gene promoters in response to optostimulation of granule neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3j</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>The promoters and enhancers of CSregulated granule neuron module genes were enriched with distinct activity-dependent transcription factor-binding motifs (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, our results demonstrate that activation of the granule neuron CS pathway triggers distinct epigenetic mechanisms in the ADCV of adult mice in vivo.</s></p><p><s>To detemine if the three-dimensional organization of chromatin architecture might be regulated in a dynamic manner in the brain, we employed in situ chromosome conformation capture with high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C) and proximity ligation-assisted ChIP-Seq (PLAC-Seq), the latter to enrich for promoter-centric interactions at H3K4me3-marked promoters <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>).</s><s>Model-based analysis of long-range chromatin interactions from PLAC-Seq (MAPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> identified 22,430 long-distance promoter-centric interactions in optostimulated and control mice, enriched for regulatory regions of the genome marked by H3K27ac or CTCF occupancy (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10a</ref>).</s><s>At the locus of the activitydependent gene nr4a1, promoter interactions with enhancers within ~30Kb upstream from the TSS and in particular with the distal ~30Kb enhancer increased upon granule neuron activation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>).</s><s>In genome-wide analyses, enhancer-promoter interactions at the CSinduced lightcyan and midnightblue module genes were increased and in particular with distal enhancers, whereas enhancer-promoter interactions were reduced in the CS-repressed brown gene module in the ADCV upon optostimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Enhancer-promoter interactions correlated with the levels of H3K27ac at gene promoters, but not with the levels of H3K27ac at proximal versus distal enhancers, upon optostimulation of ADCV granule neurons in adult mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10b-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Consistently with PLAC-Seq analyses, DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses using probes targeting the nr4a3 gene and its distal enhancer located 500Kb upsteam revealed that the distance between the nr4a3 enhancer and the nr4a3 gene was reduced upon optostimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4e</ref>, f and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>Together, these data suggest that activation of the granule neuron CS pathway strengthens long distance enhancer-promoter interactions and tightly co-regulates enhancer-promoter interactions and gene transcription in vivo.</s></p><p><s>Genomic loci with increased H3K27ac levels in the ADCV upon optostimulation had enhanced association with transcriptionally active (A) compartments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4g-i</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10i</ref>).</s><s>However, genes with decreased H3K27ac levels had reduced association with active (A) compartments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4i</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10i</ref>).</s><s>Interaction frequencies of genomic loci across chromosomes was also augmented with increased H3K27ac in optostimulated ADCV granule neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4j</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10j</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that activated genes might be recruited to active transcriptional compartments to achieve efficient gene expression upon activation of the CS pathway in vivo (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4k</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next characterized mechanisms underlying activity-dependent chromatin architecture remodeling in vivo and its role in motor learning.</s><s>The protein complex Cohesin is required in loop formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>), but its role in the brain has remained largely unexplored.</s><s>The occupancy of the core Cohesin subunit Rad21 at enhancers and promoters correlated with changes in H3K27 acetylation enrichment in the ADCV upon optostimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b-d</ref>).</s><s>We employed a conditional CRISPR approach to induce knockout of Rad21 in ADCV granule neurons in adult mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e</ref>-g and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10k</ref>), bypassing developmental effects of Cohesin inactivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Strikingly, Rad21 knockout significantly reduced enhancer-promoter interactions in the ADCV of mice undergoing delay tactile startle learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>Rad21 knockout attenuated induction of the midnightblue gene module in the ADCV upon delay tactile startle conditioning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5j</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10l</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, Rad21 knockout in ADCV granule neurons significantly impaired acquisition of the conditioned startle response in mice (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5k</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, these results suggest that Cohesin-dependent reorganization of chromatin architecture and activation of transcription plays a critical role in associative motor learning in mice.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we define how sensory experience transduced via a granule neuron pathway triggers dynamic remodeling of chromatin architecture and neural circuit activity in the ADCV of the adult mouse brain to
