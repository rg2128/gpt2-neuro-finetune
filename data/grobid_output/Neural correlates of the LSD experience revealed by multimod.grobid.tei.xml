namely, expanded V1 RSFC relates to the magnitude of visual hallucinations and decoupling of the PH-RSC circuit relates to the level of ego-dissolution, and perhaps also the profundity of a psychedelic experience more generally (also see refs. 9 and 10 in this regard).</s></p><p><s>Before concluding, we should highlight some general limitations of the present study and address a discrepant finding in the field.</s><s>Regarding limitations, a fully randomized, double-blind design is often considered the gold standard; however, experimental blinding is known to be ineffective in studies with conspicuous interventions.</s><s>Thus, a single-blind, balanced-order design with an inert placebo (offering the simplest and "cleanest" possible control condition) was considered an effective compromise.</s><s>Also, although the multimodal design of this study was an advantage, the experimental protocol was demanding for participants, and the different scan types (ASL, BOLD, and MEG) occurred separately in time.</s><s>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI may therefore offer some advantageous in this regard.</s><s>Another general limitation of imaging studies involving potent psychoactive drugs, is the issue of between-condition differences in head motion and related artifacts.</s><s>In this study, we opted to use the most rigorous motion-correction strategies available (SI Appendix), despite motion levels being no higher than those seen in previous studies by our group <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Regarding the discrepant finding, a previous psilocybin ASL study of ours revealed decreased CBF postpsilocybin (i.v.) during eyes-open rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, whereas the present i.v.</s><s>LSD study found increased CBF localized to the visual cortex with eyes-closed rest.</s><s>One must be cautious of proxy measures of neural activity (that lack temporal resolution), such as CBF or glucose metabolism, lest the relationship between these measures, and the underlying neural activity they are assumed to index, be confounded by extraneous factors, such as a direct vascular action of the drug  <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</s><s>For this reason, more direct measures of neural activity (e.g., EEG and MEG) and/or more dynamic fMRI measures (e.g., RSFC) should be considered more reliable indices of the functional brain effects of psychedelics, and it is notable in this regard that our previous MEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and RSFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref> findings with psilocybin are highly consistent with those observed here with LSD.</s><s>Thus, rather than speculate on the above-mentioned discrepancy, it may be more progressive to highlight the advantages of EEG/MEG and dynamic fMRI and conclude that further work would be required to resolve discrepancies in the literature regarding the effects of psychedelics on metabolically related metrics that lack temporal resolution.</s></p><p><s>Finally, as evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of psychedelics mounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, so does our need to better understand how these drugs work on the brain.</s><s>In many psychiatric disorders, the brain may be viewed as having become entrenched in pathology, such that core behaviors become automated and rigid.</s><s>Consistent with their "entropic" effect on cortical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, psychedelics may work to break down such disorders by dismantling the patterns of activity on which they rest.</s><s>Future work is required to test this hypothesis and the others that have been presented here as part of a broader initiative to properly utilize these valuable scientific tools.</s></p></div>
