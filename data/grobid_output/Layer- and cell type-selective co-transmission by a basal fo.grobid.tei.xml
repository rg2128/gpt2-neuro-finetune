Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, however, 19 of 22 dSACs having cell bodies in or near the IPL exhibited robust light-evoked short-latency excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (Figs.</s><s>4c-f and 5).</s><s>The peak EPSC amplitudes did not significantly differ between ChAT Cre and VGLUT3 Cre mouse lines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4h</ref>), consistent with the idea that the VGLUT3 + HDB neurons form a large proportion of the cholinergic projections from the HDB to the IPL.</s><s>Repetitive optogenetic activation at 5 and 20 Hz evoked EPSCs with high probability (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>), suggesting that bursts of HDB activity may powerfully influence dSAC activity.</s><s>MOB dSACs can be subdivided by their axonal projections into granule cell layer (GCL)-, EPL-, and GL-projecting dSACs (GCL/EPL/GL-dSACs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Strikingly, post hoc morphological reconstruction of the recorded dSACs revealed that BF input preferentially (and possibly exclusively) targeted GL-dSACs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Of the 22 total dSACs recorded, we recovered 9 with sufficiently intact axons to enable classification: 6 were GL-dSACs, 0 were EPL-dSACs, and 3 were GCL-dSACs, consistent with the laminar distribution of GL-, EPL-, and GCL-dSACs previously observed in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Light-evoked EPSCs were detected in all 6 confirmed GL-dSACs, but not in any of the confirmed GCL-dSACs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5o</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the 13 dSACs with unrecovered axonal projection patterns (?-dSACs) all exhibited light-evoked EPSCs and were located in the IPL or superficial GCL, where GL-dSACs comprise the majority of dSACs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Given the limited number of recovered GCL-and EPL-dSACs, and the focus of our recordings to cells in or near the IPL where dense HDB projections were observed, we cannot exclude the possibility that HDB projections likewise innervate EPL-dSACs and/or a subset of GCL-dSACs.</s><s>Nevertheless, our data strikingly demonstrate that cholinergic HDB projections to the IPL selectively innervate dSACs, and preferentially (and possibly exclusively) innervate GL-dSACs.</s></p><p><s>Co-transmission by an HDB projection to the IPL.</s><s>The fact that VGLUT3 + HDB projections to the IPL express VAChT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) suggests that the light-evoked EPSCs recorded in dSACs may be cholinergic, glutamatergic, or both.</s><s>We therefore performed  Peak -60 mV (pA) a series of pharmacological experiments to determine the identity of the neurotransmitters released at these synapses.</s><s>First, we tested whether the VGLUT3 + projections release acetylcholine.</s><s>Light-evoked EPSCs persisted following combined application of glutamatergic antagonists NBQX (10 μM) and AP5 (50 μM) and GABAergic antagonist gabazine (Gbz; 10 μM), but were abolished by subsequent application of the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (Mec; 20-50 μM; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>Mec likewise strongly reduced the light-evoked EPSC in slices from ChAT Cre mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>).</s><s>Subtraction of post-Mec currents from pre-Mec currents across both mouse lines yielded EPSCs with kinetics (τ = 33.5 ± 19.6 ms, n = 16) consistent with α2 subunit-containing nicotinic receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , providing further evidence for HDB innervation of GL-dSACs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>We did not observe any evidence of long-lasting Mec-insensitive currents mediated by muscarinic receptors following brief light pulses (10-20 ms) in either dSACs or other MOB cell types (Figs.</s><s>4d, f and 5n), including in a subset of cells recorded with a K + -based intracellular solution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>The lack of light-evoked muscarinic currents is consistent with a recent report in which no muscarinic modulation of MCs was observed following brief optogenetic stimulation of HDB cholinergic projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , and only very weak hyperpolarization (~0.5 mV) was observed following prolonged (10 Hz train over 15 s) optogenetic stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>Collectively, our results demonstrate that VGLUT3 + HDB neurons project preferentially to the IPL and release acetylcholine to mediate robust nicotinic input onto dSACs.</s><s>Of note, this is the first reported observation of monosynaptic cholinergic currents in the MOB.</s><s>We next examined whether HDB projections to the IPL release glutamate.</s><s>To avoid the possible confound of optogenetically activating the non-cholinergic subpopulation of VGLUT3 + HDB neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we used ChAT Cre mice.</s><s>Application of NBQX/AP5 consistently reduced the peak EPSC amplitudes to 84.8 ± 4.1% of baseline (range: 81.1-90.0%),</s><s>though this effect was not significant (p = 0.38; n = 4; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, a residual light-evoked postsynaptic current was observed even in the presence of glutamatergic and nicotinic antagonists (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>We therefore tested whether this residual postsynaptic current reflected an incompletely voltage-clamped GABAergic input.</s><s>In 10 of the 14 cells tested that exhibited light-evoked EPSCs, depolarization to +10 mV (i.e., near the EPSC reversal potential) revealed a pronounced light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">f,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>The latencies of the light-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs did not differ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>), suggesting that the two neurotransmitters are released simultaneously by ChR2-EYFP + HDB projections and arguing against the possibility that the IPSCs reflect feedforward inhibition.</s><s>Consistent with the direct release of both acetylcholine and GABA rather than feedforward inhibition, light-evoked IPSCs persisted after excitatory input was blocked (with NBQX/AP5 and Mec), but were abolished by subsequent application of Gbz (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>In total, 6 of 6 cells in VGLUT3 Cre mice and 4 of 8 cells in ChAT Cre mice exhibited light-evoked IPSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4h</ref>).</s><s>Results from our pharmacological experiments thus demonstrate that HDB cholinergic neurons projecting to the IPL release both acetylcholine and GABA onto dSACs.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V hold =+10 mV -60 +10 V hold (mV)</formula></div>
