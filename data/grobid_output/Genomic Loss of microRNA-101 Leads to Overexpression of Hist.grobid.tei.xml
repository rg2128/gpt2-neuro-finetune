<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>EZH2 has properties consistent with those of an oncogene, as overexpression promotes cell proliferation, colony formation, and increased invasion of

diminished tumor growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> and metastasis in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>EZH2 was initially found to be elevated in a subset of aggressive, clinically localized prostate cancers and almost all metastatic prostate cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(4)</ref>.</s><s>Subsequently EZH2 has also been found to be aberrantly overexpressed in breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>, melanoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>, bladder cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>, gastric cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref> and other cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, while EZH2 is broadly overexpressed in aggressive solid tumors and has properties of an oncogene, the genetic mechanism of EZH2 elevation in cancer is unclear.</s></p><p><s>As microRNAs (miRNAs) have gained considerable attention as regulators of gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref>, and play important roles in cellular differentiation and embryonic stem cell development <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>, we postulated that they may play a role in modulating EZH2 expression.</s><s>In order to test whether miRNAs play a role in controlling EZH2 expression, we computationally nominated those that might contribute to EZH2 regulation.</s><s>Since it has been determined that intersecting the results of multiple prediction algorithms can increase specificity, at the cost of lower sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>, we chose to integrate the results of the prediction programs PicTar <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>, TargetScan <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>, miRanda <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>, and miRInspector <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Overall, only 29 miRNAs were found by any program to target EZH2, while only miR-101 and miR-217 were found by all four programs to be predicted to regulate EZH2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, PicTar, miRanda, and TargetScan predicted two miR-101 binding sites within the EZH2 3'UTR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) whereas PicTar and TargetScan predicted two miR-217 binding sites within the EZH2 3'UTR.</s><s>Of the 34 miRNAs predicted to regulate EZH2 by at least one program (table <ref type="table">S1</ref>), only miR-101 had a strong negative association with prostate cancer progression from benign to localized disease to metastasis (as covered later in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To examine whether miR-101 could regulate the 3'UTR of EZH2, we generated luciferase reporters encoding the normal, antisense, and mutated versions of the EZH2 3'UTR.</s><s>Overexpression of miR-101, but not miR-217 or control miRNA decreased the activity of the luciferase reporter encoding the 3'UTR of EZH2 (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, the antisense and mutant EZH2 3'UTR activity were not inhibited by miR-101.</s><s>In order to test whether the 3'UTR binding by miR-101 results in down-regulation of the EZH2 transcript, we transfected SKBr3 breast cancer cells (which express high level of endogenous EZH2) with precursors of miR-101, miR-217, control miRNA as well as several other unrelated miRNAs.</s><s>qRT-PCR clearly demonstrated a reduction in EZH2 transcript levels by miR-101 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), but not miR-217 or other control miRs.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether miR-101 represses EZH2 protein expression, we performed immunoblot analysis using an EZH2 specific antibody, as well as antibodies to other PRC2 members, including EED and SUZ12 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>In addition to miR-101, we also included other miRNAs predicted to regulate EZH2 including miR-217 and miR-26a.</s><s>Control miR-495 was predicted by TargetScan to target PRC1 component BMI-1.</s><s>Only miR-101 and EZH2 siRNA attenuated EZH2 protein expression.</s><s>Interestingly, miR-101 overexpression also leads to repression of EZH2's tight binding partners in the PRC2 complex, EED, and to a lesser extent SUZ12.</s><s>These proteins, are thought to form a co-regulated functional complex and altering the expression of one affects the expression of the others <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27)</ref>.</s><s>In this particular case, upon further inspection of the 3'UTRs of the PRC2 components, miR-101 binding sites were found in EED (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>) but not in SUZ12.</s><s>Since miRNAs are known to regulate multiple target genes, and in some cases over hundreds of genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref>, we used the prediction algorithm TargetScan to nominate targets of miR-101.</s><s>In addition to EZH2 and EED, we tested 4 miR-101 predicted targets (table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) that have been implicated in cancer pathways including n-Myc, c-Fos, ARID1A, and FBN2.</s><s>Importantly, none of these putative miR-101 targets were affected by overexpression of miR-101 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>To support the findings from our miR-101 overexpression experiments, we employed antagomiR technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref> to specifically inhibit miR-101 expression in benign immortalized breast epithelial cells (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Two independent antagomiRs to miR101 (i and ii) induced expression of EZH2 protein in benign breast epithelial cells.</s></p><p><s>While we have strong evidence that miR-101 regulates EZH2 expression, we wanted to determine whether it affects EZH2 and PRC2 function.</s><s>To accomplish this we evaluated cellular proliferation, a property known to be regulated by EZH2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5)</ref>.</s><s>miR-101 overexpression in SKBr3 and DU145 cells markedly attenuated cell proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>, fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, overexpression of EZH2 (without an endogenous 3'UTR) rescued the inhibition of cell growth by miR-101 suggesting target specificity.</s></p><p><s>Previously, we showed that upon overexpression, EZH2 can induce cell invasion in matrigelcoated basement membrane invasion assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>.</s><s>Here we show that miR-101 overexpression markedly inhibits the in vitro invasive potential of DU145 prostate cancer cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) and SKBr3 breast cancer cells (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, stable expression of miR-101 in DU145 cells showed reduction in EZH2 expression and reduced invasion (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S6A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Overexpression of EZH2, rescued the inhibition mediated by miR-101.</s><s>Another in vitro readout for cancer potential, increased cell migration, was also inhibited by miR-101 (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>As overexpression of miR-101 attenuates cancer invasion, inhibition of miR-101 should enhance this neoplastic phenotype.</s><s>Two independent antagomiRs targeting miR-101 (i and ii) induced an invasive phenotype when transfected into benign immortalized breast epithelial cell lines H16N2 or HME (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To assess whether miR-101 inhibits anchorage-independent growth, we employed a soft agar assay.</s><s>DU145 prostate cancer cells stably overexpressing miR-101 exhibited markedly reduced colony formation relative to the parental cells or vector controls (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, in vivo, DU145 cells expressing miR-101 grew significantly slower than the vector control xenografts (p= 0.0001, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>) demonstrating that miR-101 has properties consistent with that of a tumor suppressor in these particular assays.</s></p><p><s>As EZH2 and PRC2 are known to regulate gene expression by tri-methylating H3K27, we hypothesized that miR-101 overexpression would result in decreased overall H3K27 trimethylation in cancer cells.</s><s>SKBr3 breast cancer and DU145 prostate cancer cells transfected with miR-101 or EZH2 siRNA for 7 days displayed global decrease in tri-methyl H3K27 levels (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10A</ref>).</s><s>The effect of miR-101 on H3K27 methylation can be negated by overexpression of EZH2 (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In order to test the level of promoter occupancy of the H3K27 histone mark, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in cancer cells overexpressing miR-101.</s><s>We found significant reduction in the tri-methyl H3K27 histone mark at the promoter of known PRC2 target genes such as ADRB2, DAB2IP, CIITA and WNT1 in miR-101 overexpressing SKBr3 cells and EZH2 siRNA treated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>).</s><s>In order to test if the reduced promoter occupancy by H3K27 results in concomitant reduction of gene expression, we performed qRT-PCR on the PRC2 targets tested by ChIP assay.</s><s>As expected, there was a significant increase in target gene expression in both miR-101 and EZH2 siRNA treated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>To further explore miR-101 regulation of EZH2 and test similarities with EZH2 specific RNA interference, we tested whether miR-101 overexpression and EZH2 knockdown generated similar gene expression profiles.</s><s>To assess this, we conducted gene expression array analysis of SKBr3 cells transfected with either miR-101 or EZH2 siRNA duplexes.</s><s>Genes that were overexpressed at the 2-fold threshold were significantly overlapping in both the miR-101 and EZH2 siRNA transfected cells (p= 6.08e-17) (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, those genes that were repressed also had significant overlap (p= 3.24e-27).</s></p><p><s>Next, we wanted to determine whether miR-101 expression inversely correlates with EZH2 levels in human tumors.</s><s>A meta-analysis of a majority of the publicly available miRNA expression datasets suggested that miR-101 is significantly under-expressed in prostate, breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers (table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s><s>As EZH2 was initially found to be overexpressed in a subset of aggressive clinically localized prostate cancers and almost universally elevated in metastatic disease(4), we proceeded to examine miR-101 in a similar context of prostate cancer progression by doing qPCR analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>, fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref>).</s><s>As expected, metastatic prostate cancers expressed significantly higher levels of EZH2 as compared to clinically localized disease or benign adjacent prostate tissue (p&lt;0.0001).</s><s>Consistent with a functional connection between miR-101 and EZH2, miR-101 expression was significantly decreased in metastatic prostate cancer relative to clinically localized disease or benign adjacent prostate tissue (p&lt;0.0001).</s><s>Importantly, miR-217, which like miR-101 was predicted to regulate EZH2, did not exhibit significant differences between metastatic disease and clinically localized prostate cancer or benign prostate (p=0.35 and 0.13, respectively).</s></p><p><s>To investigate the mechanism for miR-101 transcript loss in prostate cancer progression, we performed quantitative genomic PCR for miR-101.</s><s>Of note, miR-101 has two genomic loci that are on chromosome 1 (miR-101-1) and chromosome 9 (miR-101-2) (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Based on genomic PCR, 2 of 16 clinically localized prostate cancers and 17 of 33 metastatic prostate cancers exhibited loss of the miR-101-1 locus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, 4 of 16 clinically localized prostate cancers and 8 of 33 metastatic prostate cancers displayed loss of miR-101-2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref> displays a heatmap representation of matched samples in which miR-101 transcript, EZH2 transcript, miR-101-1 genomic loci and miR-101-2 genomic loci were monitored.</s><s>EZH2 transcript levels were inversely associated with miR-101 transcript levels across prostate cancer progression to metastasis (p&lt;0.0001).</s><s>EZH2 tended to be uniformly elevated in samples in which the miR-101-1 or miR-101-2 genomic loci exhibited copy number loss (p=0.004,</s><s>permutation test).</s></p><p><s>To formally demonstrate that genomic loss of miR-101 loci was somatic in nature, we identified 9 metastatic prostate cancers which exhibited loss of miR-101-1 and obtained DNA from matched normal tissue.</s><s>As expected, 8 of 9 cases exhibited a marked decrease in relative levels of miR-101-1 copy number in the cancer when compared to matched normal tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>To extend our findings to other cancers we explored miR-101 genomic loss in a variety of tumor types.</s><s>Using a number of experimental platforms we demonstrated focal loss (~ 20kB) of miR-101-1 in a subset of breast, gastric and prostate cancers (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S15-S17</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we explored public domain high-density array CGH and SNP array datasets and observed genomic loss of one or both miR-101 loci in a subset of gliobastoma multiforme, lung adenocarcinoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia (supplementary text, fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S18</ref>).</s><s>miR-101, by virtue of its regulation of EZH2, may have profound control over the epigenetic pathways active not only in cancer cells, but in normal pluripotent embryonic stem cells.</s><s>Overexpression of miR-101 presumably can configure the histone code of cancer cells to more of a benign phenotype.</s><s>As the loss of miR-101 and concomitant elevation of EZH2 is most pronounced in metastatic cancer, we postulate that miR-101 loss may represent a progressive molecular lesion in the development of more aggressive disease.</s><s>Approaches to re-introduce miR-101 into tumors may have therapeutic benefit by reverting the epigenetic program of tumor cells to a more normal state.</s><s>miR-101 transcript, EZH2 transcript, and both miR-101-1 and miR-101-2 relative copy number were assessed.</s><s>miR-101 and EZH2 expression is represented by a color scale highlighting down-regulation (green), no alteration (black), and up-regulation (red) of transcripts.</s><s>miR-101-1 and miR-101-2 relative quantitation (RQ) of copy number are represented as homozygous loss (&lt; 0.3; bright green), single copy loss (&lt; 0.7; light green), no copy number change (&gt;= 0.7 and &lt;= 1.3; black), single copy gain (&gt;
