<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>We selected 24 genes as candidates for factors that induce pluripotency in somatic cells, based on our hypothesis that such factors also play pivotal roles in the maintenance of ES cell identity (see Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> in the Supplemental Data available with this article online).</s><s>For b-catenin, c-Myc, and Stat3, we used active forms, S33Y-b-catenin <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sadot et al., 2002)</ref>, T58A-c-Myc <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chang et al., 2000)</ref>, and Stat3-C <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bromberg et al., 1999)</ref>, respectively.</s><s>Because of the reported negative effect of Grb2 on pluripotency <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burdon et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cheng et al., 1998)</ref>, we included its dominant-negative mutant Grb2DSH2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Miyamoto et al., 2004)</ref> as 1 of the 24 candidates.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate these 24 candidate genes, we developed an assay system in which the induction of the pluripotent state could be detected as resistance to G418 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>We inserted a bgeo cassette (a fusion of the b-galactosidase and neomycin resistance genes) into the mouse Fbx15 gene by homologous recombination <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tokuzawa et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Although specifically expressed in mouse ES cells and early embryos, Fbx15 is dispensable for the maintenance of pluripotency and mouse development.</s></p><p><s>ES cells homozygous for the bgeo knockin construct (Fbx15 bgeo/bgeo ) were resistant to extremely high concentrations of G418 (up to 12 mg/ml), whereas somatic cells derived from Fbx15 bgeo/bgeo mice were sensitive to a normal concentration of G418 (0.3 mg/ml).</s><s>We expected that even partial activation of the Fbx15 locus would result in resistance to normal concentrations of G418.</s></p><p><s>We introduced each of the 24 candidate genes into mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Fbx15 bgeo/bgeo  embryos by retroviral transduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Morita et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Transduced cells were then cultured on STO feeder cells in ES cell medium containing G418 (0.3 mg/ml).</s><s>We did not, however, obtain drug-resistant colonies with any single factor, indicating that no single candidate gene was sufficient to activate the Fbx15 locus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>; see also Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, which summarizes all of the transduction experiments in this study).</s></p><p><s>In contrast, transduction of all 24 candidates together generated 22 G418-resistant colonies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Of the 12 clones for which we continued cultivating under selection, 5 clones exhibited morphology similar to ES cells, including a round shape, large nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>We repeated the experiments and observed 29 G418-resistant colonies, from which we picked 6 colonies.</s><s>Four of these clones possessed ES cell-like morphology and proliferation properties (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>The doubling time of these cells <ref type="bibr">(19.4, 17.5, 18.7, and 18.6 hr)</ref> was equivalent to that of ES cells (17.0 hr).</s><s>We desig-nated these cells iPS-MEF24 for ''pluripotent stem cells induced from MEFs by 24 factors.''</s><s>Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the iPS-MEF24 clones expressed ES cell markers, including Oct3/4, Nanog, E-Ras, Cripto, Dax1, and Zfp296 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mitsui et al., 2003)</ref> and Fgf4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Yuan et al., 1995)</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Bisulfite genomic sequencing demonstrated that the promoters of Fbx15 and Nanog were demethylated in iPS cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, the Oct3/4 promoter remained methylated in these cells.</s><s>These data indicate that some combination of these 24 candidate factors induced the expression of ES cell marker genes in MEF culture.</s></p><p><s>Next, to determine which of the 24 candidates were critical, we examined the effect of withdrawal of individual factors from the pool of transduced candidate genes on the formation of G418-resistant colonies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>).</s><s>We identified 10 factors <ref type="bibr">(3, 4, 5, 11, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, and 22)</ref> whose individual withdrawal from the bulk transduction pool resulted in no colony formation 10 days after transduction and fewer colonies 16 days after transduction.</s><s>Combination of these 10 genes alone produced more ES cell-like colonies than transduction of all 24 genes did (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next examined the formation of colonies after withdrawal of individual factors from the 10-factor pool transduced into MEFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>).</s><s>G418-resistant colonies did not form when either Oct3/4 (factor 14) or Klf4 (factor 20) was removed.</s><s>Removal of Sox2 (factor 15) resulted in only a few G418-resistant colonies.</s><s>When we removed c-Myc (factor 22), G418-resistant colonies did emerge, but these had a flatter, non-ES-cell-like morphology.</s><s>Removal of the remaining factors did not significantly affect colony numbers.</s><s>These results indicate that Oct3/4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc play important roles in the generation of iPS cells from MEFs.</s></p><p><s>Combination of the four genes produced a number of G418-resistant colonies similar to that observed with the pool of 10 genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>).</s><s>We continued cultivation of 12 clones for each transduction and were able to establish 4 iPS-MEF4 and 5 iPS-MEF10 clones.</s><s>In addition, we could generate iPS cells (iPS-MEF4wt) with wild-type c-Myc instead of the T58A mutant (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>These data demonstrate that iPS cells can be induced from MEF culture by the introduction of four transcription factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4.</s></p><p><s>No combination of two factors could induce the formation of G418-resistant colonies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>).</s><s>Two combinations of three factors-Oct3/4, Sox2, and c-Myc (minus Klf4) or Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc (minus Oct3/4)-generated a single, small colony in each case, but these could not be maintained in culture.</s><s>With the combination of Oct3/4, Klf4, and Sox2 (minus c-Myc), we observed the formation of 36 G418-resistant colonies, which, however, exhibited a flat, non-ES-cell-like morphology.</s><s>With the combination of Oct3/4, Klf4, and c-Myc (minus Sox2), we observed the formation of 54 G418-resistant colonies, of which we picked 6.</s><s>Although all 6 clones could be maintained over several passages, the morphology of these cells (iPS-MEF3) differed from that of iPS-MEF4 and iPS-MEF10 cells, with iPS-MEF3 colonies exhibiting rough surfaces (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that the combination of Oct3/4, c-Myc, and Klf4 can activate the Fbx15 locus, but the change induced by these three factors alone is different from that seen in iPS-MEF4 or iPS-MEF10 cells.</s></p><p><s>We performed RT-PCR to examine whether ES cell marker genes were expressed in iPS cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>We used primers that would amplify transcripts of the endogenous gene but not transcripts of the transgene.</s><s>iPS-MEF10 and iPS-MEF4 clones expressed the majority of marker genes, with the exception of Ecat1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mitsui et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>The expression of several marker genes, including Oct3/4, was higher in iPS-MEF4-7, iPS-MEF10-6, and iPS-MEF10-7 clones than in the remaining clones.</s><s>Sox2 was only expressed in iPS-MEF10-6.</s><s>The iPS-MEF4wt clone also expressed many of the ES cell marker genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the promoters of Oct3/4 and Nanog had increased acetylation of histone H3 and decreased dimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</s><s>CpG dinucleotides in these promoters remained partially methylated in iPS cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>).</s><s>iPS-MEF4 and iPS-MEF10 cells were positive for alkaline phosphatase and SSEA-1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>) and showed high telomerase activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>These results demonstrate that iPS-MEF4 and iPS-MEF10 cells are similar, but not identical, to ES cells.</s></p><p><s>In iPS-MEF3 clones, Ecat1, Esg1, and Sox2 were not activated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>Nanog was induced, but to a lesser extent than in iPS-MEF4 and iPS-MEF10 clones.</s><s>Oct3/4 was weakly activated in iPS-MEF3-3, -5, and -6 but was not activated in the remaining clones.</s><s>By contrast, E-Ras and Fgf4 were activated more efficiently in iPS-MEF3 than in iPS-MEF10 or iPS-MEF4.</s><s>These data confirm that iPS-MEF3 cells are substantially different from iPS-MEF10 and iPS-MEF4 cells.</s></p><p><s>We compared the global gene-expression profiles of ES cells, iPS cells, and Fbx15 bgeo/bgeo MEFs using DNA microarrays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we examined Fbx15 bgeo/bgeo MEFs in which the four factors had been introduced without G418 selection, immortalized MEFs expressing K-RasV12, and NIH 3T3 cells transformed with H-RasV12.</s><s>Pearson correlation analysis revealed that iPS cells are clustered closely with ES cells but separately from fibroblasts and their derivatives (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>The microarray analyses identified genes that were commonly upregulated in ES cells and iPS cells, including Myb, Kit, Gdf3, and Zic3 (group I, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s><s>Other genes were upregulated more efficiently in ES cells, iPS-MEF4, and iPS-MEF10 than in iPS-MEF3 clones, including Dppa3, Dppa4, Dppa5, Nanog, Sox2, Esrrb, and Rex1 (group II).</s><s>Lower expression of these genes may account for the lack of pluripotency in iPS-MEF3 cells.</s><s>In addition, we found genes that were upregulated more prominently in ES cells than in iPS cells, including Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Dnmt3l, Utf1, Tcl1, and the LIF receptor gene (group III).</s><s>These data confirm that iPS cells are similar, but not identical, to ES cells.</s></p><p><s>We examined the pluripotency of iPS cells by teratoma formation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S6</ref> and<ref type="table">Figure S3</ref>).</s><s>We obtained tumors with 5 iPS-MEF10 clones, 3 iPS-MEF4 clones, 1 iPS-MEF4wt clone, and 6 iPS-MEF3 clones after subcutaneous injection into nude mice.</s><s>Histological examination revealed that 2 iPS-MEF10 clones (3 and 6), 2 iPS-MEF4 clones (2 and 7), and the iPS-MEF4wt-4 clone differentiated into all three germ layers, including neural tissues, cartilage, and columnar epithelium.</s><s>iPS-MEF10-6 could give rise to all three germ layers even after 30 passages (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref> and<ref type="table">Figure S3</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed differentiation into neural and muscle tissues by immunostaining (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B</ref>) and RT-PCR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, these teratomas did not express the trophoblast marker Cdx2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>).</s><s>iPS-MEF10-1 tumors differentiated into ectoderm and endoderm, but not mesoderm, and no signs of differentiation were observed in tumors derived from the remaining iPS-MEF10 (7 and 10) or from iPS-MEF4-10.</s></p><p><s>These data demonstrate that the majority of, but not all, iPS-MEF10 and iPS-MEF4 clones exhibit pluripotency.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, all tumors derived from iPS-MEF3 clones were composed entirely of undifferentiated cells (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>Thus, although the three factors (Oct3/4, c-Myc, and Klf4) could induce the expression of some ES cell marker genes, they were not able to induce pluripotency.</s></p><p><s>iPS-MEF10, iPS-MEF4, and iPS-MEF3 cells formed embryoid bodies in noncoated plastic dishes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>When grown in tissue culture dishes, the embryoid bodies from iPS-MEF10 and iPS-MEF4 cells attached to the dish bottom and initiated differentiation.</s><s>After 3 days, immunostaining detected cells positive for a-smooth muscle actin (mesoderm marker), a-fetoprotein (endoderm marker), and bIII tubulin (ectoderm marker) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5D</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, embryoid bodies from iPS-MEF3 cells remained undifferentiated even when cultured in gelatin-coated dishes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>).</s><s>These data confirmed pluripotency of iPS-MEF10 and iPS-MEF4 and nullipotency of iPS-MEF3 in vitro.</s><s><ref type="table">S3-S5</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We next introduced the four selected factors into tail-tip fibroblasts (TTFs) of four 7-week-old male Fbx15 bgeo/bgeo mice on a C57/BL6-129 hybrid background.</s><s>We obtained 3 G418-resistant colonies, from each of which we could establish iPS cells (iPS-TTF4).</s><s>We also introduced the four factors into TTFs from a 12-week-old female Fbx15 bgeo/bgeo mouse, which also constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the CAG promoter and had a C57/BL6-129-ICR hybrid background.</s><s>Of the 13 G418-resistant colonies obtained, we isolated 6 clones from which we could establish iPS cells (iPS-TTFgfp4, clones 1-6).</s><s>In addition, we established another iPS-TTFgfp4 (clone 7), in which the cDNA for each of the four factors was flanked with two loxP sites in the transgene.</s><s>These cells were morphologically indistinguishable from ES cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>).</s><s>RT-PCR showed that clones 3 and 7 of iPS-TTFgfp4 expressed the majority of ES cell marker genes at high levels and the others at lower levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6B</ref>).</s><s>In another attempt, we used either the T58A mutant or the wild-type c-Myc for transduction and established 5 iPS-TTFgfp4 clones (clones 8-12) and 3 iPS-TTFgfp4wt clones (clones 1-3) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref>).</s><s>RT-PCR showed that iPS-TTFgfp4wt cells also expressed most of the ES cell marker genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We transplanted 2 iPS-TTF4 and 6 iPS-TTFgfp4 clones into nude mice, all of which produced tumors containing tissues of all three germ layers (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>We then introduced 2 clones of iPS-TTFgfp4 cells (clones 3 and 7) into C57/BL6 blastocysts by microinjection.</s><s>With iPS-TTFgfp4-3, we obtained 18 embryos at E13.5, 2 of which showed contribution of GFP-positive iPS cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref>).</s><s>Histological analyses confirmed that iPS cells contributed to all three germ layers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6D</ref>).</s><s>We observed GFP-positive cells in the gonad but could not determine whether they were germ cells or somatic cells.</s><s>With iPS-TTFgfp4-7, we obtained 22 embryos at E7.5, 3 of which were positive for GFP.</s><s>With the 2 clones, we had 27 pups born, but none of them were chimeric mice.</s><s>In addition, iPS-TTFgfp4 cells could differentiate into all three germ layers in vitro (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7</ref>).</s><s>These data demonstrate that the four selected factors could induce pluripotent cells from adult mouse fibroblast cultures.</s><s>We further characterized the expression of the four factors and others in iPS cells.</s><s>Real-time PCR confirmed that endogenous expression of Oct3/4 and Sox2 was lower in iPS cells than in ES cells (Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>However, the total amount of the four factors from the endogenous genes and the transgenes exceeded the normal expression levels in ES cells.</s><s>In contrast, Western blot analyses showed that the total protein amounts of the four factors in iPS cells were comparable to those in ES cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>We could detect Nanog and E-Ras proteins in iPS cells, but at lower levels than those in ES cells (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A</ref> and<ref

cells.</s><s>Surprisingly, Nanog is dispensable.</s><s>In addition, we identified c-Myc and Klf4 as essential factors.</s><s>These two tumor-related factors could not be replaced by other oncogenes including E-Ras, Tcl1, b-catenin, and Stat3 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The c-Myc protein has many downstream targets that enhance proliferation and transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adhikary and Eilers, 2005)</ref>, many of which may have roles in the generation of iPS cells.</s><s>Of note, c-Myc associates with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, including TRRAP, which is a core subunit of the TIP60 and GCN5 HAT complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McMahon et al., 1998)</ref>, CREB binding protein (CBP), and p300 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Vervoorts et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Within the mammalian genome, there may be up to 25,000 c-Myc binding sites <ref type="bibr"

target="#b21">Loh et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>c-Myc protein may induce global histone acetylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fernandez et al., 2003)</ref>, thus allowing Oct3/4 and Sox2 to bind to their specific target loci.</s></p><p><s>Klf4 has been shown to repress p53 directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rowland et al., 2005)</ref>, and p53 protein has been shown to suppress Nanog during ES cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lin et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>We found that iPS cells showed levels of p53 protein lower than those in MEFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A</ref>).</s><s>Thus, Klf4 might contribute to activation of Nanog and other ES cell-specific genes through p53 repression.</s><s>Alternatively, Klf4 might function as an inhibitor of Myc-induced apoptosis through the repression of p53 in our system <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Zindy et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, Klf4 activates p21 CIP1 , thereby suppressing cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Zhang et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>This antiproliferation function of Klf4 might be inhibited by c-Myc, which suppresses the expression of p21 CIP1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Seoane et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The balance between c-Myc and Klf4 may be important for the generation of iPS cells.</s></p><p><s>One question that remains concerns the origin of our iPS cells.</s><s>With our retroviral expression system, we estimated that only a small portion of cells expressing the four factors became iPS cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>).</s><s>The low frequency suggests that rare tissue stem/progenitor cells that coexisted in the fibroblast cultures might have given rise to the iPS cells.</s><s>Indeed, multipotent stem cells have been isolated from skin <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dyce et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Toma et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Toma et al., , 2005))</ref>.</s><s>These studies showed that 0.067% of mouse skin cells are stem cells.</s><s>One explanation for the low frequency of iPS cell derivation is that the four factors transform tissue stem cells.</s><s>However, we found that the four factors induced iPS cells with comparably low efficiency even from bone marrow stroma, which should be more enriched in mesenchymal stem cells and other multipotent cells (Tables <ref type="table">S2</ref> and<ref type="table">S6</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, cells induced by the three factors were nullipotent (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>DNA microarray analyses suggested that iPS-MEF4 cells and iPS-MEF3 cells have the same origin (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>These results do not favor multipotent tissue stem cells as the origin of iPS cells.</s></p><p><s>There are several other possibilities for the low frequency of iPS cell derivation.</s><s>First, the levels of the four factors required for generation of pluripotent cells may have narrow ranges, and only a small portion of cells expressing all four of the factors at the right levels can acquire ES cell-like properties.</s><s>Consistent with this idea, a mere 50% increase or decrease in Oct3/4 proteins induces differentiation of ES cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Niwa et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>iPS clones overexpressed the four factors when RNA levels were analyzed, but their protein levels were comparable to those in ES cells (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7B</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>), suggesting that the iPS clones possess a mechanism (or mechanisms) that tightly regulates the protein levels of the four factors.</s><s>We speculate that high amounts of the four factors are required in the initial stage of iPS cell generation, but, once they acquire ES cell-like status, too much of the factors are detrimental for self-renewal.</s><s>Only a small portion of transduced cells show such appropriate transgene expression.</s><s>Second, generation of pluripotent cells may require additional chromosomal alterations, which take place spontaneously during culture or are induced by some of the four factors.</s><s>Although the iPS-TTFgfp4 clones had largely normal karyotypes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7D</ref>), we cannot rule out the existence of minor chromosomal alterations.</s><s>Sitespecific retroviral insertion may also play a role.</s><s>Southern blot analyses showed that each iPS clone has 20 retroviral integrations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7C</ref>).</s><s>Some of these may have caused silencing or fusion with endogenous genes.</s><s>Further studies will be required to determine the origin of iPS cells.</s></p><p><s>Another unsolved question is whether the four factors we identified play roles in reprogramming induced by fusion with ES cells or nuclear transfer into oocytes.</s><s>Since the four factors are expressed in ES cells at high levels, it is reasonable to speculate that they are involved in the reprogramming machinery that exists in ES cells.</s><s>Our result is also consistent with the finding that the reprogramming activity resides in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm, of ES cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Do and Scholer, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>However, iPS cells were not identical to ES cells, as shown by the global gene-expression patterns and DNA methylation status.</s><s>It is possible that we have missed additional important factors.</s><s>One such candidate is ECAT1, although its forced expression in iPS cells did not consistently upregulate ES cell marker genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S12</ref>).</s></p><p><s>More obscure are the roles of the four factors, especially Klf4 and c-Myc, in the reprogramming observed in oocytes.</s><s>Both Klf4 and c-Myc are dispensable for preimplantation mouse development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baudino et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Katz et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, c-myc is not detected in oocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Domashenko et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, L-myc is expressed maternally in oocytes.</s><s>Klf17 and Klf7, but not Klf4, are found in expressed sequence-tag libraries derived from unfertilized mouse eggs.</s><s>Klf4 and c-Myc might be compensated by these related proteins.</s><s>It is highly likely that other factors are also required to induce complete reprogramming and totipotency in oocytes.</s></p><p><s>It is likely that the four factors from the transgenes are required for maintaining the iPS cells since the expression of Oct3/4 and Sox2 from the endogenous genes remained low (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7B</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>We intended to prove this by using transgenes flanked by two loxP sites and obtained an iPS clone (TTF4gfp4-7).</s><s>However, we noticed that these cells contain multiple loxP sites on multiple chromosomes, and, thus, the Cre-mediated recombination would cause not only deletion of the transgenes but also interand intrachromosomal rearrangements.</s><s>Studies with conditional expression systems, such as the tetracyclinemediated system, are required to answer this question.</s></p><p><s>We showed that the iPS cells can differentiate in vitro and in vivo even with the presence of the retroviral vectors containing the four factors.</s><s>We found that Oct3/4 and Sox2 proteins decreased significantly during in vitro differentiation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7B</ref>).</s><s>Retroviral expression has been shown to be suppressed in ES cells and further silenced upon differentiation by epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Yao et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>The same mechanisms are likely to play roles in transgene repression in iPS cells since they express Dnmt3a, 3b, and 3l, albeit at lower levels than ES cells do (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we found that iPS cells possess a mechanism (or mechanisms) that lowers protein levels of the transgenes and Nanog (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7B</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>The same mechanism may be enhanced during differentiation.</s><s>However, silencing of Oct3/4 in iPS-TTFgfp4-3 cells was not complete, which may explain our inability to obtain live chimeric mice after blastocyst microinjection of iPS cells.</s></p><p><s>An unexpected finding in this study was the efficient activation of Fgf4 and Fbx15 by the combination of the three factors devoid of Sox2 since these two genes have been shown to be regulated synergistically by Oct3/4 and Sox2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tokuzawa et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yuan et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>It is also surprising that Nanog is dispensable for induction and maintenance of iPS cells.</s><s>More detailed analyses of iPS cells will enhance our understanding of transcriptional regulation in pluripotent stem cells.</s></p><p><s>Our findings may have wider applications, as we have found that transgene reporters with other ES cell marker genes, such as Nanog, can replace the Fbx15 knockin during selection (K.</s><s>Okita and S.Y., unpublished data).</s><s>However, we still do not know whether the four factors can generate pluripotent cells from human somatic cells.</s><s>Use of c-Myc may not be suitable for clinical applications, and the process may require specific culture environments.</s><s>Nevertheless, the finding is an important step in controlling pluripotency, which may eventually allow the creation of pluripotent cells directly from somatic
