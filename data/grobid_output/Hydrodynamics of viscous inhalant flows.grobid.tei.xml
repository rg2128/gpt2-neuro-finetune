<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Numerical methods</head><p><s>Numerical simulations were performed via finite element discretization of the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations (Eqs.</s><s>5 and 6).</s><s>Because the flow is driven entirely by a boundary condition of constant volumetric flowrate at the tube outlet, gravity plays no dynamical role and acts only to superimpose a hydrostatic pressure gradient.</s><s>For this reason, we do not include gravity in the the finite element model formulation.</s><s>The COM-SOL Multiphysics package was used to generate the mesh and to solve the system of equations resulting from the weak (integral) form discretization of the governing equations.</s><s>The mesh contained triangular and quadrilateral elements with local refinement around solid surfaces (inhalant tube walls and impermeable bottom bed).</s><s>A mesh refinement study was performed to test for solution convergence throughout the domain.</s><s>We iterated to finer meshes (increasing model degrees of freedom) until the total relative error estimate summed over all elements and degrees of freedom was of order 1e-11, and there was no discernible change in the solution with further grid refinement.</s><s>The final mesh implemented had typical maximum and minimum element sizes (spatial resolution) of approximately 0.075D and 0.01D, respectively.</s><s>In addition to the mesh refinement study, we also validated the model experimentally as discussed in detail below.</s></p><p><s>Lagrangian (polynomial) shape functions (basis functions) were implemented for weak form discretization of the fluid velocity (second order) and pressure (first order) fields; the second-order velocity shape functions are appropriate for the low flow velocities in the exterior laminar flow approaching the inlet orifice <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The order of the numerical integration scheme was matched to the order of the element (shape function) for each dependent variable.</s><s>The time discretization scheme was an implicit backward differentiation formula (BDF) method with maximum second order schemes, balancing numerical stability and damping tendencies for our gradually varying flows with smooth gradients.</s><s>BDF methods use variable-order, variable step-size backward differentiation and are known for their stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>Time stepping was thus adaptive and the variable step size taken by the solver was informed by a prescribed absolute tolerance for the nonlinear solver and an implicit formulation of the mesh Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number.</s><s>The nonlinear systems of equations were solved using the direct PARDISO solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, a solver optimized for par-allelized solution of sparse systems of equations.</s></p><p><s>Initial conditions were zero velocity and pressure everywhere, u * = 0 and p * = 0.</s><s>The inhalant tube walls and the bottom bed were impermeable, no slip conditions, u * = 0.

RESULTS</head><p><s>Principal aims of this study are to characterize the exterior flow field of inhalant flows, to understand transient development of these flows, and to quantify the initial spatial distribution of subsequently inhaled fluid.</s><s>First, the long-time behavior beyond the time scale of rapid transient development is presented in order to identify basic features of the flow field.</s><s>Next, the transient response is investigated by tracking the time evolution of a region of influence (RoI) of the flow.</s><s>We define RoIs at any instant in time as the volume of fluid bounded by a particular velocity magnitude contour.</s><s>Lastly, fluid inhalation volumes are quantified as a function of inhalation period.</s><s>Results are presented for Re = 1, 10, and 100, and at extraction heights h * = 0 ("bed-flush"), h * = 2 ("near-bed"), and h * = 40 ("unbounded").</s><s>In the bed-flush geometry (h * = 0, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), flow consists of radial inflow towards the inlet orifice for all Re.</s><s>Inflow magnitude decays rapidly with distance from the inlet orifice in a manner reminiscent of a sink flow.</s><s>At different Re, subtle flow differences are evidenced in the size and shape of the RoIs.</s><s>The no-slip condition along the bottom bed gives rise to a thicker boundary layer at lower Re, flattening the 1% RoI near the bed.</s><s>At low Re, this bottom boundary layer retards lateral inflow, causing preferential vertical inflow along the z-axis.</s><s>At high Re, thinning of the bottom boundary layer permits more omnidirectional inflow.</s><s>Directional flow bias at lower Re alters the aspect ratio of the RoIs.</s><s>For Re = 1, the RoIs show elongation along the z-axis.</s><s>This effect is somewhat mitigated at Re = 10 (middle panel) and at Re = 100 (right panel) the RoIs are very nearly hemispherical.</s><s>As the most inviscid flow modeled, the Re = 100 case most closely resembles a sink flow in which the velocity contours would conform to hemispherical potential lines.</s></p><p><s>Increasing extraction height to h * = 2 (near-bed case, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) results in structural changes to the flow field, particularly at low Re.</s><s>At high Reynolds number (Re = 100, right panel), there is once again radial inflow to the orifice, that now includes fluid from below.</s><s>At Re = 1 and 10 (left and middle panels), however, the flow bifurcates and some entrained fluid now bypasses the orifice and continues downward along the exterior, inhalant tube wall and radially outwards along the bottom bed.</s><s>Demarcation between inhaled and bypassed fluid is a stagnation streamline that terminates on the rim of the inlet orifice, as shown in the figure (here and elsewhere we denote stagnation streamlines as dashed gray lines).</s><s>Flow velocities associated with fluid that bypasses the orifice manifest as a lobe of the 1% RoI extending below the orifice.</s><s>Impact of viscous entrainment is largest at the lowest Reynolds number (Re = 1, left panel), increasing the amount of bypassed fluid with a corresponding increase in size of the 1% RoI lobe.</s><s>Enhanced effects of viscous diffusion at low Re are also evident in the overall increase in spatial extent of the 1% RoI.</s><s>Conversely, in the most inviscid flow case (Re = 100, right panel), inward advection of momentum dominates outward viscous diffusion, and the flow reverts once again to a state suggestive of an inviscid sink flow with radial inflow and nearly spherical RoIs.</s></p><p><s>For the unbounded geometry (h * = 40, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), the influence of the bottom bed is effectively eliminated.</s><s>As in the h * = 2 geometry, the Re = 1 and 10 flows (left and middle panels) bifurcate and some entrained fluid bypasses the orifice and is recirculated outwards.</s><s>As before, the stagnation streamline (dashed line) separates inhaled and bypassed fluid.</s><s>For Re = 1, viscous diffusion causes the extent of the flow field to be greatly expanded.</s><s>In fact, as we show later, the transient development for this viscous case continues indefinitely.</s><s>These amplified diffusive effects are evidenced by substantial enlargement of the RoIs relative to the previous two geometries.</s><s>Increased viscous entrainment of fluid also increases the size of the 1% RoI lobe of bypassed fluid.</s><s>In the absence of the nearby bottom bed, the deflection of the lobe laterally away from the inhalant tube is reduced.</s><s>The Re = 10 unbounded case (middle panel) is surprisingly similar to the corresponding near-bed case.</s><s>Finally, in the most inviscid case (Re = 100, right panel), inward advection dominates outward diffusion and the flow field is once again trapped in a state reminiscent of an unbounded sink flow with nearly spherical RoIs.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Inhalation volumes</head><p><s>Here, we investigate the initial spatial distribution of fluid that is subsequently ingested into the inhalant tube.</s><s>We represent these inhalation volumes by their bounding envelopes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>).</s><s>These volumes were computed with inhalation beginning at t * = 100 (corresponding to the long-time behavior of the flow) and proceeding for inhalation durations ∆t * = 1, 10, and 100.</s><s>An inhalation duration ∆t * = 1 corresponds to the time required to inhale a characteristic volume ((πD 3 )/(4Q)) -this is equivalent to a cylinder with diameter and length equal to D. Sizes of inhalant volumes for a given nondimensional inhalation duration ∆t * are therefore identical (regardless of Re or h * ).</s><s>That is, all blue (dark gray) envelopes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>  gible over the inhalation durations used.</s><s>For cases that have a stagnation streamline (four lower-left panels, see also Figs. <ref type="figure">5,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), a portion of the inhalation volume envelope along the bottom coincides with this streamline (shown with a dashed line).</s><s>Fluid below this streamline is recirculated outwards and can never enter the orifice.</s><s>In contrast, for the h * = 0 (top row) and for Re = 100 (right column) cases, all flow is radially inward, and as ∆t * → ∞ the envelopes expand to fill the entire domain.</s></p><p><s>Inhalant volumes show strong directional bias as a function of not only Re (columns) but also extraction height h * (rows) and depart significantly from what would be predicted by potential flow theory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>).</s><s>For the most viscous case (Re = 1, left column), increasing h * shifts inhalant volumes up towards the axis of the inhalant tube, producing directional inhalation.</s><s>Conversely, for the most inviscid case (Re = 100, right column), we see the exact opposite: increasing h * now enables a more omnidirectional inhalation.</s><s>For the in-termediate case (Re = 10, middle column), the shape of the inhalation volume is relatively insensitive to h * .</s><s>The most striking departure from potential flow theory occurs at Re = 1 and h * = 40 (lower-left panel).</s><s>For this viscous case, downward momentum from the directional flow in the inhalant tube diffuses readily throughout the exterior domain.</s><s>In the absence of a nearby bed, this diffusion activates a systemic downward flow (see left panel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), much of which must bypass the orifice (as evidenced by the upward deflection of the stagnation streamline).</s><s>This produces a conical inhalation volume that samples preferentially from above.</s><s>Overall, the choice of Re and h * is seen to have profound impact on the spatial distribution of inhaled fluid.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SUMMARY</head><p><s>Potential flow theory has been historically used to approximate flows approaching an orifice as inviscid sink flows.</s><s>However, many inhalant flows are not welldescribed by potential flow theory because they are subject to boundary conditions that are both directional and spatially distributed, and their development is influ-enced by viscous diffusion of momentum.</s><s>In this study we characterized transient hydrodynamics of impulsivelystarted, laminar inhalant flows approaching an orifice for a range of Reynolds numbers (to vary the influence of viscous effects) and extraction heights (to vary the influence of the solid bed).</s><s>The increasing importance of viscosity at lower Re is evidenced in our results by significant departures from potential flow theory.</s><s>For all Re, the flow at t * 1 is sink-like, representing the inviscid, elliptic response.</s><s>For high Re, the flow remains relatively similar to the sink flow for all times.</s><s>At lower Re, increased viscous effects entrain an evergrowing volume of fluid, and the flow continues to develop indefinitely.</s><s>In some cases, flows at lower Re spatially bifurcate causing some fluid to be inhaled and other fluid to bypass the orifice.</s><s>The demarcation line between inhaled and bypassed fluid is a stagnation streamline that terminates on the rim of the orifice.</s><s>The viscous, diffusive effects seen at lower Re are further enhanced with increasing extraction height, whereas the higher Re flows remain trapped in a sink-like state regardless of h * .</s></p><p><s>The structural changes in the fluid inhalation volumes as a function of Re and h * are analogous to those in the RoIs.</s><s>For lower Re, increasing h * shifts inhalant volumes towards the axis of the inhalant tube, producing more directional inhalation.</s><s>In contrast, at higher Re, increasing h * has the opposite effect and produces a more omnidirectional inhalation.</s><s>Strong directional bias in inhalation as a function of Re and h * could be exploited by organisms and engineers alike to achieve specific inhalation criteria.</s><s>For example, a bottom-dwelling, siphon-feeding organism might decrease its pumping Re and increase its tube height to sample more directionally from above and inhale food-and oxygen-rich fluid volumes farther removed from the bottom bed.</s><s>However, this pumping regime will also produce the greatest spatial extent of the region of influence of the flow, perhaps making the organism more detectable to nearby predators.</s><s>Similarly, engineers and scientists may require fluid samplers capable of both isotropic and anisotropic sampling regimes depending on environmental conditions or design criteria; this could be achieved by adjusting Reynolds number and extraction height to suit sampling needs of a specific application.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIG. 1.
