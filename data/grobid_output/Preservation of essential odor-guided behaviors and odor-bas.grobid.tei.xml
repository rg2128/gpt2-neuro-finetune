-85% of baseline weight, mice were acclimated to the go/no-go operant boxes.</s><s>Mice were singlehoused for all behavioral procedures, and all testing occurred during the light phase of the cycle (0900 to 1800).</s><s>All behavior was carried out in a dimly lit, wellventilated room at 20 -22°C.</s></p><p><s>We used three custom-built go/no-go operant chambers designed based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bodyak and Slotnick (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Slotnick and Restrepo (2001)</ref>.</s><s>The chambers were constructed of quarter-inch-thick acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic and custom 3D-printed [polylactic acid (PLA)] nose-poke ports.</s><s>The inner dimension of the chamber was 6 ϫ 6 inches, with 11-inch-tall walls.</s><s>On one wall was an operant plate consisting of two holes housing the two nose-poke ports (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The nose-poke ports were three-quarter-inch inner diameter and were positioned 2 inches apart (center to center); each was 1.25 inches above the chamber floor (from floor to center of port).</s><s>On another wall of the operant chamber was a hinged door allowing placement and removal of the mice.</s></p><p><s>The chambers were open-top (no ceiling), to facilitate air circulation.</s><s>The top of the odor port terminated into a flexible air hose (1-inch diameter) which was connected to a 12-V computer fan, which drew air from within the chamber (through the poke hole) up through the fan.</s><s>An infrared LED and infrared photodetector were placed ϳ2 mm into each port to provide continuous measures of port entry (beam interruption).</s><s>The chambers were each housed in a single wooden enclosure box with an 8-inchwide 12-V computer fan on one wall of the enclosure and a vent hole on the other to ensure that air could freely circulate throughout the chamber and facilitate odor elimination from within.</s><s>All valves, computer hardware, and odor vials were housed outside of the enclosure boxes, which were positioned on a stainless steel rack.</s></p><p><s>Odor solenoid valves (Parker Hannifin, Cleveland, OH) and reward pinch valves (NResearch, West Caldwell, NJ) were controlled by custom code written in Tucker-Davis Technologies software (Alachua, FL), which gated voltage through a relay driver module (LabJack Corp., Lakewood, CO).</s><s>The status of the infrared nose-poke beams as well as valve activity (odor or reward) was relayed into a digital processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies) and acquired to a computer at 3 kHz sampling rate.</s></p><p><s>Mice were shaped in the go/no-go task across four phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bodyak and Slotnick, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Slotnick and Restrepo, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In phase 1, upon nose-poke into the odor port (in absence of odor), the mice were allowed to withdraw and then nose-poke into the reward port in exchange for the water reward (ϳ3 l).</s><s>For the first two blocks of this, to facilitate task acquisition, the nose poke into the odor port automatically triggered water reward release, without the need for the animal to even poke within the reward port.</s><s>Throughout phase 1, the duration required for the mouse to hold its nose in the port (break the beam) was gradually increased from 200 to 600 ms in 200-ms increments.</s><s>Thus, by the end of phase 1, the mouse must be holding its nose in the odor port for 600 ms.</s><s>Upon achieving Ն85% correct responses in two consecutive blocks of 20 trials (criterion performance), the mice were switched into phase 2 of training.</s><s>In phase 2, the mice were required to nosepoke for 600 ms and then sustain the poke for an additional 200 ms, during which time a conditioned reward odor (CSϩ) was delivered (800 ms total hold requirement).</s><s>The CSϩ odor was delivered in all trials in which the animal held its nose in the port for Ն600 ms.</s><s>The mice were then gradually required to increase their hold duration to remain with their noses in the port for 400 ms of CSϩ odor presentation (1000 ms total hold requirement).</s><s>Upon achieving criterion performance on phase 2, mice were transitioned to phase 3, wherein they had to detect the CSϩ odor trials versus blank stimulus trials, in which reward delivery in the reward port occurred only upon nose pokes into this port preceded by CSϩ.</s><s>During both trials, total hold duration was 1000 ms (600 ms, followed by 400-ms stimulus).</s><s>Withdrawal from the odor port and poking in the reward port during CSϩ trials resulted in a water reward.</s><s>Upon achieving criterion performance on phase 3, mice were transitioned to phase 4 and shaped on the odor discrimination task.</s><s>In this, the mice were again required to nose poke in the odor port for a minimum of 1000 ms (600 ms, followed by 400-ms stimulus).</s><s>Withdrawal from the odor port and poking in the reward port during CSϩ trials resulted in a water reward (hit).</s><s>Delivery of CSϩ but failure to poke in the reward port within 5 s was counted as an error (miss).</s><s>Delivery of a conditioned nonrewarded odor (CS-) and failure to poke in the reward port within 5 s was counted as a correct reject.</s><s>Finally, delivery of a CS-followed by poking in the reward port within 5 s was counted as a false alarm.</s><s>The percentage of correct responses (hits and correct rejects vs. misses and false alarms) was determined for each block of 20 trials.</s><s>During phase 4, a minimum 5-s intertrial interval was enforced.</s><s>Mice were not cued to nose poke but instead were able to self-initiate trials by nose poking beyond the boundaries of the intertrial interval.</s><s>The intertrial interval could thus be reset after completion of new trials or because of "short samples," wherein the animal failed to maintain nose poke for the required duration.</s><s>All mice con-tributing complete phase 4 data in the study were required to complete the same number of blocks (100 Ϯ 5) before going onto the reversal learning task.</s><s>During the reversal task, the behavioral contingencies for the CSϩ and CS-were switched so that the previous CSis now a CSϩ (rewarded) and vice versa.</s></p><p><s>After reversal learning tests, the mice were required to perform in six blocks at or above criterion level (85%) before engagement in the odor-discrimination self-regulation task, wherein they were mandated to nose poke for only 600 ms and continue to nose poke for 50 ms of odor.</s><s>In this overall testing structure, all mice needed to reach and demonstrate consistent criterion levels of behavior before being transitioned into the subsequent tasks.</s></p><p><s>Finally, after all olfactory testing, the mice were tested for water motivation on the next day.</s><s>For water motivation tests, mice were placed in the operant chambers for 1 h,

learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Furr et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Nilsson et al., 2012)</ref>, perhaps a near-complete absence of forebrain 5-HT has a net counterbalancing effect on reversal learning.</s><s>A similar explanation may account for the lack of effect of adult brain Tph2 targeting on olfaction.</s><s>With respect to reversal learning outcomes, however, this explanation does not account for the discrepancy between our findings and earlier ones in which 5-HT was also broadly depleted from the forebrain and therefore would have been expected to impact 5-HT signaling through more than one 5-HT receptor subtype.</s><s>A conspicuous difference between our study and earlier ones, however, is the method used to deplete brain 5-HT.</s><s>In contrast to our viral/genetic approach, previous studies have used pharmacological or dietary means to reduce brain 5-HT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Clarke et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clarke et al., , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Clarke et al., ,2007;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Masaki et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr"

et al., , 2016))</ref>.</s><s>Although off-target pharmacological effects are not potentially inherent in our Tph2 targeting approach, we cannot rule out the possibility that the severe deficiency of brain 5-HT in Tph2 conditional knockout mice lasting several weeks before behavioral testing may have triggered presently unknown secondary effects, such as homeostatic alterations in the function of other transmitter systems, that compensate for the absence of 5-HT modulation of olfactory synaptic circuitry.</s><s>Further parallel investigations of cognitive flexibility with adult Tph2-targeted mice and traditional methods of 5-HT depletion are needed to resolve the mechanistic basis of previously reported effects, which, our results suggest, are not directly due to altered 5-HT levels.</s></p><p><s>Our findings prompt the question as to what role 5-HT does play in olfaction.</s><s>Why do the essential olfactory structures receive massive 5-HT innervation if not for even adjusting the most essential functioning of the system?</s><s>One possibility is that 5-HT is needed only for the more nuanced aspects of odor-guided behavior, including the discrimination of structurally similar odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cleland et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Uchida and Mainen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abraham et al.,

type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wojcik and Sirotin, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, a mouse may need 5-HT to discern the difference of odor in a sexually receptive female mouse versus an unreceptive one, yet may not need 5-HT to recognize the scent difference between a mouse and a predator.</s><s>It is also possible that the influence of 5-HT would manifest only in cases of changes in behavioral state, including startle, arousal, or hunger.</s><s>Nevertheless, our results, that the essential functions of the mammalian olfactory system can persevere despite a near-complete absence of adult brain 5-HT, are striking and suggest need for a refinement of models wherein 5-HT serves a major role in the olfactory system.</s></p><p><s>Instead, we may benefit from recognizing a far more limited role of 5-HT in olfactory system function and perception.</s><s>Further, this work provides a foundation to probe for compensatory synaptic mechanisms whereby our olfactory system may engage in informing behaviors, including those involving transmitter corelease <ref type="bibr">(Trudeau, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Zhou et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barker
