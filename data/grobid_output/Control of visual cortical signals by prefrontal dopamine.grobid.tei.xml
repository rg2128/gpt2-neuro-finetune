.</s><s>To test our hypothesis, we locally infused <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> small volumes (0.5-1 µL) of SCH23390 into sites within the FEF of monkeys performing fixation and eye movement tasks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We measured the effects of the FEF infusion on target selection using a free-choice, saccade task <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>In this task, monkeys were rewarded for choosing between two saccadic targets, one located within the FEF RF and one in the opposite hemifield.</s><s>In the same experiment, we recorded the visual responses of single neurons within extrastriate area V4 during fixation.</s><s>In particular, we recorded neurons with RFs that overlapped the FEF RF .</s><s>Thus, we tested the effects of the D1R manipulation both on visual cortical signals and on saccadic target selection.</s></p><p><s>We found that altering D1R-mediated activity at FEF sites increased the tendency of monkeys to choose targets appearing within the FEF RF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>In the free choice task, the temporal onset of the two targets was systematically varied such that the FEF RF stimulus could appear earlier or later than the opposite stimulus.</s><s>The monkey's tendency to select the FEF RF target could then be measured as the temporal onset asynchrony required for equal probability of selecting either stimulus; we termed this the point of equal selection (PES).</s><s>In the example experiment shown, the monkey chose the FEF RF target as often as the opposite target when the former appeared 76 ms earlier (PES=76).</s><s>However, infusion of SCH23390 (0.85 µL) into the FEF reduced the PES by 23 ms (binary logistic regression, p=0.007), thereby increasing the proportion of FEF RF target choices.</s></p><p><s>In the same experiment, we also measured the responses of V4 neurons to oriented bars during fixation in a separate task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, Supplementary methods).</s><s>We found that the increase in target selection following the SCH23390 infusion was accompanied by an enhanced V4 neuronal response to oriented bars appearing within the overlapping V4 RF and FEF RF .</s><s>The example neuron shown was selective for orientation; it responded more to the 45° than to the 135° bar stimulus (p&lt;10 -3 ).</s><s>Following the infusion of SCH23390, there was not only a significant increase in the overall visual response of this neuron, but also a significant increase in the differential response to the two orientations (Two-way ANOVA, SCH23390 effect, p&lt;10 -3 ; SCH23390-orientation interaction, p&lt;10 -3 ).</s><s>Thus, the local perturbation of D1R-mediated FEF activity not only caused the monkey to select FEF RF stimuli as saccade targets more frequently, but it also led to enhanced and more selective visual responses of a V4 neuron representing the same part of space.</s></p><p><s>We studied the visual responses of 37 V4 neurons with RFs that overlapped the RFs of FEF infusion sites.</s><s>The average (mean±SEM) distance between V4 RF and FEF RF centers was 0.71±0.07</s><s>degrees of visual angle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>As with the example neuron, we measured the responses of all neurons to oriented bars appearing in their RF during a 1-second fixation period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Prior to onset of the visual stimulus, there was a significant elevation in baseline activity following the D1R manipulation (Δbaseline=0.077±0.186,</s><s>p=0.030).</s><s>In addition to the baseline increase, the visually driven response of V4 neurons was enhanced by 17% above the control response (Δresponse=0.121±0.054,</s><s>p=0.018).</s><s>We confirmed that the enhancement in the visual response was not due to systematic changes in eye position during stimulus presentation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The enhancement of the visual response was independently significant for both preferred (Δpreferred=0.264±0.087;</s><s>p=0.004) and for non-preferred stimuli (Δnon-preferred=0.132±0.062;</s><s>p=0.032).</s><s>In addition, there was an increase in the response difference between the preferred and non-preferred orientations (Δresponse difference=0.132±0.041;</s><s>p=0.004) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), suggesting an increase in orientation selectivity.</s><s>To measure selectivity more quantitatively, we used a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to quantify the degree to which each neuron's responses could be used to judge stimulus orientation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>This analysis confirmed that V4 neurons were more orientation selective following changes in D1Rmediated FEF activity (ΔROC area=0.035±0.009,</s><s>p&lt;10 -3 ).</s><s>The enhancement in V4 response magnitude and selectivity was accompanied by a decrease in the trial-to-trial variability of visual responses.</s><s>We measured the variability of V4 responses across trials by computing the Fano factor (FF), which is the variance in the spike count divided by its mean.</s><s>We found that the FF of V4 responses was reduced after the D1R manipulation (ΔFF=-0.105±0.045;</s><s>p&lt;10 -3 )(Fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>)(Supplementary Fig.

signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The effect of the D1R manipulation on saccadic target selection was highly consistent across the two monkeys tested.</s><s>Of 21 double-target experiments, the PES was reduced in every case (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The mean PES shifted in favor of the FEF RF stimulus by an average of 27 ms (ΔPES=-26.934±3.086,</s><s>p&lt;10 -3 ), significantly increasing the overall proportion of FEF RF choices (Chi-square=80.60,</s><s>p&lt;10 -3 ), thus indicating that the D1R manipulation increased the monkeys' tendency to target FEF RF stimuli.</s><s>The increase in target selection was apparent across a range of drug dosages (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>In addition to the D1R manipulation, we tested the effects of the D2R-agonist quinpirole.</s><s>Previous studies using this drug found that it does not affect persistent activity, but rather increases saccade-related activity within dorsolateral PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>We found that, like the D1R effect, local manipulation of D2R-mediated FEF activity increased the selection of FEF RF targets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The PES shifted an average of 22 ms (ΔPES=-21.993±6.758,</s><s>p=0.010), increasing the proportion of FEF RF choices (Chi-square= 13.86, p&lt;10 -3 ).</s><s>Thus, the D1R and D2R-mediated manipulations of FEF activity resulted in equivalent increases in saccadic target selection.</s></p><p><s>In spite of the increase in target selection, manipulation of D2R-mediated activity in FEF failed to enhance the responses of V4 neurons.</s><s>We found no significant effect on the visual response magnitude, orientation selectivity or response variability of V4 neurons following the D2R manipulation (Δresponse=0.001±0.048,</s><s>p=0.999;</s><s>ΔROC area=-0.007±0.010,</s><s>p=0.426;</s><s>ΔFF=0.037±0.052,</s><s>p=0.338; n=15) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the changes in these measures were all significantly different from the changes we observed with the D1R manipulation (Δresponse D2R &lt;Δresponse D1R , p=0.045; Δselectivity D2R &lt;Δ selectivity D1R , p=0.011; ΔFF D2R &gt; ΔFF D1R , p=0.019).</s><s>Thus, the equivalent effects of D1R and D2R on saccadic target selection were accompanied by contrasting effects in V4, in which the enhancement of visual signals was specific to D1R-mediated activity.</s></p><p><s>We also found that the enhancement of visual signals following the D1R manipulation was confined to V4 neurons with RFs that overlapped the FEF RF .</s><s>For V4 neurons with RFs that did not overlap the FEF RF (mean distance between V4 RF and FEF RF =9.00±0.86</s><s>d.v.a.; n=15), we found no significant effect of the D1R manipulation on response magnitude (Δresponse=-0.028±0.087,</s><s>p=0.9780), orientation selectivity (ΔROCarea=-0.017±0.010,</s><s>p=0.187) or the FF (ΔFF=0.010±0.043,</s><s>p=.688).</s><s>Importantly, the changes in these measures were all significantly different from the changes observed in neurons with overlapping RFs (Δresponse non-overlap .&lt;Δresponse</s><s>overlap , p=0.044; Δselectivity non-overlap &lt;Δselectivity overlap , p=0.007; ΔFF non-overlap &gt;ΔFF overlap , p=0.034) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the enhancement in visual cortical signaling produced by the manipulation of D1R-mediated FEF activity was spatially specific.</s></p><p><s>We also tested the effects of complete inactivation of FEF sites on the responses of V4 neurons with overlapping RFs.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that local inactivation of the FEF disrupts saccadic target selection and impairs attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>We therefore wondered if inactivation could reduce the components of V4 responses that were enhanced by the D1R manipulation.</s><s>We locally inactivated FEF sites with the GABA A agonist muscimol.</s><s>Unlike the sparsely localized D1Rs, GABA A receptors are widely expressed by all neurons in all cortical layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>As in previous studies, local inactivation of FEF sites with muscimol decreased the targeting of FEF RF stimuli.</s><s>FEF inactivation also significantly reduced V4 orientation selectivity (ΔROC area=-0.030±0.011,</s><s>p=0.003; n=33).</s><s>However, the inactivation did not change the response magnitude or variability of V4 neurons (Δresponse= 0.016±0.061,</s><s>p=0.809;</s><s>ΔFF=-0.002±0.023,</s><s>p=0.921) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, in contrast to the D1R manipulation, which altered all 3 components of V4 activity, complete inactivation altered only one.</s><s>All 3 inactivation effects were significantly different from the D1R effects (Δresponse muscimol &lt;Δresponse D1R , p=0.024; Δselectivity muscimol &lt;Δselectivity D1R , p&lt;10 -3 ; ΔFF muscimol &gt;ΔFF D1R , p=0.007).</s><s>Although the reduction in orientation selectivity is consistent with previous electrical microstimulation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , and with the effects of inactivation on orientation discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , the lack of a reduction in response magnitude may seem less congruent.</s><s>However, we suggest that this difference is due to variation between experimental paradigms (Supplemental discussion).</s><s>Finally, we tested for any effects of vehicle (saline) infusions into the FEF.</s><s>The infusion of saline failed to change the response magnitude, selectivity or variability of V4 neurons (Δresponse= 0.018±0.048,</s><s>p=0.380;</s><s>ΔROC area=-0.010±0.013,</s><s>p=0.569;</s><s>ΔFF= -0.035±0.061,</s><s>p=0.179; n=12) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>All 3 measures were significantly different from the D1R effects (Δresponse saline &lt;Δresponse D1R , p=0.045; Δselectivity saline &lt;Δselectivity D1R , p=0.013; ΔFF saline &gt;ΔFF D1R , p=0.009).</s></p><p><s>Our results identify prefrontal D1Rs as a component of the neural circuitry controlling signals within visual cortex.</s><s>Manipulation of D1R-mediated FEF activity was sufficient to enhance the magnitude, reliability and visual selectivity of neuronal responses within area V4, three known effects of visual attention.</s><s>The observed enhancement might account for the benefits in visually guided behavior that accompany attentional deployment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), though a causal link between attentional modulation of visual cortical signals and visual perception remains to be established.</s><s>Our results demonstrate how visual representations within posterior areas can be altered merely by changes in dopamine tone within the PFC.</s><s>Given the complex effects of dopamine through D1Rs, one might predict that at "optimum" dopamine levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , optimal effects of top-down control of visual cortical signals, would be achieved.</s></p><p><s>The circuitry underlying top-down control of visual cortex likely involves a number of different neuromodulators e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>and an array of different brain structures e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>.</s><s>Our results show that this circuitry involves prefrontal dopamine acting via D1Rs.</s><s>Within dorsolateral PFC, dopamine D1Rs are thought to modulate recurrent glutamatergic connections, thereby influencing working memory related activity in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>The present results suggest that D1Rs contribute to the FEF's control of visual signals by an analogous mechanism, namely by modulating (long-range) recurrent connections between the FEF and visual cortex (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Since superficial layer FEF neurons are reciprocally connected with neurons in V4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , dopaminergic modulation of these connections via superficial layer D1Rs would be expected to mediate the FEF's control of V4 signals.</s><s>The specificity of V4 effects to D1Rs, rather than D2Rs, might be explained by the relative absence of D2Rs in superficial layers of prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> .</s><s>The equivalent target selection effects of D1R and D2R

type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , where layer V FEF neurons project to the superior colliculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, impairments in saccadic control are prominent among the set of impairments exhibited in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>The observed influence of prefrontal D1Rs on saccadic target selection and visual cortical signals, combined with their known influence on persistent activity, may explain the behavioral links between saccadic control, attention and working
