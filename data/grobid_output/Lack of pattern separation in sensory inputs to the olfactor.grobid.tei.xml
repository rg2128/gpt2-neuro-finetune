<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Recent studies have revealed changes in mitral cell responses during discrimination learning paradigms.</s><s>In particular, the learning to discriminate between very similar odorants led to an enhanced pattern separation in mitral cell responses, potentially underlying the perceptual learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abraham et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chu et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we explored whether the mitral cell changes may be inherited from changes in OSN inputs to the bulb.</s><s>However, the separation of odor responses of OSN inputs remained stable during the same week-long learning paradigm that induced an enhanced separation of mitral cell responses, suggesting that plasticity during this task occurs downstream of OSN input onto mitral cells.</s></p><p><s>We acknowledge that several previous studies have demonstrated changes in the glomerular activity during olfactory experiences.</s><s>For example, week-long passive exposure to a single odorant resulted in a temporal divergence in OSN odorant responses (measured by the fluorescence of synaptopHluorin expressed in OSN axons) to a novel pair of similar odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kass et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, fear conditioning has been demonstrated to result in the potentiation of the response to the paired odorant <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kass et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, after odor-reward association learning, OSN responses to the trained odorants, which were monitored by intrinsic signal imaging, were shown to be potentiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abraham et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>We did not observe these changes in OSN activity.</s><s>The source of this potential discrepancy is unclear and may be due to differences in behavioral contexts (including task difficulty and trial parameters), measurement methods (our GCaMP6s imaging vs synaptopHluorin signals or intrinsic signal imaging), choice of odorants used, etc.</s><s>Nevertheless, in this and previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chu et al., 2016)</ref>, we have compared the changes in OSN activity and mitral cell activity during the same behavioral task with the same odorants, providing a strong case for plasticity downstream of OSN inputs.</s><s>We also note that our results do not exclude the potential contribution of changes in OSN activity that are not detected by our current method, such as changes in millisecond-level spike synchrony across OSNs, although it seems unlikely that such changes account for the entirety of the enhanced pattern separation observed in mitral cells.</s></p><p><s>There are many possible sites downstream of OSN input which could result in the changes in mitral cell activity during perceptual learning.</s><s>For example, mitral cell activity is shaped by local inhibitory neurons, and plasticity in inhibitory connections could contribute to the enhanced pattern separation of mitral cell responses.</s><s>Interestingly, thousands of newly generated inhibitory interneurons are integrated into the olfactory circuitry daily through adult neurogenesis, which provides an additional layer of inhibitory plasticity in the olfactory bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alonso et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the olfactory bulb receives ample feedback projections from higher brain centers.</s><s>Cortical glutamatergic feedback, which mainly target inhibitory interneurons in the olfactory bulb, indirectly modulates mitral cell activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balu et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boyd et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Markopoulos et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Otazu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mazo et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, feedback from various neuromodulatory areas can shape mitral cell odor responses and have been demonstrated to play an important role in olfactory tasks such as odor discrimination and odor detection <ref
