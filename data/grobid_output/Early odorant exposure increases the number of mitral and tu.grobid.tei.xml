min starting from time mouse began exploring the arena.</s><s>Food preference was assessed by comparing time spent sniffing a scented food pellet versus a control food pellet.</s><s>Mice were excluded from analysis if they climbed on top of and became entangled with the wire mesh containers (n ϭ 3).</s></p><p><s>M/TC identification.</s><s>After electroporation, the number of M72 M/TCs was determined through the z-stack of each OB section, avoiding double counting of cell bodies that span physical sections (data are presented as mean Ϯ SD, p-values were determined by unpaired t test).</s><s>Labeled cells with cell somata larger than Ͼ10 m and located Ͼ50% within the MCL were counted as MCs; labeled cells with cell somata larger than Ͼ10 m and located within the EPL were counted as TCs.</s><s>External TCs were not analyzed.</s><s>The locations of M/TCs were mapped on a coordinate system determined by anatomical landmarks (the M72 glomerulus center and the MCL below the glomerulus) to create a glomerulus-centric 3D map of M/TC spatial distribution that could be compared across animals.</s><s>For each cell, we measured: A, the absolute distance from the center of the soma to the glomerulus center, and B, the angle between the perpendicular line from the MCL to the glomerulus center and the line formed by the glomerulus center and the soma center.</s><s>x and y Cartesian coordinates were obtained by the following equations: x ϭ ϪA ‫ء‬ sin(B) and y ϭ A ‫ء‬ cos(B).</s><s>The z cartesian coordinate was the distance of the cell from the optical section that

measured by tracing the outline of the GFP-expressing axons in the glomerular layer within each optical Z-stack section.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Early odorant exposure changes the structure of a glomerular module profoundly Here, we demonstrate that odorant exposure during the prenatal and early postnatal period has profound effects on the composition of the glomerular module.</s><s>Namely, odorant exposure with methyl salicylate, an M72 ligand, increases the number of MCs and TCs connected to the M72 glomerulus by 40% and 100%, respectively.</s></p><p><s>The timing of our odorant exposure paradigm suggests that relevant early olfactory experience may specifically affect the process by which M/TC apical dendrites are pruned.</s><s>Immature MCs extend multiple apical dendrites and innervate multiple nearby glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pomeroy et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Matsutani and Yamamoto, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>By P10, the majority of M/TCs complete dendritic pruning such that each M/TC projects a single apical dendrite to a single glomerulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Malun and Brunjes, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Matsutani and Yamamoto, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>There is some evidence that this maturation process is odor dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Maher et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Our odorant exposure paradigm begins before birth and continues through early postnatal development, encompassing this refinement period, and our data show that odorant exposure induces the addition of nearby M/TCs to the M72 glomerular module (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, specific odorant experience may stabilize the M72glomerulus-projecting apical dendrite of M/TCs, whereas the apical dendrites projecting to other neighboring glomeruli are eliminated.</s><s>This would have the secondary effect of decreasing the number of M/TCs connected to neighboring glomeruli, although this likely represents a reduction of less than one cell per nearby glomerulus.</s></p><p><s>The dense local labeling of dendrites and axons in the glomerulus generated by in vivo electroporation precludes a robust analysis of the structural changes within the glomerulus itself.</s><s>The larger glomeruli produced after odorant exposure may be the product of increased OSN number or increased OSN axon branching and odorant exposure could also increase the volume of intraglomerular processes from JGCs or M/TCs.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we examined specifically the M72 glomerulus, a dorsally located glomerulus with a number of known odorant ligands.</s><s>These qualities allowed us to perform in vivo electroporation and odorant exposure with an M72 ligand.</s><s>However, we believe that these results will likely generalize to other glomeruli.</s><s>The M72 glomerulus has been well characterized and these analyses have been broadly applied to other glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Potter et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Treloar et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Feinstein and Mombaerts, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cavallin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Richard et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Valle-Leija et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zapiec and Mombaerts, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, the relatively late development of the M72 glomerulus compared with other, more rostral glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bailey et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Potter et al., 2001)</ref> may mean that the effects that we observe may be more or less prominent than in glomeruli that develop earlier.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anatomical changes to the M72 glomerular module are ligand specific</head><p><s>Prenatal and postnatal odorant exposure to hexanal-scented food did not increase M72 glomerular volume significantly.</s><s>Because hexanal is not a high-affinity ligand for the M72 odorant receptor, these data indicate that the structural changes induced by odorant exposure are not a result of global changes across the OB, but rather are specific to activated glomeruli.</s><s>Both hexanal-and methyl-salicylate-exposed mice showed a preference for food odorized with the exposure odorant, suggesting that the lack of change in M72 glomerular volume of hexanal-exposed animals was not due to ineffective odorant exposure.</s><s>Therefore, we conclude that the observed changes in glomerulus volume are activation specific.</s><s>Further analysis of the M/TC network of the M72 glomerulus is necessary to investigate whether plasticity of the M/TC network is also activation specific.</s></p></div>
