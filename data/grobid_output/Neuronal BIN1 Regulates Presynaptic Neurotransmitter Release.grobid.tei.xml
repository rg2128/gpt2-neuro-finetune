<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified BIN1 as a major susceptibility locus for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD).</s><s>BIN1, also known as Amphiphysin 2 (Amph2), is an adaptor protein that, among other roles, regulates membrane dynamics in the context of endocytosis and membrane remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Prokic et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Two alternative mechanisms have been proposed to link BIN1 with AD Tau pathology from work in cultured neurons: first, BIN1 can bind to Tau in the cytosol, and second, the function of BIN1 in endocytosis limits extracellular Tau uptake and pathology propagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Calafate et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chapuis et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Microglial BIN1 also has been recently found to influence the release of Tau in extracellular vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Crotti et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>The loss of BIN1 expression influences AD b-amyloid pathogenesis in cultured neurons, but this does not appear to be the case in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andrew et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Miyagawa et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Among older individuals without dementia, carriers of the BIN1 rs744373 risk allele were found to have similar amyloid pathology but increased Tau pathology and significantly impaired memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Franzmeier et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>The Bin1 gene undergoes complex alternative splicing to generate &gt;10 tissue-specific and ubiquitous isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De Rossi et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Prokic et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Independent studies have reported a decrease in the longest BIN1 isoform 1, which contains a central clathrin-associated protein-binding region (CLAP domain), in the brains of individuals with LOAD (De <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Rossi et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Holler et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McKenzie et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Despite the burgeoning interest in deciphering the involvement of BIN1 in AD pathophysiology, fundamental information on its physiological function in the brain, especially in neurons and synapses, is still lacking.</s></p><p><s>BIN1 and its mammalian paralog, Amph1, are members of the BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/ Rversus) domain protein superfamily.</s><s>Amph1 was discovered as a synaptic vesicleassociated protein enriched in nerve terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lichte et al., 1992)</ref> and suggested to play a role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis based on interactions with the AP-2 adaptor protein, dynamin 1, and synaptojanin <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Micheva et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Amph1 knockout (KO) mice have reduced viability and cognitive impairments.</s><s>Neurons cultured from Amph1 KO mice revealed defects in synaptic vesicle recycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Di Paolo et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, stiff person syndrome-associated autoantibodies against Amph1 compromised endocytosis preferentially at inhibitory GABAergic synapses by altering synaptic vesicle dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Geis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Werner et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The high sequence similarity between Amph1 and BIN1 and the ability of BIN1 to interact with Amph1, dynamin1, AP-2, clathrin, synaptojanin, and endophilin suggested a role for BIN1 at the presynapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Prokic et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>A recent study reported altered AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in cultured cortical neurons following acute knockdown of BIN1 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schürmann et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Aside from this single report of an in vitro study, the BIN1 function in synaptic transmission has not been characterized.</s><s>Here, we investigated the role of BIN1 at the synapse and in learning and memory using neuronal conditional KO (cKO) mice.</s><s>We report the impairment of spatial memory in association with the loss of BIN1 expression in the hippocampus.</s><s>Functional analysis of synaptic transmission in the CA1 of the hippocampus demonstrated impairment in neurotransmitter vesicle release at excitatory synapses of the cKO mice.</s><s>Super-resolution direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) localized BIN1 to presynaptic sites in glutamatergic synapses.</s><s>Confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy analysis of presynaptic morphology in cKO mice revealed a decrease in the density of presynaptic sites and the size of presynaptic protein clusters.</s><s>Finally, analysis of 3D EM image stacks from hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses revealed a significant increase in docked and reserve pools of synaptic vesicles in cKO mice.</s><s>These results demonstrate the presynaptic localization and functional role for BIN1 that are highly relevant to AD pathophysiology.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impaired Recognition Memory and Spatial Learning in Mice Lacking Neuronal BIN1 Expression</head><p><s>We used multiple behavior tests to assess memory acuity, in which the hippocampus plays a major role.</s><s>In the Y-maze test, a working memory task that engages neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain, and septum <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lalonde, 2002)</ref>, the loss of neuronal BIN1 expression did not affect total arm entries or spontaneous alternations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>In the novel object recognition test (NOR), a task that examines the communication between the hippocampus and the cortex in recognition memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Winters et al., 2008)</ref>, no difference was observed during the learning phase.</s><s>Quantification of the interaction index during the memory recollection phase revealed a significantly impaired NOR performance in the Emx model but not in the Syn model (Ctl versus Syn p = 0.6411; Ctl versus Emx p = 0.0014).</s><s>(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that the loss of Bin1 in excitatory neurons in the forebrain led to an impairment in a task that assesses recognition memory performance.</s></p><p><s>We then tested whether BIN1 is required for behavioral tasks that engage the amygdala and hippocampal circuits using a fear-conditioning paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kim and Jung, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>No difference in the cumulative freezing time was observed in Bin1 cKO mice as compared to littermate Ctl (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>These results suggested that mice are able to associate a specific environment with the aversive stimulus in the absence of BIN1 expression.</s><s>Moreover, both Ctl and Syn mice showed the same fear extinction pattern when mice were returned once per week in the contextual chamber without shock (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>), confirming normal amygdaladependent learning.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we tested spatial learning memory using the Morris water maze and observed a clear difference between Ctl mice and both neuronal Bin1 cKO models.</s><s>Over the 7-day training period, Ctl mice significantly reduced the time to find the platform (&gt;80% success of finding the platform in 3 consecutive days), indicative of a successful learning process.</s><s>However, the two cKO models failed to show a definite improvement in the latency to find the platform during the acquisition phase (the latency in seconds to find platform day 1 versus day 7: Ctl 74.57</s><s>± 3.9 versus 45. <ref type="bibr">86 ± 4.65,</ref><ref type="bibr">p &lt;
