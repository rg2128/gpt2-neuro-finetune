type="bibr" target="#b7">(Duchamp-Viret et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>However, this cannot account entirely for the latency changes of the M/T cell spikes we observe because evoked EPSPs in some M/T cells did not necessarily show a significant decrease in latency in response to increasing odor intensity.</s><s>Even for M/T cells in which EPSP latencies decreased in response to stronger odors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), the latency shifts of the early APs were greater than those of the EPSPs.</s><s>Rather, we believe that changes in the amplitude and slope of the

population of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Laurent, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>In this case, the average response of an ensemble of responding M/T cells can also convey temporal information.</s><s>In support of this view, we find that changes in odor intensity are also reflected in the timing of respiration-coupled IPSPs, which are attributable to lateral inhibition initiated by spikes from other M/T cells that were excited by the odor.</s><s>Although we cannot determine the role of spike timing in the coding of odor intensity in higher olfactory centers, we think it is likely that the

and the overall latency relative to the respiration cycle and the neuronal activity coupled to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Spors and Grinvald, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>These recent studies reinforce the notion that odor identity and intensity can be encoded by population responses of M/T cells.</s><s>Our results of intensity-dependent changes in spike timing are likely to contribute to odor coding in the context of the spatial representation of odors in the bulb as well.</s><s>For example, AP propagation in M/T cell lateral dendrites can be gated by lateral inhibition <ref type="bibr"
