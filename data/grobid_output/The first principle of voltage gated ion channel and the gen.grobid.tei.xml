<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Text:</head><p><s>Neural circuit model is a popular approach and a useful mathematical model to investigate the electrical current and neural signal propagation on neurites at different sites and times <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>A most critical issue for this approach is the configuration of the circuit.</s><s>Starting from the cable model, which is directly derived from the biological structure of the axon, and developed by the famous Hodgkin-Huxley model (H-H model) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, the RC (resistor-capacitor) configuration has been a basic circuitry unit for whole computational neuroscience.</s><s>The existence of the inductance has never drawn the attention of the mainstream academia.</s><s>However, even in the early stage of neuroscience, the direct impedance measurement of giant squid axon already confirms the inductive reactance in axons <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>This huge inductance can be repeatedly measured in all kinds of neuron related research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref

target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, some abnormal experimental observations, such as the frequency dependent response of nerve fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and the anode break excitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>, cannot be well explained without including the inductor in the neural circuit.</s><s>To solve these issues, some theories and ideas are proposed, such as frequency-dependent membrane capacitance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> (for the frequency dependent response) and the virtual-cathode hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> (for the anode break excitation).</s><s>To develop a comprehensive model, an inductor was added in the neural circuit.</s><s>With the inductor, the neural circuit should follow an RLC configuration rather than an RC configuration.</s><s>Then the frequency dependent response becomes the intrinsic feature of the neural system.</s><s>The anode break excitation is also comprehensible: the biphasic voltage oscillation of the RLC circuit after the termination of a hyperpolarizing current, which will be detailed demonstrated in this study, surely has a chance to fire the action potential.</s><s>Is there an inductance factor in the neural systems?</s><s>The answer is "Yes".</s><s>Previously people tend to believe this inductance does not really exist simply because they cannot find a physical entity to account for such a huge inductive reactance.</s><s>In this study, together with the direct experimental evidence of the existence of the inductance in neural systems, a comprehensive theoretical explanation of the physical entities to generate this inductance will be provided.</s><s>To proof the correctness of this theory, we will show how those most important experimental observations and phenomena are derived from this theory.</s></p><p><s>In the experiment part, we analyzed the signal in EMG recording of electrical nerve stimulations.</s><s>The curve fitting of the stimulus artifact shows that the neural circuit should generally follow a parallel RLC configuration.</s><s>The resonance frequency of this RLC circuit can be measured in both stimulus artifacts and EMG signals.</s><s>Then based on this RLC circuit, the well-known strengthduration relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>, can be directly derived from this parallel RLC circuit.</s><s>Moreover, this strength-duration relationship is amended to a more precise format and its prediction has already been validated by experimental observations from other groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the theory part, a comprehensive theoretical explanation of the physical entities to generate the inductance is provided.</s><s>Simply speaking, this inductance is generated by the coil structure of the myelin sheaths and the piezoelectric effect of the plasma membrane.</s><s>Based on this theory, we can get many unique predictions, which are all validated by previous researches and observations.</s><s>Here we only give the two most critical predictions:</s></p><p><s>1. Adjacent myelin sheaths always follow the opposite wrapping orientations, which has been well validated by the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>This phenomenon cannot be explained by any previous theories and models, but now can be obtained from this theory.</s><s>2. There will be a mechanical wave accompany with the electrical neural signal.</s><s>This mechanical wave has been studied for more than 10 years and an alternative theory called soliton theory has been developed to explain this mechanical wave <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>In soliton theory, with a complicated calculation, it is claimed that the propagation speed of the mechanical wave is the same as that of the electrical signal predicted by the H-H model.</s><s>However, in our theory, we can get this result without any calculation.</s><s>This mechanical wave is an attendant phenomenon with the electric neural signal.</s><s>It surely has the same speed as the electric signal.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Analysis of the stimulus artifacts</head><p><s>The typical samples of the EMG recording in the electrical stimulation of the cortical and pelvic nerves are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a) and (c), respectively.</s><s>The experimental details can be found in Supplementary S1 and S2.</s><s>As seen, there will be two separate signals: the stimulus artifact and the EMG signal induced by the electrical stimulation.</s><s>For most of the cases in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>, people only focused on the analysis of the EMG signals since they are the real neural responses.</s><s>However, the stimulus artifacts are the direct electrical responses of the whole tissue and organism affected by the injected current, revealing its electrical characteristics.</s><s>In other words, the configuration of the equivalent neural circuit can be obtained from these electrical responses.</s></p><p><s>A detailed analysis of the stimulus artifacts are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(b) and (d), respectively.</s><s>A monophasic square wave current pulse (blue curve) of a certain single phase pulse width (SPPW) was applied.</s><s>As seen, the stimulus artifacts (red curve) and the current pulse share the same rising edge and falling edge.</s><s>But there are two interesting points to be observed:</s></p><p><s>1. Within the current pulse, the stimulus artifact has a certain voltage oscillation.</s><s>2. After the current pulse, there is another voltage oscillation with an opposite polarity.</s></p><p><s>Previously, it was widely believed that there is no inductance in the neural circuit.</s><s>The whole neural circuit should follow a general RC configuration.</s><s>However, the electrical response of the RC circuit to a square wave current pulse will not show a voltage oscillation.</s><s>This voltage oscillation is the feature of an RLC circuit.</s><s>Therefore, we tried fitting the stimulus artifact with an RLC circuit.</s><s>Here we used a parallel RLC circuit (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(e)) for modeling to fit the stimulus artifacts, shown as green curves in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(b) and (d), respectively.</s><s>The voltage oscillations within and after the current pulses can be duplicated and the whole waveform can be generally fitted.</s><s>The detailed modeling parameters in Figure1(b) and (d) of all electrical units can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>(</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2-(b)&amp;(d)).</head><p><s>From the waveform fitting in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(b) and (d), it is quite possible that the general equivalent neural circuit should follow a parallel RLC configuration.</s><s>We can validate this from two aspects:</s></p><p><s>1.</s><s>By changing the SPPW and the waveforms of the current pulses, the waveforms of the stimulus artifacts will change with a certain pattern, which can also be fitted by the electrical voltage response of the equivalent parallel RLC circuit.</s><s>In other words, the stimulus artifacts generated by any kinds of current waveforms with any pulse widths shall be fitted.</s><s>2. The voltage response of the parallel RLC circuit is frequency dependent.</s><s>In some cases, when the quality factor, which is the Q factor, is high enough, there will be a resonance effect, resulting in a maximum amplitude of the recording data.</s><s>So in both the stimulus artifact the EMG recording, there should be a measurable resonance frequency of the neural system.</s></p><p><s>The results of the validation of the two points mentioned above are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Three kinds of commonly used square current waveforms are used in tests: positive monophasic, negative monophasic and positive-first biphasic waveform (indicated at the left upper corner of all (i) figures).</s><s>The SPPW is changed within a certain range to clearly show the changing pattern of the stimulus artifacts (all (i) figures).</s><s>Then the modeling results are shown in all (ii) figures.</s><s>All the modeling parameters can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>(2-(a) to (f)).</s></p><p><s>Firstly, it can be clearly observed that the general changing pattern of the stimulus artifacts can be well fitted by the modeling results.</s><s>Even the changing pattern of different waveforms are completely different, the changing pattern can always be duplicated by tuning the circuit parameters.</s><s>Secondly, in Figure <ref type="figure">2(c),</ref><ref type="figure">(d</ref>) and (f), a distinct resonance effect can be found, indicated by the solid purple arrow in experimental data and dash purple arrow in modelling results.</s><s>In cortical stimulation, the resonance effect happens between SPPW of 300 µs and 350 µs, referring to a resonance frequency between 1429 Hz and 1667 Hz.</s><s>In pelvic nerve stimulation, the resonance effect happens between SPPW of 60 µs and 100 µs, referring to a resonance frequency between 5000 Hz and 8333 Hz.</s></p><p><s>An interesting phenomenon to be observed in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> is that, together with the RLC circuit response, some data shows an RC discharging pattern, indicated with the black arrows in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a-i), (b-i), (c-i) and (f-i).</s><s>This RC discharging effect can be recognized by comparing the experimental data with the modelling results.</s><s>The voltage curve gradually drops at the position, whereas the voltage is predicted to keep constant in the modelling.</s><s>This indicates that an additional capacitor should be added in the circuit to improve the modeming precision.</s><s>The corresponding circuit with this additional capacitor and be found in the supplementary S3.</s><s>And more repeated testing data showing the similar result can be found in the supplementary S4, validating the stability of the RLC neural circuit for analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Analysis of the EMG signals</head><p><s>The above-mentioned data confirms the existence of the inductance in the neural system.</s><s>Then this inductance will also induce a resonance effect on the neural responses, which shall be observed in EMG signals.</s><s>However, not all kinds of waveforms are effective to induce the nerve stimulation, only the data with successful stimulation is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The cortical stimulation results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</s><s>The negative monophasic square current pulses of 300 µA and 500 µA with SPPW from 100 µs to 900 µs were applied.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a-i</ref>) and (b-i) shows the complete data.</s><s>The detailed artifacts are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a-ii) and (b-ii), respectively.</s><s>As seen, these stimulus artifacts share the same pattern as observed in Figure <ref type="figure">2(b-i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The detailed EMG signals are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a-iii) and (b-iii).</s><s>The inset figures show the amplitude of the EMG signal with different SPPWs.</s><s>The resonance effect is quite distinct.</s><s>The amplitude peaks at SPPW= 500 µs for both results of 300 µA and 500 µA, indicating that the resonance frequency of cortical is 1000 Hz.</s></p><p><s>The pelvic nerve stimulation results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Three kinds of waveforms were applied with a constant current amplitude, 70 µA.</s><s>The complete data is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4(a)</ref>.</s><s>The detailed stimulus artifacts can be found in Figure <ref type="figure">2(d-f</ref>).</s><s>The EMG amplitudes with SPPW for three waveforms in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>(b) shows a clear resonance effect happened at SPPW=150 µs, which agrees with the resonance frequency of the stimulus artifact.</s><s>The resonance effect is the strongest for the negative monophasic waveform: the amplitude of the EMG signal significantly drops when the SPPW is higher than 150 µs.</s></p><p><s>Up to here, we have shown clear data to prove the existence of the inductance in neural tissue.</s><s>People may 1.</s><s>Why the resonance frequencies of the stimulus artifacts and EMG signal are not matched with each other.</s><s>In pelvic nerve stimulation, the resonance frequencies of stimulus artifacts and EMG signal are all within the range from 5000 Hz to 8333 Hz.</s><s>But in cortical stimulation, the resonance frequency of stimulus artifacts is between 1667 Hz and 1429 Hz (Figure <ref type="figure">2(a-c</ref>)), which is quite different from the resonance frequency in EMG signals, which is 1000 Hz. 2.
