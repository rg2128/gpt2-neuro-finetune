(2020)</ref> found that repeated coactivation of a7 nAChR on OLMa2 interneurons and a local SC pathway increased CA1 EPSCs and reduced IPSCs.</s><s>However, the mechanisms through which the activation of the OLMa2 interneurons regulates the activity of inhibitory interneurons targeting the CA1 pyramidal cell, and how this facilitates the increase of SC-evoked EPSPs of the CA1 pyramidal cells remain elusive.</s></p><p><s>In the CA1 region, a7 nAChR can be found on both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites of GABAergic synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fabian-Fine, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>For this reason, the outcome of a7 nAChR activation and how it modulates OLMa2 interneuron activity is difficult to address.</s><s>Activation of postsynaptic a7 nAChRs could increase the spiking frequency of OLMa2 interneurons, although, to our knowledge, OLMa2 spiking by nAChRs has not been clearly characterized, while presynaptic a7 nAChRs regulate the release of neurotransmitter by activating calcium-dependent pathways that lead to the fusion of neurotransmitter vesicles with the membrane of the neuron <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desikan et al., 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this work, we use a minimal biophysical circuit model, driven quantitatively by in vitro data, to show how modulation of OLM cells (O-cells) influences the activity of fast-spiking interneurons whose GABAergic inputs are colocalized with the SC glutamatergic synapses onto a CA1 pyramidal cell dendrite, and how this promotes the induction of plasticity at the SC-CA1 synapse.</s><s>We seek to determine how cholinergic activation of the OLM cells through presynaptic a7 nAChRs can downregulate the GABAergic signaling onto the pyramidal cells, and how recurrent decreased inhibitory inputs can indirectly enhance the plasticity of the excitatory SC-CA1 synapse.</s><s>We thus constructed a minimal circuit consisting of a single compartment spiking model of an OLM interneuron (O-cell) with a7 nAChRs, a fast-spiking interneuron (I-cell) with AMPA and GABA A receptors, and a pyramidal cell dendritic compartment (E D ) with AMPA, NMDA, and GABA A receptors.</s><s>They are connected as schematically shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Overwhelming evidence suggests that most types of LTP involve calcium influx through NMDARs and subsequent changes in the properties of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), namely changes in their number and phosphorylation state <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Collingridge et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barria et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lüscher and Malenka, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>To reflect these mechanisms, we use the calcium-based synaptic plasticity model (proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Shouval et al., 2002)</ref> to model synaptic plasticity of the SC-CA1 excitatory synapse.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we use a combination of experiments with computational modeling to put together a coherent picture of the multiple mechanisms through which concurrent disinhibition directly induces local SC-CA1 plasticity.</s><s>More specifically, we show how repeated concurrent disinhibition induces LTP by mediating AMPAR trafficking.</s><s>Our modeling results also put together all the pieces of the puzzle to lay out how nAChR cholinergic action on OLM interneurons, working through calcium-dependent regulation of GABA neurotransmission, can downregulate the GABAergic signaling onto CA1 pyramidal cells and induce potentiation of the SC-CA1 synapse.</s></p></div>
