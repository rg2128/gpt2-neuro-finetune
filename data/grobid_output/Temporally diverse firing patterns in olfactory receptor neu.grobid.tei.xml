repertoire of 1000 ORNs consisting of 100 different types of ORNs (10 replicates of each type).</s><s>The response of each ORN in the model to a given odorant was characterized by the following parameters: response amplitude (from prestimulus baseline to peak), latency, rise and fall time constants, adaptation rate, and baseline response (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Parameter values were chosen to match those we observed in our recordings from ORNs.</s></p><p><s>When stimulated with an odorant, the ORN response, after the initial latency period (randomly generated for each type from a uniform distribution [0, 200 ms]), increased from its baseline firing rate with a rise time constant ( rise ) obtained from a uniform distribution [0, 600 ms].</s><s>The ORN response amplitude to a given odor was determined as follows:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R i A ϭ ͩ ͯOdor A 3 ͯ ⅐ cos ͩ ORNi 3 , Odor A 3 ͪ p ͪ

of the odor vector that represents concentration, is the angle between the ORN selectivity vector and the odor vector, p defines the receptive field width of the neuron (uniformly randomly distributed between <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">15]</ref>; small values of p create broadly tuned ORNs, whereas larger values generate sharply tuned receptor neurons), and is a sigmoid function ((x) ϭ (1 ϩ exp(Ϫa 1 (x Ϫ a 2 ))) Ϫ1 [a 1 ϭ 15, a 2 ϭ 0.8]).</s><s>When was sufficiently large ( Ն 82°), the maximum response amplitude was set to zero to model the inhibitory ORN responses we (and others; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hallem and Carlson, 2006)</ref> observed in vivo.</s></p><p><s>To simulate results from our recordings of ORNs (and published results; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hallem and Carlson, 2006)</ref>, we modeled two categories of ORN responses with equal probability: those that phasically terminate quickly after a strong initial response and those with more persistent, tonic responses.</s><s>For ORNs with brief firings, responses were set to follow an ␣ function (t ϫ exp(Ϫ2t/ rise )).</s><s>For ORNs whose responses persisted throughout the duration of the odor pulse, the initial response from baseline to peak amplitude followed t ϫ exp(Ϫt/ rise ) (until t ϭ rise ).</s><s>Subsequently, the responses decreased linearly over time depending on adaptation rates obtained from a uniform random distribution between [0.1, 1].</s><s>Finally, after the odorant was removed, the ORN responses returned back to baseline following exp(Ϫt/ fall ), where the fall time constant ( fall ) for each ORN type was randomly picked from a uniform distribution over the interval [0, 1200 ms].</s></p><p><s>To realize an ORN repertoire with heterogeneous odor selectivity, we simulated multiple ORN types by using different randomly generated affinity vectors, and by selecting a different set of values from the defined uniform distributions for the other parameters.</s><s>We generated homogeneous ORN populations (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A2</ref>) by uniformly applying the median rise time constant and adaptation values and by setting the response latency and fall time constants to fixed values (0 and 200 ms, respectively), and we set all receptor neurons to the persistent firing category.</s><s>To create an ORN repertoire that had homogeneous amplitude (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A3</ref>), we set the peak firing rate to 0.75 for all ORNs.</s></p><p><s>AL model.</s><s>The AL model consisted of 100 PNs and 30 local neurons (LNs).</s><s>Each cell was modeled as a fast-spiking neuron using a computationally efficient map-based model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rulkov et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Our choice of neuronal model was not critical; we obtained comparable results using a different reduced Hodgkin-Huxley model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Izhikevich, 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Each PN

type="bibr" target="#b20">(Laurent, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Farivar, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Our simulations, though, showed that the model's properties were robust within a broad range of convergence values; odor separability in PN ensembles was consistent when up to 5% of ORN types converged on a glomerulus, but, as expected, separability success dropped gradually and monotonically as input from more types of ORNs were combined (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s></p><p><s>Each LN received

analysis.</s><s>To analyze the PN response motifs induced by electrical or odor stimulation, we first binned the PN spikes into nonoverlapping 200 ms windows.</s><s>To be considered stimulus evoked, responses had to meet two criteria applied to each time bin <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Perez-Orive et al., 2002)</ref>: (1) amplitude: the firing rate in each trial had to exceed 3 SDs of mean baseline activity;</s></p><p><s>(2) reliability: the amplitude criterion had to be met in at least 5 of 10 trials.</s><s>The number of response transitions (excitatory to no response, excitatory to inhibitory, inhibitory to no response, inhibitory to excitatory, no response to inhibitory, no response to excitatory) was counted in time bins starting from odor onset to 3 s after odor offset (20 time bins).</s></p><p><s>Trajectory analysis.</s><s>To generate odor-evoked response trajectories, we followed a procedure outlined previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Stopfer et al.,

odors based on responses of ORNs.</s><s>ORN spike counts were binned into consecutive 200 ms segments so that responses in each trial (3 s starting at odor onset) were represented by a 15-dimensional unit vector (Frobenius norm).</s><s>Classification of a trial was correct if the Euclidean distance from that trial's response was less than the distance to means of responses elicited by other odors.</s><s>For an analysis of instantaneous ensemble coding, spikes elicited by five odors in three ORNs were segmented into 50, 100, and 200 ms bins.</s><s>The mean three-dimensional vector (one dimension from each ORN) of the five trials for each odor was used as the centroid for classification for the corresponding odor.</s></p><p><s>Correlation analysis.</s><s>Twelve odorants belonging to four different chemical classes were modeled in this study.</s><s>Odorants that belonged to the same class had odor property vectors that were set to be more similar to each other than those belonging to different classes.</s></p><p><s>For the correlation analysis, ORN responses and PN spike counts were binned into consecutive 50 ms segments.</s><s>Pairwise correlation coefficients between activity patterns were computed at different response times to quantify differences in responses to different odor pairs over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Friedrich and Laurent,

with those obtained at later response times was computed as second-order correlations.</s><s>The analysis was repeated after removing either GABA A -or GABA B -type inhibitory currents or both GABA A -and GABA B -type inhibitory interactions.</s></p><p><s>Comparison of odor representation in ORN and PN coding space.</s><s>Fifty odorants were used to compare the odor representations in populations of ORNs and PNs.</s><s>ORN responses and PN spike counts were binned into consecutive 50 ms segments.</s><s>The high-dimensional response vectors in each time bin starting from 1 s before stimulus delivery to 3 s after odor onset (80 samples per odor, 50 odors, giving 4000 samples) were individually projected onto the first two principal directions that accounted for maximum variance in the data.</s><s>To allow comparison of the intrinsic dimensionality of the ORN and AL coding space, eigenvalues of the ORN and PN response covariance matrices were divided by their sum and plotted in descending order.</s></p><p><s>LFP and sliding-window cross-correlograms.</s><s>The LFP in the model was computed as the sum of action potentials in PNs (filtered between 5 and 55
