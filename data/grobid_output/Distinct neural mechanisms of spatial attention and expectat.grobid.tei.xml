allocate attentional resources to locations where events are likely to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Summerfield and Egner, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, the majority of previous paradigms, most prominently the classical Posner paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Posner, 1980)</ref>, manipulated observer's endogenous spatial attention via probabilistic cues that indicate where a task-relevant target is likely to occur.</s><s>Only recently has unisensory research attempted to dissociate attention and expectation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Shulman et al., 2009;</ref><ref

senses.</s><s>This raises the critical question of how the brain allocates spatial attention and forms spatial expectations in a multisensory environment.</s><s>Because observers need to respond to stimuli regardless of the sense by which they are perceived, they may allocate attentional resources interactively across the senses and form an "amodal map" that encodes the probability of events.</s><s>In line with this conjecture, parietal cortices have previously been shown to integrate audiovisual signals weighted by their bottom-up sensory reliabilities and top-down task-relevance into audiovisual spatial priority maps <ref type="bibr">(Rohe and</ref><ref type="bibr">Noppeney, 2015, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, attentional resources were shown to be allocated interactively

how the brain forms spatial expectations across sensory modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Stekelenburg and Vroomen, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Because information is initially gathered by distinct sensory organs and enters the brain via parallel pathways, each sensory system may initially encode the probability of signals selectively for its preferred sensory modality.</s><s>These modality-specific spatial expectations may be reinforced particularly in environments where auditory and visual signals arise from separate sources such as in experiments that present auditory or visual signals independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Spence and Driver, 1996)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The current study investigated how the brain allocates spatial attention and forms spatial

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion criteria</head><p><s>A subgroup of 22 participants who had taken part in the psychophysics experiment was selected to take part in the fMRI experiment.</s><s>Inclusion criteria were participants' accuracy and fixation performance in the psychophysics experiment.</s><s>Only participants who in the psychophysics experiment produced Ͻ20 saccades averaged across blocks and showed overall accuracy Ͼ95% (calculated as the percentage of hits ϩ correct rejections, pooling over auditory and visual stimuli) were selected for the fMRI experiment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p><s>Auditory spatialized stimuli (100 ms duration) were created by convolving a burst of white noise (with 5 ms onset and offset ramps) with spatially specific head-related transfer functions based on the KEMAR dummy head of the MIT Media Lab (http://sound.media.mit.edu/</s><s>resources/KEMAR.html;</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gardner and Martin, 1995)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Visual stimuli (i.e., the so-called "flashes") were white disks (100 ms duration; radius: 0.88°visual angle, luminance: 165 cd/m 2 ) presented on a gray background (luminance: 78 cd/m 2 ).</s><s>Both auditory and visual stimuli were presented at Ϯ10°visual angle along the azimuth (0°visual angle for elevation).</s><s>A fixation cross was presented in the center of the screen throughout the entire experiment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p><s>In both the psychophysics and the fMRI experiment, we orthogonally manipulated spatial attention (i.e., task-relevance or response requirement) and expectation (i.e., stimulus probability) across the two hemifields selectively in audition and evaluated their effects on observers' neural and behavioral responses to auditory and visual signals.</s><s>Thus, the 2 ϫ 2 ϫ 2 ϫ 2 design manipulated auditory spatial attention (left vs right hemifield), auditory spatial expectation (left vs right hemifield), stimulus location (left vs right hemifield) and stimulus modality (auditory vs visual; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>For the behavioral and fMRI data analysis we pooled over stimulus locations (left/right) leading to a 2 (attended vs unattended) ϫ 2 (expected vs unexpected) ϫ 2 (auditory vs visual stimulus modality) factorial design.</s><s>Across days, auditory spatial expectation was manipulated as spatial signal probability, i.e., the probability for auditory stimuli to be presented in the left or right hemifield.</s><s>Both the psychophysics and fMRI experiments were preceded by training runs, in which the spatial probability ratio of auditory targets was set to 9:1 for the expected/unexpected hemifields to boost the implicit learning of auditory spatial signal probability.</s><s>In the psychophysics and fMRI experiments the auditory stimuli were presented with a ratio of 4:1 in the expected/unexpected hemifields.</s><s>Observers were not explicitly informed about those probabilities.</s><s>Auditory spatial attention was manipulated as "task-relevance", i.e., the requirement to respond to an auditory target in the left versus right hemifield.</s><s>Critically, spatial attention and expectation were manipulated only in audition but not in vision.</s><s>Participants needed to respond to all visual targets that were presented in either spatial hemifield with equal probability (i.e., 1:1 in the expected/unexpected hemifields; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Throughout the entire experiment a central fixation cross coded in color whether participants should attend and respond to sounds in either their left or right hemifield.</s><s>The mapping between color and task-relevant hemifield was counterbalanced across participants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial signal, general response, and spatially selective response probability</head><p><s>Our experiment orthogonally manipulated spatial attention as taskrelevance and expectation as spatial signal probability selectively in audition.</s><s>The attentional manipulation is therefore operationally linked with response requirement over space.</s><s>Further, attention as response requirement and expectation as signal probability are intimately linked by codetermining general (i.e., the probability that the observer needs to make a response regardless of the hemifield in which the signal is presented) and spatially selective (i.e., the probability that the observer needs to make a response conditioned on that the signal is presented in a particular hemifield) response probabilities.</s></p><p><s>As shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>, the general response probability is greater in block type 1, where attention and expectation are directed to the same hemifields, than in block type 2, where attention and expectation are directed to different hemifields.</s><s>Put differently, greater demands are placed on response inhibition in block type 2 where the hemifield with the more frequent auditory stimuli is task-irrelevant (i.e., a response needs to be inhibited).</s></p><p><s>Likewise, the spatially selective response probability is codetermined by both attention and expectation.</s><s>Observers need to respond to both auditory and visual stimuli in the attended hemifield, so that the response probability in the attended hemifield is always equal to one.</s><s>By contrast, in the unattended hemifield observers need to respond only to the visual stimuli.</s><s>Hence, in the unattended hemifield the response probability also depends on the frequency of the auditory stimuli and hence on expectation.</s><s>In the unattended hemifield the response probability is thus smaller and hence response inhibition greater when the task-irrelevant auditory stimuli are more frequent.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, in our paradigm general and spatially selective response probabilities would predict an interaction between attention and expectation that is common to auditory and visual stimuli.</s><s>Conversely, main effects of attention and expectation cannot be explained by differences in response probability.</s><s>For illustration purposes and analysis, we pooled over stimulus locations (left/right).</s><s>Presence versus absence of response requirement is indicated by the hand symbol.</s><s>B, Number of auditory (orange) and visual (blue) trials in the 2 (A attended vs unattended) ϫ 2 (A expected vs unexpected) design.</s><s>Presence versus absence of response requirement is indicated by the hand symbol.</s><s>The fraction of the area indicated by the "Response" hand symbol pooled over the two bars of one particular block type (e.g., block type 1) represents the "general response probability" (i.e., the overall probability that a response is required on a particular trial); the general response probability is greater for block type 1 (90%), where attention and expectation are congruent, than block type 2 (60%), where they are incongruent.</s><s>The fraction of the area indicated by the Response hand symbol for each bar represents the "spatially selective response probability", i.e., the probability that the observer needs to make a response conditioned on the signal being presented in a particular hemifield; the spatially selective response probability is greater when unattended signals are presented in the unexpected (71.4%) than expected (38.4%) hemifield.</s><s>C, fMRI runs included 10 blocks of 20 trials alternating with fixation periods.</s><s>A fixation cross was presented throughout the entire run.</s><s>The colors indicate as follows: white, fixation period; green or pink, activation period with auditory attention directed to the left (or right) hemifield.</s><s>On each trial participants were presented with an auditory or visual stimulus (100 ms duration) either in their left or right hemifield.</s><s>They were instructed to respond as fast and accurately as possible with their right index finger within a response window of 1400 ms.</s><s>D, Bar plots show response times (across subjects' mean Ϯ SEM) for each of the six conditions with response requirements in the fMRI experiment.</s><s>The brackets and stars indicate significance of main effects and interactions.</s><s>**p Ͻ 0.01, ***p Ͻ 0.001.</s><s>Audition, orange; vision, blue; attended, full pattern; unattended, striped pattern; expected, dark shade; unexpected, light shade.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedures</head><p><s>The current study included two experiments: (1) a psychophysics experiment conducted across 2 d (i.e., auditory spatial expectation was manipulated between the 2 d), and (2) an fMRI experiment conducted across other 2 d (i.e., auditory spatial expectation was manipulated between the 2 d).</s><s>The psychophysics experiment was conducted before the fMRI experiment.</s><s>On each day, the psychophysics and the fMRI experimental runs were preceded by two training runs (see Experimental design).</s></p><p><s>Each experimental run (duration: ϳ8 min/run) included 10 attention blocks with 20 trials each, interleaved with 6 s fixation baseline periods.</s><s>As a result of our balanced factorial design, blocks were of two types: in block type 1, spatial attention and expectation were congruent (i.e., spatial attention was directed to the hemifield with higher auditory target frequency); in block type 2, spatial attention and expectation were incongruent (i.e., attention was directed to the hemifield with lower auditory target frequency; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, both psychophysics and fMRI experiments included 2000 trials ϭ 20 trials ϫ 10 blocks (attention manipulation: 5 blocks of type 1 and 5 blocks of type 2) ϫ 5 experimental runs ϫ 2 d (expectation manipulation) in total.</s><s>Therefore, each block type included 400 auditory stimuli for the expected hemifield (pooled over left and right) and 100 auditory stimuli for the unexpected hemifield (pooled over left and right).</s><s>Each block type also included 250 visual stimuli for the expected hemifield and 250 visual stimuli for the unexpected hemifield (pooled over left and right).</s><s>For further details, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> shows the absolute number of trials for each condition and block type and their response requirement for the psychophysics and the fMRI experiment.</s></p><p><s>The order of "expectation" days (i.e., left vs right) and the color (i.e., pink or green) of the fixation cross (i.e., attention instruction) were counterbalanced across participants, the order of attention blocks was counterbalanced within and across participants and the order of stimulus location and stimulus modality were pseudorandomized within each participant.</s><s>Brief breaks were included after every run to provide feedback to participants about their performance accuracy (averaged across all conditions) in the target detection task.</s><s>In the psychophysics experiment participants' fixation performance was monitored via eye tracking, and participants were provided with feedback about their eye movements (i.e., fixation maintenance) during the breaks.</s><s>For the psychophysics experiment, mean group number of saccades was 22.9 Ϯ 5.2 (across subjects mean Ϯ SEM) and mean group accuracy was 97% Ϯ 0.2% (across subjects mean Ϯ SEM) for the psychophysics experiment and 97% Ϯ 0.5% (across subjects mean Ϯ SEM) for the fMRI experiment.</s></p><p><s>Each trial (SOA: 2200 ms) included three periods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C):</ref> (1) the fixation cross alone (700 ms duration), (2) the brief flash or sound (stimulus duration: 100 ms), and (3) the fixation cross alone, i.e., response window (1400 ms).</s><s>Participants responded to the auditory targets in the attended hemifield and to all visual targets via key press with their right index finger (i.e., the same response for all auditory and visual targets) as fast and accurately as possible.</s><s>They fixated the cross in the center of the screen which was presented throughout the entire experiment.</s></p><p><s>On each day, participants were first familiarized with the stimuli in brief practice runs (with equal spatial signal probability) to train them on target detection performance and, only in the psychophysics experiment, also on fixation (i.e., a warning signal was shown when the disparity between the central fixation cross and the eye-data samples exceeded 2.5°).</s></p><p><s>After the final fMRI day, participants indicated in a questionnaire whether they thought the sound or the flash was presented more frequently in one of the two spatial hemifields.</s><s>Eighteen of the total 22 participants correctly reported that the auditory stimuli were more frequent in one hemifield and 20 of 22 participants reported the visual stimuli to be equally frequent across the two hemifields, suggesting that most participants were aware of the manipulation of signal probability.</s></p></div>
