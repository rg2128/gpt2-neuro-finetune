however, the molecular mechanisms through which the IP 3 pathway is activated are not well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, and these are complicated by the heterogeneity of ORs.</s><s>This heterogeneity is partly a result of the existence of a large repertoire of mammalian ORs: More than 350 human and 1000 mouse ORs have been identified thus far.</s><s>Although much is now known about the ligand specificity of other GPCRs, the odor discrimination and specificity of most ORs remain poorly characterized, despite having been discovered in 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The evidence thus far suggests that odor recognition in mammals depends on complex receptor-ligand interactions that result in the activation of a repertoire of ORs that are found on defined subsets of OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>Efforts toward understanding OR-ligand interactions have been impeded by the poor activation of ORs in non-OSNs, such as transfected cell systems.</s><s>Several cofactors are now used, in combination, to improve the activation of ORs in transfected cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s>For example, we demonstrated that the cotransfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with plasmids encoding ORs and transmembrane, olfactory-specific receptor transporting proteins (RTPs) 1 and 2 substantially increases the abundance of ORs at the cell surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</s><s>ORs that are tagged at the N terminus with the first 20-amino acid residues of rhodopsin (Rho tag) are frequently used in transfected cell systems because the Rho-tag enhances the membrane targeting of some ORs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Hague et al.</ref> found that the cell surface abundance of one OR, OR-M71, is enhanced when other GPCRs, including the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) and the purinergic receptor P2Y1, are coexpressed in HEK 293 cells; however, this enhancement applies only to OR-M71 and a closely related receptor, but not to other ORs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>These findings have led to improvements in our ability to activate ORs in vitro, and they support the idea that ORs do not function alone, but require a number of accessory proteins.</s><s>Given that the sensitivities of ORs in transfected cells remain poor compared to those of ORs in OSNs and that a large percentage of ORs are orphan receptors, we considered the possibility that additional cofactors might be required for OR functions that require receptorreceptor interactions.</s></p><p><s>Although GPCR heteromerization is not well understood, such interactions are thought to be essential for the function of a number of GPCRs through various mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>For example, heterodimerization of the γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA B ) receptors GABA B R1 and GABA B R2 is required for the proper trafficking of GABA B receptors in neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>In other instances, however, the formation of heterodimers appears to regulate GPCR signaling.</s><s>For example, heterodimerization is required for the reciprocal modulation of β 2 ARs and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors in cardiomyocytes.</s><s>When the activity of β 2 AR is blocked with antagonists, the AT1 receptor is functionally decoupled from Gα q , independent of angiotensin binding.</s><s>Conversely, when the AT1 receptor is blocked, the β 2 AR is decoupled from Gα s , which leads to the loss of cAMP signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>.</s><s>However, apart from several other examples, the general physiological significance of GPCR heterodimers has been debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we found that the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-R), which is a non-OR GPCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> that is found on OSNs, potentiated the function of ORs in transfected cells.</s><s>In addition, we showed that when the M3-R was present with ORs on the same cells, M3-R agonists and antagonists respectively enhanced or inhibited OR signaling, suggesting that the activation state of the M3-R modulates OR function.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The M3-R is found in OSNs</head><p><s>To determine whether M3-R messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed by OSNs, we performed in situ hybridization assays on sections of the olfactory epithelium.</s><s>We found that M3-R was expressed in the OSNs, which can be distinguished as the cell population that contains a large abundance of mRNA for olfactory marker protein (OMP) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, A to C).</s><s>Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of sections of the olfactory epithelium to assess whether the M3-R protein colocalized with the olfactory cilia in which ORs are localized.</s><s>We found that the M3-R was localized at the cilia in the olfactory epithelium, similarly to ACIII (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, D to G).</s><s>In marked contrast, M1-R, M2-R, and M5-R proteins were low in abundance in olfactory cilia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>, and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Hence, although M1-R, M3-R, and M5-R potentiated OR signaling in vitro, only the M3-R was found in olfactory cilia, which suggests that M1-R and M5-R do not have a role in the potentiation of OR signaling and that the effect of M1-R and M5-R that we observed in vitro was likely a result of the sequence identity (&gt; 50%) among the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subfamily members, as seen when the peptide sequences for the two receptors are aligned against that of the M3-R.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The M3-R enhances the functions of various mammalian ORs</head><p><s>We addressed the question of whether the M3-R interacted with a few or many ORs by cotransfecting HEK 293T cells with plasmids encoding Rho-tagged ORs (from a set of mouse and human ORs for which ligands are known) and the accessory factor RTP1S with or without plasmid encoding the M3-R.</s><s>In each case, we observed that the M3-R enhanced the activities of ORs upon ligand stimulation by lowering the median effective concentration (EC 50 ) value of the odorant used, increasing the maximal OR response, or both (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>).</s><s>The degree of enhancement of signaling was OR-dependent; however, we observed a greater relative enhancement of signaling by the M3-R when it was co-expressed with those ORs that showed weaker responses to odorants in the absence of the M3-R.</s><s>Thus, the effect of the M3-R on the signaling of those ORs that exhibited strong responses to their ligands was relatively small.</s><s>That the M3-R interacted with a large number of diverse ORs further supports the idea that the M3-R could be physiologically important for olfactory signaling.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potentiation of ORs by the M3-R in transfected cells is modulated by muscarinic receptor agonists and antagonists</head><p><s>Given that GPCRs that form heteromeric complexes often exhibit functional co-modulation, we wanted to determine whether altering the activity of the M3-R would directly affect the odorant-mediated activation of ORs.</s><s>We cotransfected HEK 293T cells with plasmids encoding the M3-R and OR-S6, and stimulated the cells with nonanedioic acid (an OR-S6 agonist) in the presence of carbachol (a muscarinic receptor agonist) or atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist).</s><s>Carbachol alone did not induce reporter activity at the concentration that we tested (100 nM) (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref>).</s><s>Costimulation of cells with nonanedioic acid and carbachol further enhanced the activity of OR-S6 compared to that in cells treated with nonanedioic acid alone.</s><s>Conversely, the presence of atropine hindered the potentiation effect of the M3-R (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>This inhibitory effect of atropine was only observed in the presence of the M3-R, consistent with the idea that the activation state of M3-R is an important factor in determining its effect on OR signaling.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selective antagonists of the M3-R attenuate the activation of OSNs</head><p><s>If the activation state of the M3-R influenced odor responses as a result of direct receptorreceptor interactions in vivo, then it is likely that antagonists of the M3-R would inhibit the activation of OSNs.</s><s>Because the stimulation of OSNs by odorants leads to transient increases in the concentration of intracellular calcium ions (Ca 2+ ), we used Ca 2+ imaging to monitor the activation of OSNs.</s><s>We compared the responses of individual, acutely dissociated OSNs from mice to a mixture of 10 odorants or to the same mixture containing either darifenacin or pfHHSiD, two M3-R-selective antagonists.</s><s>When OSNs were stimulated with odorants containing darifenacin, the Ca 2+ responses of each OSN were substantially attenuated compared to those of OSNs exposed to odorants in the absence of darifenacin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, A and B, and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>To ensure that the attenuation of the Ca 2+ response in OSNs that was observed when darifenacin was administered with odorants was not affected by OR attenuation, we showed that changing the order in which we administered either the odorant mixture or the odorant mixture with darifenacin yielded similar results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with observations made in transfected cells (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>), the degree of inhibition was different in different neurons, which we assume expressed different ORs (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>We observed similar findings in experiments with pfHHSiD, another M3-R-selective antagonist (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>, and fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results support the idea that the M3-R enhances the function of ORs and that its activation state affects the odorant-mediated activation of ORs in OSNs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The M3-R does not increase the cell surface abundance of ORs</head><p><s>Because the cofactors RTP1S and RTP2 and the receptors β 2 AR and P2Y1 promote the cell surface trafficking of ORs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>, we hypothesized that the M3-R might play a similar role.</s><s>However, live-cell immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis of transfected HEK 293T cells expressing Rho-tagged ORs alone or in the presence of the M3-R revealed that the M3-R did not increase the relative density of OR-S6 at the cell surface, thus precluding the possibility that the M3-R functions by supporting OR trafficking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The M3-R synergizes with RTP1S but does not affect the ligand specificity of ORs</head><p><s>To determine whether the potentiation of OR signaling by the M3-R was dependent on the presence of other accessory factors, we cotransfected HEK 293T cells with plasmids encoding Rho-tagged or untagged ORs (OR-S6 or Olfr62) with a combination of plasmids encoding the M3-R, RTP1S, and Ric-8B, and we measured OR responses.</s><s>We found that whereas untagged ORs showed relatively poor responses to odorants in the presence of the M3-R or RTP1S alone, their responses were enhanced when both M3 and RTP1S were present (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>When we performed this experiment in cells with Rho-tagged ORs, we observed a similar synergism between the M3-R and RTP1S; however, the responses of the tagged ORs were substantially enhanced relative to those of the untagged receptors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>Ric-8B did not substantially affect OR responses in our assay.</s><s>These results suggest that the M3-R and RTP1S synergistically enhanced the function of ORs, indicating that the M3-R acted by enhancing the signaling of ORs that were targeted to the membrane by RTPs and further supporting the idea that the functional role of the M3-R is different from that of previously identified accessory proteins.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether functional interactions between the ORs and the M3-R altered their signaling, we stimulated HEK 293T cells that were cotransfected with plasmids encoding an OR, RTP1S, and the M3-R with forskolin, an activator of AC.</s><s>We observed enhanced responses only when OR-S6, RTP1S, and the M3-R were all present in cells, suggesting that the OR and M3-R together potentiated the activation of AC in the absence of OR ligands (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4B</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with the idea that the M3-R facilitates efficient signal transduction.</s><s>When we stimulated cells with ionomycin, a Ca 2+ ionophore, we did not detect any reporter activity, indicating that ionomycin had no effects on OR activation (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4C</ref>).</s><s>Finally, when we stimulated cells with the M3-R agonist carbachol, we observed a synergistic effect when cells were stimulated with more than 1 μM carbachol, but only when OR, RTP1S, and the M3-R were all present.</s><s>This suggests that at high concentrations of carbachol, activation of the M3-R could lead to the transactivation of ORs (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether the M3-R altered the ligand specificity of ORs, we stimulated transfected cells that had ORs in the presence or absence of the M3-R with a number of known OR ligands or with compounds that are not OR ligands.</s><s>We found that for both OR-S6 and Olfr62, the M3-R potentiated each odor-specific response without altering their relative responses to the odors, suggesting that the M3-R plays little or no role in OR ligand selectivity (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Here, we provide evidence suggesting that a non-OR GPCR may play a broad, yet functionally relevant, role in mammalian olfaction.</s><s>We showed that the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3-R specifically potentiated the activation of a diverse range of ORs.</s><s>The M3-R lowered the EC 50 value and increased the maximum responses of ORs in transfected cells.</s><s>In addition, activation of the M3-R further enhanced the responses of ORs, whereas inhibition of M3-R activity abolished these effects.</s><s>Although Liberles and Buck showed that the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), which are individually expressed in non-OR-expressing OSNs, are non-OR GPCRs that play an important role in the olfactory recognition of amine compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, we have shown the first instance in which a non-OR GPCR that is coexpressed with an OR can substantially alter the potency and efficacy of a large number of ORs.</s></p><p><s>The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are activated by the physiological ligand acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter that is found in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems.</s><s>These receptors are responsible for a broad range of functions, including the contraction of skeletal muscle and secretion by tracheal mucosa.</s><s>On the basis of our findings, the M3-R also appears to have a unique, and unexpected, role in olfactory signal transduction.</s><s>Given the extensive innervation of the olfactory mucosa by cholinergic parasympathetic neurons, it is possible that secreted acetylcholine could activate muscarinic receptors on OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</s><s>As we have shown in our transfected cell system, 100 nM carbachol was adequate to substantially potentiate OR function; hence, even a low concentration of acetylcholine, whether constitutively available or released upon OR stimulation, could improve the olfactory response.</s><s>Indeed, Hedlund and Shepherd provided the first evidence for the presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the olfactory epithelium of the salamander; moreover, they showed the presence of both choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholine esterase, further supporting the idea that acetylcholine plays a physiological role in the olfactory epithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, humans and animals show an increase in acuity in odor detection by learning.</s><s>This olfactory perceptual learning is modulated by acetylcholine <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>Although previous studies suggested the importance of changes by acetylcholine in neurons of the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex, our results raise the possibility that acetylcholine might have direct effects in the activation of ORs, thus contributing to olfactory learning at the receptor level.</s><s>In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether acetylcholine is secreted in the nasal mucus and, if so, whether modulating the amount of acetylcholine could be a mechanism through which the native functions of ORs might be regulated by the activity of the M3-R and whether changes in OR function by acetylcholine might affect olfactory learning.</s></p><p><s>The ability of GPCRs to act not simply as monomers but also as dimers or even higher-order oligomers has been reported in a number of systems; however, whether these observations are physiologically relevant has been debated in some cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Although M3-R signaling has never been proposed to play a role in olfaction, others have postulated that neurotransmitters act to modulate OR activation.</s><s>Firestein and Shepherd showed that the application of atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, substantially reduced the activation of ORs in salamander OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, consistent with the idea that the activation state of the M3-R is important for OR function.</s><s>It is possible that other non-OR GPCRs modulate the functions of ORs.</s><s>As mentioned earlier, β 2 AR and P2YRs enhance the functions of specific ORs.</s><s>Other GPCRs may also alter the functions of other subsets of ORs.</s><s>Our data appear to support this idea, because several other GPCRs from our screen appeared to enhance the function of some of the ORs that we tested (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>This implies that there may be inherent heterogeneity and complexity in OR-non-OR interactions.</s><s>In the future, it will be necessary to examine how the M3-R and other OR-modulating proteins affect OR function and what the molecular mechanism of this interaction might be.</s></p><p><s>How does the M3-R enhance OR function?</s><s>It is clear that no single paradigm can account for the diverse interactions observed between GPCR homomers and heteromers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to the ability of β 2 AR and P2YRs to increase the surface abundance of OR-M71, the M3-R did not increase the amount of ORs at the cell surface.</s><s>This is consistent with results presented by Bush et al., in which the M3-R was not identified as a potential OR modulator, precisely because they also found that co-expressing the M3-R did not increase the cell surface abundance of ORs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Our screen directly assessed OR activation, which enabled us to identify the M3-R.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to instances in which GPCR heteromers promote receptor trafficking, the stable interaction between ORs and the M3-R might lead to a change in OR conformation or ligand-induced changes in OR conformation that improve ligand binding.</s><s>Another possibility is that M3-R and OR heteromers may couple with G proteins more efficiently than do monomeric receptors.</s><s>Indeed, it has been proposed that two receptor molecules are required to fully bind with each G protein, because structural studies have shown that GPCRs form multiple points of contact with the α and βγ subunits of G proteins, which require different GPCR conformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</s><s>However, general mechanisms for GPCR cross talk may not apply to this particular instance, because the action of the M3-R is likely specific.</s><s>Although we tested a diverse set of 22 non-OR GPCRs, including multiple G qcoupled receptors, no other G q -coupled receptor showed properties similar to those of the M3-R.</s><s>This suggests that the presence of G q -coupled GPCRs is not sufficient to potentiate OR signaling and that a more specific interaction is likely required.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we showed that the interaction between the ORs and the M3-R was bidirectional.</s><s>Activated ORs directly elicited an M3-R-dependent Ca 2+ response, which was abolished in the presence of the M3-R antagonist atropine.</s><s>Transactivation has been documented for other GPCR heteromers.</s><s>For example, in the case of G i -coupled A1 adenosine receptor (A1R) and the G q -coupled P2Y1 receptor, the purinergic agonist adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) βS , which normally does not affect cAMP production, promotes a reduction in the amount of cAMP through receptor heteromers, when A1R and P2Y1 are present <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, heteromers of ORs and the M3-R may be able to couple to G q as well as to G olf/s .</s><s>We do not yet know the molecular mechanism of the interaction between the ORs and the M3-R.</s><s>As a first step, it will be important to identify the receptor domains that are required for this interaction.</s><s>Although we showed that ORs and the M3-R formed stable heteromers, we cannot exclude the possibility that the modulatory effects might be explained by complex interactions among signaling pathways that are independent of these physical interactions.</s></p><p><s>Our findings raise the possibility that the M3-R not only modulates OR activity but also plays a role in olfactory signal transduction through its own downstream targets.</s><s>One possibility is that the odor-specific activation of ORs might lead to the activation of the M3-R in olfactory cilia, which may then activate IP 3 signaling.</s><s>Although cAMP is the predominant secondary messenger system in olfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, certain odors elicit an IP 3 response in OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s><s>Although G q is not abundant in olfactory cilia <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>, the M3-R may couple with other G q family G proteins or to G o to induce the production of IP 3 in OSNs.</s><s>Future work is necessary to examine this possibility.</s><s>In summary, our results suggest that the M3-R acts specifically to modulate the responses of a number of ORs to odorants.</s><s>Some ORs and the M3-R appear to form specific, heteromeric interactions that support robust activation of these ORs, extending the concept of functional interaction to the largest class of GPCRs.</s><s>Because weak activation of ORs in transfected cell systems has been one of the major barriers in understanding olfactory signaling, this discovery is likely to lead to advances in identifying active ligands for many, thus far, orphan ORs.</s></p></div>
