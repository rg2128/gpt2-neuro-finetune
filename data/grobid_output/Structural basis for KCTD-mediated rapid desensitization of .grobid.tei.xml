<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The structure shows an unusual overall architecture, with KCTD16 BTB adopting an asymmetric pentameric arrangement and wrapping around the GABA B2 C-terminus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>).</s><s>While previous reports suggested that KCTD16 functions as a tetramer, both our structure and a recently reported peptide-free KCTD16 BTB structure showed a pentameric arrangement <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref>  (Extended Data Fig 1c).</s><s>Over a stretch of roughly 25 amino acids, nearly every side chain in the GABA B2 tail interacts with KCTD16 BTB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>).</s><s>Within the interface, KCTD16 BTB residue Phe80 makes particularly extensive contacts with the peptide in each of the five subunits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>).</s><s>Confirming the importance of these interactions, we found that an F80A mutation caused a complete loss of GABA B2 peptide binding activity in vitro (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>), and an equivalent substitution in KCTD12 resulted in loss of GABA B -mediated KCTD12 membrane localization in cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>).</s><s>Almost all residues in the interaction interface are conserved in all GABA B -regulating KCTD subtypes (KCTD8, KCTD12 and KCTD16), accounting for the specific binding of these KCTDs for GABA B receptor (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>In addition to binding the GABA B2 receptor tail, KCTDs also interact with Gβγ subunits <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>In an in vitro pull-down assay with GST-tagged KCTD12 we found that a sub-stochiometric amount of GABA B2 receptor tail but near stochiometric amounts of Gβ 1 γ 2 heterodimer could be pulled down by KCTD12.</s><s>In contrast, KCTD12 failed to co-purify Gαβγ heterotrimer irrespective of Gα subtype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>).</s><s>While the KCTD12 BTB domain mediates interaction with the receptor, its C-terminal H1 domain is responsible for desensitization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with this, we observed that the KCTD12 H1 domain alone was sufficient to bind Gβγ with an affinity of 185 nM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>; Extended Data Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>).</s><s>Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) 2D class averages of KCTD12 H1 in complex with Gβγ revealed a symmetric pentameric assembly with the H1 domain pentamer engaging in interaction with five copies of Gβγ heterodimer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To investigate the details of H1 domain interaction with Gβγ in more detail, we determined the crystal structure of the KCTD12 H1 /Gβγ complex to 3.7 Å resolution (Extended Data Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>).</s><s>In parallel, we also determined a negative-stain EM envelope for full-length KCTD12 in complex with Gβγ (Extended Data 4).</s><s>These data showed that the KCTD12 H1 /Gβγ complex is pentameric and shows near-perfect C5 symmetry.</s><s>KCTD12 H1 possesses a β-propeller-like fold, with each H1 domain comprising a separate blade of the propeller.</s><s>The propeller is surrounded by a tightly packed ring of Gβγ heterodimers in direct contact with one another.</s><s>Interactions between KCTD12 and the G protein are confined to the Gβ subunit, with Gγ subunits peripherally arrayed around the edge of the pentameric ring (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>).</s><s>Previous reports had suggested that the motif NFLEQ in KCTD12 is important for receptor desensitization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>However, in the crystal structure this region does not interact with Gβγ subunits, but instead is involved in oligomeric contacts between adjacent KCTD12 subunits (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The KCTD12 H1 domain itself consists of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet interrupted by two α helices (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>).</s><s>The five Gβγ subunits each interact with two KCTD12 H1 subunits, which together occlude a large surface on Gβ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>).</s><s>The loop between the first and second β strands of KCTD12 H1 includes basic residues which interact with an acidic patch on the Gβ propeller (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>), and a longer loop in KCTD12 H1 after the first α helix sits in the groove between the N-terminal helix of Gβγ and the β propeller domain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>).</s><s>Mutating residues in the KCTD12 H1 domain in either of these interfaces (R232D or R257D) entirely abolished G protein binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>).</s><s>Although both KCTD mutants can localize to the cell membrane in the presence of GABA B receptors (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>), they fail to desensitize GABA B -mediated GIRK channel currents (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3f</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the KCTD binding site on the surface of Gβγ would partially occlude Gα binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3g</ref>), but is entirely non-overlapping with the GIRK channel binding site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3g</ref> and 3h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Hence, binding of a KCTD12 pentamer to a single Gβγ subunit in complex with GIRK2 could be accommodated with minimal structural rearrangement, although the full 5:5 complex is incompatible due to extensive clashes between the GIRK2 intracellular domain and other KCTD12-bound Gβγ dimers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3h</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref> and<ref type="figure">6b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>One of the more remarkable features of the complex is the fact that Gβγ subunits pack so closely to one another that they interact directly, burying a 351 Å 2 surface.</s><s>In contrast, the GIRK channel is bound by four spatially isolated Gβγ subunits (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a-c</ref>).</s><s>Residues in the Gβ-Gβ interface observed in our structure are highly conserved across species, raising the possibility that this interaction is functionally important.</s><s>To test this, we incubated KCTD12 H1 with a substoichiometric amount of Gβγ.</s><s>Under these conditions, only full 5:5 complexes and free KCTD12 were seen in size exclusion chromatography, with no evidence of partial oligomers, suggesting that KCTD12 binding to Gβγ is highly cooperative (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>).</s><s>When a single Gβ residue involved in oligomeric Gβ-Gβ contacts was mutated (R42D), we observed a broad 5:5 complex peak and free Gβγ in size exclusion.</s><s>Introduction of a second mutation (R46D) resulted in only partial complex formation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6e</ref>), further supporting a role of cooperative Gβ-Gβ contacts in KCTD binding.</s></p><p><s>Gβγ is the key signaling intermediate in GABA B activation of GIRK currents, and in the course of a signaling event a Gβγ subunit sequentially interacts with a series of progressively higher affinity binding partners.</s><s>The K D 's for Gβγ binding to GTP-bound Gα i , GIRK channels, KCTD12, and GDP-bound Gα i are (in order): undetectable, ~250 μM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , 185 nM (Extended Data 3c), and 3 nM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>If Gβγ affinity for KCTDs is so much higher than for GIRK channels, how can KCTDs desensitize the channels without preventing their activation in the first place?</s><s>Clearly the on rate for Gβγ association with KCTDs must be lower than that for association with GIRK channels, otherwise Gβγ subunits would be sequestered prematurely.</s><s>We propose one possible explanation for how this might be achieved.</s><s>KCTDs bind at the distal C-terminus of the GABA receptor B2 subunit, roughly 350 Å from the last transmembrane domain with an intervening structurally rigid coiled-coil domain.</s><s>This means that KCTDs can diffuse far from the membrane plane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>When the GABA B receptor is activated, Gβγ subunits are liberated from Gα but remain tethered to the membrane due to their lipid anchor, resulting in GIRK channel activation while KCTDs are at a relatively low local concentration.</s><s>When a KCTD molecule happens to encounter a GIRK-bound Gβγ subunit it can bind simultaneously, but formation of the oligomeric complex is sterically incompatible with Gβγ binding to GIRK channels.</s><s>The higher affinity and cooperativity of binding to KCTD may then drive stripping of subsequent Gβγ subunits from GIRKs following an initial encounter, resulting in rapid channel closure.</s><s>Finally, reassociation of Gβγ with GDP-bound Gα subunits could restore equilibrium and reset the cycle (Extended Data 7).</s></p><p><s>The regulation of GABA B signaling by KCTD proteins is a unique and important means of achieving functional diversity in these critical receptors.</s><s>Here we have shown how the KCTD BTB domain recognizes the GABA B2 C-terminus to tether a Gβγ-sequestering H1 domain on the receptor's distal tail, providing a means of efficiently deactivating GIRK channels.</s><s>In this way KCTDs afford GABA B receptors with tight temporal control of signaling not achievable with the slower β-arrestin pathway used to desensitize most GPCRs.</s></p></div>
