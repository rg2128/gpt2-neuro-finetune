<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>To measure the effects of 5-HT 2A R activation on spatial and temporal processing in visual cortex, we measured visual responses in mice head-fixed on a spherical treadmill <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dombeck et al., 2007)</ref> using widefield imaging and two-photon calcium imaging, and single-unit electrophysiology with silicon probes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Following presentation of a set of visual stimuli, mice received a subcutaneous injection of either saline (control) or the 5-HT 2A R agonist DOI (10 mg/kg; see STAR Methods and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> for an explanation of dose choice), and after a 15-to 20-min waiting period, the stimulus set was repeated.</s><s>To explore how previous experience with visual stimuli may influence effects of 5-HT 2A R signaling, we performed a subset of these passive viewing experiments with animals previously trained on a visually guided task, in addition to standard non-trained animals.</s><s>As visual responses and surround suppression are modulated by behavioral state <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Niell and Stryker, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ayaz et al., 2013)</ref>, we separated data into stationary or running periods for statistical comparison.</s><s>Notably, neither pupil size nor fraction of time running was different following drug administration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), suggesting that changes observed were not due to differences in behavioral state.</s></p><p><s>Widefield imaging of cortical excitatory neurons in CaMKIIa-tTA:tetO-GCaMP6s mice (GCaMP6s mice; <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wekselblatt et al., 2016)</ref> revealed no change in the retinotopic map of azimuth and elevation in visual cortex (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>; p = 0.999, Kruskal-Wallis; see also Movie S1) but a dramatic reduction in responses to grating patches in visual areas after DOI, but not saline, administration during stationary periods (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, this reduction was larger in animals that had previously received training on a visual task than in animals naive to training (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>;
