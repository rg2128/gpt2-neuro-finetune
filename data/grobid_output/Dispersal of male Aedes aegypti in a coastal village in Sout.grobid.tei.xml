target="#b34">35</ref> reported that 72% of marked males in Thailand were found in the house adjacent to where they were released.</s></p><p><s>In our MRR experiments, the MedianDT increased slowly over time, which indicated that male daily dispersal is low (average = 15 meters/day), which is identical to the approximately 15 meters/day reported by Harrington and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> for female Ae.</s><s>aegypti.</s><s>Interestingly, a small number of males in all of our experiments moved considerably longer distances.</s><s>This finding was most evident in MRR5, when 3 marked males moved approximately 170 meters during the first 7 hours after release.</s><s>The fact that a few males rapidly moved relatively long distances in a short period could have been caused by a crowding effect from cages where males had been maintained just before release. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>To test if crowding can affect dispersal capacity, additional experiments using different holding densities are required.</s><s>Results will be useful in planning optimal release strategies for RIDL males.</s><s>However, current data indicate that most males do not engage in rapid long-range dispersal.</s></p><p><s>The spatial distribution of recaptured marked males in our experiments was highly aggregated.</s><s>More than 50% of recaptured males were always collected in only three houses that were near the release point, and most large and small marked males were collected together in the same houses.</s><s>These findings are consistent with results from spatial analyses by Getis and others. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>After two months of intensive entomologic surveys in Iquitos, Peru, they found that adult Ae. aegypti tended to cluster within single households, imply-ing that most adult Ae. aegypti do not fly far from the container where they developed as larvae.</s><s>Therefore, we speculate that without physical/ecological barriers and low wind speed, males released outdoors in groups, as was performed in our experiments, will tend to disperse short distances in any direction, and then select some preferred sites where they tend to persist and spend the great part of their adult life.</s><s>This scenario is supported by the fact that in those buildings where high numbers of marked males were collected during the first visit, a few marked individuals were collected during the second visit, indicating that they possibly escaped the first sampling and remained in the same building.</s><s>Most of these buildings were dark and humid, with dark objects (such as buckets, chairs, boxes with clothes over them, or shoes) where males were frequently collected.</s></p><p><s>Our overall recapture rate of 4.19% is in the range of that found in other studies.</s><s>Muir and Kay 29 used sticky traps and had a recapture rate of 14.8% and 4.6% for two cohorts of Ae. aegypti dusted males in northern Australia.</s><s>Using backpack aspirators and BG traps in Brazil, Maciel-de-Freitas and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> reported a recapture rate of 12.27% and 7.35% for small and large Ae.</s><s>aegypti males, respectively.</s><s>Tsuda and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> in Hainan Island, China, had a recapture rate ranging between 2.8% and 1.3%.</s><s>Harrington and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> reported a higher recapture rate (17%), and most (72%) males were recaptured in the house adjacent to the outdoor release location.</s><s>It is worth noting that in all of the above cited studies, recaptures started the same day or the day after the release, and most males were recaptured during the first day of collection.</s><s>In our study, we waited a minimum of two days in most experiments before starting collections near the release point.</s><s>This procedure gave males time to disperse or die and may help to explain why our recapture rates were somewhat reduced compared with those reported by our predecessors.</s><s>Four days after release, the number of marked males collected per day decreased dramatically.</s><s>In MRR4 we had a relatively low recapture rate of 2.64%.</s><s>An interview with the owner of the property where males were released led us to suspect that he had used insecticide just after the release.</s><s>Insecticide application could explain our low recapture rate in that experiment and why a few males were collected at relatively longer distances from the release point.</s><s>Longerrange dispersal in this case could be the consequence of the repellent effect of synthetic pyrethroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> that are commonly available in markets near our study area.</s></p><p><s>High mortality in natural environmental conditions is probably an important issue affecting our ability to detect Ae. aegypti marked males.</s><s>We infer dispersal behavior on the basis of less than 5% of released Ae. aegypti males; no information is available for the remaining 95%.</s><s>Results from our pre-trial test that was carried out to investigate survival of   marked mosquitoes in field cage conditions, indicated that after 2 weeks, only 8% of males survived with a mean daily survival rate of 0.84.</s><s>Results from our MRR experiments

Ae.</s><s>aegypti males were not recaptured because they did not survive, not because they flew out of the recapture area.</s></p><p><s>Results from our Ae.</s><s>aegypti male dispersal study provide valuable information relevant to development of male release strategies for genetic approaches to prevent dengue.</s><s>Our dispersal and survival data indicate that males will need to be released
