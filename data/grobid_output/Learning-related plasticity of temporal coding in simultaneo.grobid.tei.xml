<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Male and female Long-Evans rats (n ϭ 18; 250 -300 g at time of surgery) served as subjects in this study.</s><s>Animals were maintained on a 12 h light/dark schedule and were given ad libitum access to chow and water, unless otherwise specified.</s><s>All methods complied with the Brandeis University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgery</head><p><s>Rats were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/ xylazine/acepromazine mixture (100 mg/kg, 5.2 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg, respectively), with supplemental intraperitoneal injections administered as needed.</s><s>Each anesthetized rat was placed in a standard stereotaxic device, where its scalp was excised, and holes were bored in its skull for the insertion of 0-80 ground screws and electrode bundles.</s><s>Multielectrode bundles [16 nichrome microwires attached to a microdrive <ref type="bibr">(Katz et al., 2001b)</ref>] were inserted 0.5 mm above GC [anteroposterior (AP), 1.4 mm; mediolateral (ML) Ϫ5 mm; dorsoventral (DV), Ϫ4.5 mm from dura] and BLA (AP, Ϫ3 mm; ML, Ϫ5.1 mm; DV, Ϫ6.5 mm from dura).</s><s>Once in place, the assemblies were cemented to the skull, along with two intraoral cannulas (IOCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fontanini and Katz, 2006)</ref>, using dental acrylic.</s><s>Rats were given 7 d to recover from the surgery.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CTA protocol</head><p><s>Adaptation.</s><s>After recovery and throughout the CTA protocol, rats were maintained on 45 min/d water restriction to ensure adequate motivation to drink.</s><s>Each rat was adapted to the conditioning context for 9 d: for the first 2 of these days, it was placed in the testing chamber for 30 min; for each of the next 7 d, the fluid delivery tubing was affixed to its head.</s><s>Rats were adapted both to slow infusions of 5 ml of water (delivered through one IOC at a rate of 0.5 ml/min) and to 50 l pulses (35 per session) delivered at a frequency of 3/min.</s></p><p><s>Training.</s><s>After the adaptation sessions, each rat received a single training session.</s><s>This session was identical to adaptation sessions, except that water was replaced with 0.15% saccharin as an oral stimulus.</s><s>Video of the rat's facial responses to saccharin delivery was recorded to digital video disc.</s><s>Five minutes after the termination of saccharin exposure, the rat was given an intraperitoneal injection of LiCl (0.15 M, 2% body weight) to induce gastric distress.</s><s>Rats were returned to their home cages immediately after LiCl injection, to ensure that they would not form conditioned place aversions to the testing chamber.</s></p><p><s>Testing.</s><s>Twenty-four hours after training, the rat received a testing session, identical to the training session, in which the acquisition of CTA was measured and neural responses to saccharin were again recorded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control conditions</head><p><s>An additional group of rats (n ϭ 4) received "sham" CTAs, in which a benign 0.9% saline solution was substituted for LiCl in posttraining injections.</s><s>Neural data collected from these rats allowed us to test whether learning-independent aspects of the protocol (repeated sessions of taste delivery, i.p. injections, etc) caused modifications of taste responses in and of themselves.</s><s>Another group of control rats (n ϭ 2) received CTAs to 0.1 M NaCl (delivered orally) before receiving sham conditioning with saccharin; neural data collected from these rats allowed us to test the possibility that the experience of sickness might change taste responses.</s><s>A third group of rats (n ϭ 3) received CTAs to saccharin, but were then exposed to NaCl as a taste on the testing day (to avoid confusion, we will refer to NaCl used as an oral/taste stimulus as "NaCl," and refer to sham i.p. injections as "saline").</s><s>These rats received a second testing session with saccharin 24 h later.</s><s>This condition allowed us to test whether successful CTAs were solely related to the taste delivered during the testing session, and not to contextual elements of the experimental procedures (no neural activity was recorded in this last control group).</s></p><p><s>In all regards other than those described above, experimental procedures used with control rats were identical to those used with CTA rats.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CTA quantification</head><p><s>Rats produce stereotyped, easily observed behaviors when an aversive stimulus is in the mouth [i.e., gapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grill and Norgren, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Spector et al., 1988)</ref>].</s><s>A significant increase in the number of gapes elicited by saccharin after training (by paired t test) served as evidence for learning here, as it has in many previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Breslin et al., 1992)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrophysiology</head><p><s>Neural signals were collected from BLA and GC during taste sampling in both training and testing sessions.</s><s>Differential recordings were fed into a parallel processor capable of digitizing up to 32 signals at 40 kHz simultaneously (Plexon, Dallas, TX).</s><s>Discriminable action potentials of no less than 3:1 S/N ratio were isolated on-line from each signal using an amplitude criterion in cooperation with a template algorithm.</s><s>Discriminations were checked continuously throughout each session.</s><s>Time-stamped records of stimulus onset and neuronal spikes were saved digitally, as were all sampled spike waveforms and the discrimination file <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nicolelis et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Off-line reanalysis incorporating three-dimensional cluster cutting techniques confirmed and corrected on-line discriminations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining stable single-unit recordings across training/testing days of CTA</head><p><s>To characterize the direct effects of CTA on individual neuronal taste responses, we examined neurons that remained stably isolated across the 24 h between prelearning and postlearning sessions.</s><s>The stability of microwire bundles makes this feat feasible <ref type="bibr">(Katz et al., 2001b)</ref>.</s><s>To statistically evaluate the stability of our unit isolations, average action potential waveforms from training and testing sessions were first mapped into a three-dimensional principal component space using commercially available spike-sorting software (Wavetracker; Plexon).</s><s>Multivariate ANO-VAs (mANOVAs) allowed a comparison of the waveforms recorded on a particular electrode during training and testing days of CTA.</s><s>As a control comparison, training sessions were divided into thirds, and mANOVAs were used to compare the first and last third of the spikes recorded within the single session.</s><s>These sessions were at most 12.5 min long; thus, the compared sets of waveforms in this control condition were typically separated by a 4 min interval, an interval that all but ensures waveform stability.</s><s>Waveforms were only described as coming from the same single neuron across training and testing sessions if the multivariate F value comparing the two sessions was in the same range as those for the withinsession comparisons (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>, available at www.jneurosci.</s><s>org as supplemental material); in practice, this criterion led us to define neurons as having been held across learning only if the training and testing waveforms were determined to have a Ͻ0.05 probability of being different.</s></p><p><s>An empirical demonstration of the validity of this approach comes from recordings made from control rats: in the absence of learning, neurons deemed to have been held across sessions almost always responded the same to saccharin in tests separated by 24 h (see below).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection of lick-rate modulation in somatosensory neurons</head><p><s>Some neurons in GC respond to somatosensory stimulation of the tongue and oral cavity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Yamamoto et al., 1988)</ref>.</s><s>These neurons fire action potentials synchronized to the rhythmic (6 -9 Hz) licking behavior produced by the rat during taste sampling <ref type="bibr">(Katz et al., 2001a)</ref>.</s><s>This spectral signature allowed us to identify and then remove such neurons from further analysis, and thus to ensure that motor behaviors (which change with CTA) would not confound response plasticity related to taste quality and/or palatability coding.</s><s>Power spectral density plots (256 frequency values sampled between 2 and 30 Hz) were used to determine which neurons, across an entire session, produced peaks between 6 and 9 Hz.</s><s>Peaks in this range of at least 1.5 SDs above the average 2-30 Hz power were considered somatosensory neurons, and these neurons were removed from analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of GC and BLA taste responses</head><p><s>Time-averaged responses (firing rate averaged across the first 2.5 s after taste delivery) were compared with the averaged baseline firing rate (1.5 s of prestimulus activity) using paired t tests, with taste responsiveness determined by a significant change from baseline (note that although learning sometimes caused subtle changes in spontaneous activity, all results described here were qualitatively similar for raw and normalized responses).</s><s>␣ values were set to 0.01, unless spontaneous and evoked firing rates were very low (i.e., Ͻ1 spike/s), in which case a slightly less conservative ␣ value of 0.05 was used.</s><s>This adjustment was made because fewer spikes result in a smaller sample from which to run inferential statistics.</s><s>To determine the temporal properties of a taste response, we ran similar analyses on responses divided into consecutive 250 ms bins.</s><s>Finally, we performed a dynamic moving window analysis on the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of each neuron <ref type="bibr">(Katz et al., 2001a)</ref>, to determine the onset and offset times at which firing rates changed from baseline (and the durations of these modulations).</s></p><p><s>Initial analyses of how learning affected saccharin responses were performed in full neural ensembles, without regard to whether or not the neurons were held across sessions, using the 250 ms bin analysis described above.</s><s>The percentage of training session neurons that produced significant saccharin responses in each bin was compared with the percentage of testing session neurons that produced significant saccharin responses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of neurons held from before until after learning</head><p><s>To more rigorously and directly examine the effects of CTA on GC and BLA taste responses, we analyzed the subset of units recorded across both days of CTA training/testing.</s><s>Paired t tests were used to compare firing rate responses on consecutive days, first using 2.5 s and then 250 ms bins.</s><s>Statistical p values were set as described above.</s></p><p><s>Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to compare the time courses of pre-and post-CTA population responses to saccharin <ref type="bibr">(Stopfer et al.,</ref><ref type="bibr">03)</ref>.</s><s>For each neuron, the response to the stimulus was averaged across trials and divided in consecutive 100 ms bins.</s><s>PCA was performed on two n ϫ m matrices (one for prelearning and the other for postlearning), where n ϭ the number of neurons and m ϭ the number of time bins (25 bins of 100 ms duration, for a total poststimulus time of 2.5 s).</s><s>The time course of the similarity was computed by measuring the Euclidean distance between homologous points of the two matrices in multidimensional space.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of functional connectivity between BLA and GC</head><p><s>Functional connectivity was determined by measuring the crosscorrelations between spike trains of simultaneously recorded BLA and GC neuron pairs (held throughout real or "sham" learning).</s><s>Pairs were constructed of each pair of held neurons; if, for instance, two BLA and three GC neurons were held across learning in one rat, six amygdalacortical neuron pairs were analyzed for that rat.</s><s>Correlated activity was examined for both spontaneous activity and saccharin responses in CTA rats, and for saccharin responses in control rats.</s><s>To ensure a stable analysis of cross-correlations during saccharin responses, 4 s of poststimulus time was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Katz et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The absolute value of the crosscorrelation peak was measured within Ϫ500 and ϩ500 ms of the spike of each "master" neuron of the pair.</s><s>To remove cross-correlations that could be attributed to common drive onto both neurons (i.e., that did not have to do with actual interactions between the recorded neuron pair), the "optimal shift predictors" (cross-correlations made after the trials of one of the neurons are shuffled; essentially cross-correlations between the two PSTHs with trial-to-trial coherence ignored) were subtracted from the cross-correlations made from the original data <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Perkel et al., 1967)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histology</head><p><s>After the experimental sessions, subjects were deeply anesthetized and perfused through the heart with saline followed by 10% formalin in saline.</s><s>Seven seconds of DC current (7 A) were passed through selected microwires in preparation for staining.</s><s>Brains were removed and immersed in a sucrose formalin mixture, where they remained, refrigerated, until fixed.</s><s>Sections (40 m) cut through the implanted areas on a freezing microtome were stained with Prussian blue for ferrous deposits blasted off of the electrode tips, and counterstained with cresyl violet for cell bodies.</s></p></div>
