<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Animal surgery.</s><s>All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan and the animal experiment committee of the University of Tokyo.</s><s>Experiments were performed on 64 male adult mice (C57BL/6; 11-15 weeks of age; 20 -30 g; Japan SLC).</s><s>Animals were first injected with medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg) for induction of anesthesia.</s><s>After 15 min, ketamine (22.5 mg/kg) was injected as deep anesthesia for preparation surgery (heart rate, 150 -200/ min).</s><s>For anesthesia during recording, we used pentothal sodium, which enabled us to perform the optical imaging, physiological recording, and animal recovery after recordings to trace their axons.</s><s>At 2.5 h after ketamine injection when the effect of ketamine had decayed (heart rate, 300/min), pentothal sodium (25 mg/kg) was injected to maintain light anesthesia during recordings (heart rate, 300 -350/min).</s><s>Adequate anesthesia was confirmed by the lack of withdrawal responses to forelimb pinching.</s><s>Additional doses of pentothal sodium were given when necessary.</s><s>Animals were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (SR-6N; Narishige).</s><s>Body temperature was maintained at 37.5°C using a homeothermic heatpad system (MK-900; Muromachi).</s><s>Respiratory rhythms (plethysmograph) were detected using a piezoelectric transducer (MLT 1010; ADInstruments).</s></p><p><s>Odor stimulation.</s><s>The compounds 2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) (Contech) and 2-methylbutyric acid (2MBA) (Tokyo Kasei) were used for odor stimulation in the optical imaging and electrophysiological experiments.</s><s>Odorants were delivered using a computer-controlled custom-built olfactometer as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yoshida and Mori, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The duration of each odor application was 6 s for optical imaging and 4 s for electrophysiological recordings, with at least 30 s interstimulus intervals to avoid habituation.</s></p><p><s>For the concentration series, TMT and 2MBA were diluted with mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) to concentrations of 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 , 3.3 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 , 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 , 3.3 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 , 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 , 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ2 , and 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ1 (v/v).</s><s>The performance of the olfactometer was tested for concentration precision using a gas chromatograph (Hitachi; G-3000) fitted with a flame ionization detector.</s><s>The relationship between output vapor concentrations from the olfactometer and the concentrations of the loaded solution were calibrated from five concentrations with linear regression (r ϭ 0.99; p ϭ 0.0011).</s><s>Vapor concentrations were then computed from the calibration line as <ref type="bibr">1.5, 3.2, 7.1, 15, 35, 170, and 830</ref> parts per billion (ppb) for 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 , 3.3 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 , 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 , 3.3 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 , 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 , 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ2 , and 1.0 ϫ 10 Ϫ1 solutions, respectively.</s><s>Concentrations of 2MBA were also calibrated using the gas chromatograph as 0. <ref type="bibr">79, 2.8, 10, 35, 126, 447, 1585, and 19,950</ref> ppb for

signals.</s><s>Detailed procedures for the optical imaging have been described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Uchida et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Images were analyzed using IDL (Research Systems) and MATLAB (MathWorks) software.</s><s>A differential image was obtained by dividing the magnitude of signals acquired during odorant stimulation (frames 9 -12) by those acquired before stimulation (frames 1-4).</s><s>A Gaussian spatial filter was used to eliminate nonspecific global darkening and highfrequency noise of the differential image (cutoff frequencies, ϭ 70.0/mm for the high cutoff and ϭ 0.4/mm for the low cutoff).</s><s>To achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio, these filtered images were averaged for at least five trials.</s><s>The pixel intensities of the images with stimulus were compared by t test with those with blank (pure air) stimulus.</s><s>TMT-or 2MBA-responsive glomeruli ( p Ͻ 0.01, t test) were overlaid on the image of the blood vessels and used for the electrophysiological experiments.</s></p><p><s>Electrophysiological recordings and single-cell labeling.</s><s>Single-unit recording and single-neuron labeling were performed using the juxtacellular recording technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pinault, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>A small area (1 ϫ 1 mm) of the bone above the TMT-or 2MBA-responsive glomeruli was removed with fine forceps.</s><s>A glass micropipette (tip diameter, 0.5-1.0</s><s>m; impedance, 40 -80 M⍀) filled with 0.1 M potassium acetate, pH 7.5, containing 12% biotinylated dextran amine (BDA-3000) (Invitrogen) was lowered near the responsive glomeruli.</s><s>MCs and TCs responsive to TMT or 2MBA were searched randomly from a 300 ϫ 300 m area that spanned 0 -300 m posteriorly and medially from the peak of the intrinsic signal.</s><s>Once a single unit was extracellularly recorded and identified, the micropipette was then slowly advanced toward the neuron until the spike amplitude became Ͼ1 mV.</s><s>Odor-evoked activities (more than five trials for each odor concentration) were recorded with an amplifier (MEZ-8300; Nihon Kohden), filtered (150 -10 kHz; AB-651J; Nihon Kohden), and stored in the computer via an AD converter with the Spike2 software package (Cambridge Electronic Design).</s></p><p><s>After the recording, neurons were electroporated to inject BDA by passage of positive current pulses (0.5-1.5 nA; 400 ms duration; 50% duty cycle) through the bridge circuit of the amplifier.</s><s>The firing of the recorded neuron was continuously monitored during and after the current injection to ensure that the neuron was steadily held throughout the session.</s><s>For axonal tracing in the OC, the current injection was continued for Ͼ30 min.</s><s>Only one neuron was labeled per each olfactory bulb in samples for axon reconstruction experiments.</s><s>Since TMT-and 2MBAresponsive neurons are located distant enough (ϳ1 mm) to be distinguished, either or both the TMT and 2MBA-responsive neurons were labeled in experiments without axon reconstruction.</s></p><p><s>Neuronal and respiration data analysis.</s><s>Analyses of respiration and spike responses were performed off-line using the Spike2 and MATLAB software packages.</s></p><p><s>Detection of respiration cycles.</s><s>To establish the fidelity of the respiration timing measurements, pilot experiments were performed (n ϭ 3 mice) to compare signals from piezoelectric transducer (plethysmograph) and temperature sensor (thermocouple) inserted directly in the nostril (1).</s><s>Onsets of inhalation (OI T ) were first determined from troughs (start of cooling) in the thermocouple signals.</s><s>Inhalation timings were next detected by plethysmograph using peaks in the derivative of plethysmograph (i.e., acceleration of chest movement), since these peaks (P dP ) were closer to OI T than peaks in the raw signal.</s><s>Deflection between OI T and P dP was 28 Ϯ 0.8°in respiration cycles (n ϭ 2000 respirations, 3 mice).</s><s>Inhalation onsets were thus defined as the time point 28°ahead of P dP in the following experiments.</s><s>Exhalation onsets and offsets were also assessed by comparing thermocouple and plethysmograph signals, and defined as time points 3°ahead and 80°after troughs in plethysmograph signals, respectively.</s><s>Temporal delay from solenoid valve onset to odor arrival at the tip of the outlet nozzle (D VO ) was calculated as 393 ms from a dead volume of tubings and the flow rate of the olfactometer.</s><s>Thus, the odor arrival time was estimated to be 393 ms after the solenoid valve onset time.</s><s>Onset of the first respiration just after the odor arrival time was defined as the onset of actual odor stimulation.</s></p><p><s>Peristimulus time histograms.</s><s>Response spikes evoked by odor stimulation were aligned at first inhalation onsets just after the odor stimuli onsets for multiple trials.</s><s>Peristimulus time histograms were then calculated using a Gaussian filter (SD, 25 ms).</s></p><p><s>Peristimulus phase histograms.</s><s>To clearly demonstrate the spike responses and respiration phases (inspiration-expiration) evoked by odor concentration series, peristimulus phase histograms were used.</s><s>Inhalation onsets were defined as 0°in each respiration cycle.</s><s>In each respiration, spikes were binned (1 respiration ϭ 20 bins), and the firing rate (in spikes/second) was calculated for each bin using the actual duration (in seconds) of the bin.</s><s>Respiration cycles were aligned by the cycle number after the odor stimulus onset.</s><s>Bins were then averaged across trials and processed using a Gaussian filter (SD, 36°).</s></p><p><s>Reliability index.</s><s>To assess how informative the firing response of a neuron to a particular stimulus was compared with spontaneous firings, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used, which has been widely used for comparing neuronal responses to different stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cury and Uchida, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>ROC curves were plotted for true-positive rate as a function of false-positive rate for mean firing rates between odor and blank trials.</s><s>The area under the ROC curve (auROC) was used as a measure of the reliability of the stimulus response compared with spontaneous firing.</s><s>An auROC value of 0.5 indicates that the stimulus cannot be detected; an auROC value of 1 corresponds to a stimulus that can be perfectly detected.</s><s>Then, a metric, "reliability index," defined as RI ϭ 2*(auROC Ϫ 0.5), was used, where RI of 0 indicates that the response is not informative, and RI of 1 indicates that it is perfectly informative.</s><s>ROC analysis was performed using 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ms bins.</s><s>For each bin, the statistical significance of RI compared with the RI value of 0 was assessed with a z test ( p Ͻ 0.05).</s><s>Statistically significant bins that emerged earliest after the first inhalation onsets from odor stimulus onset (RI ES ) were then determined.</s><s>Cells that demonstrated RI ES during the first respiration after 830 ppb TMT or 19,950 ppb 2MBA stimulation were defined as TMT-or 2MBA-responsive cells, respectively, and cells without RI ES were discarded from our cell database.</s><s>Note that cells can use any temporal bin size for encoding RI ES .</s><s>For assessing spontaneous firings, spike firings to blank mineral oil stimulations or prestimulus firing during a respiration that precede 10 respirations before stimulus onset were used.</s><s>No difference was observed in spike firings between mineral oil stimulations and prestimulus firings (n ϭ 8 cells).</s></p><p><s>Tracer visualization.</s><s>After a survival period of 3 d, the animals were administered an overdose of anesthetic and perfused transcardially with saline followed by a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB) (0.1 M), pH 7.4.</s><s>Brains were embedded in egg yolk, postfixed overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PB for 2-3 d.</s><s>Consecutive parasagittal sections (50 m thickness) were obtained from individual brain hemispheres using a cryostat (HM500-M; Carl Zeiss).</s><s>Using the free-floating method, sections
