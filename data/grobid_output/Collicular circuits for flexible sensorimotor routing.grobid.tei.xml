Pierrot-Deseilligny et al., 1991a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sigman and Dehaene, 2005)</ref>, as well as with a large body of work in the SC centered on its spatiomotor functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gandhi and Katnani, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Classic studies of the SC intermediate and deep layers have focused on their critical role in generating spatial orienting movements in learned behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Felsen and Mainen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Robinson, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Schiller and Stryker, 1972</ref>;

<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Krauzlis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wolf et al., 2015)</ref>, but all strictly within the confines of spatial processing.</s></p><p><s>Here, we report evidence that the SC encodes, and is required for, non-spatiomotor processes.</s><s>We recorded neural activity of SC and PFC populations in rats performing a rapid task switching behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Duan et al., 2015)</ref>, where rats exert executive control and demonstrate behavioral hallmarks that closely parallel those found in analogous primate paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Everling and DeSouza, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Munoz and Everling, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Weiler and Heath, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, taking advantage of high time resolution optogenetic silencing tools available in rodents, we examined the requirement of the SC for different phases of the task.</s><s>We found that during a non-spatial task encoding delay period, before spatial response choices could be formed, the SC population contained significantly more information about non-spatial task context identity than the PFC population.</s><s>Moreover, bilateral silencing of the SC during the same non-spatial delay period impaired behavioral accuracy.</s><s>In contrast, bilateral silencing that began once spatial choices could begin to be formed did not impair choice accuracy.</s><s>This was true even though during this period SC neurons contained earlier and stronger information than PFC neurons about the upcoming spatial response choice, which suggested that the SC plays an important role in generating those spatial choices.</s><s>To account for these behavioral, electrophysiological, and perturbation data we developed a dynamical model framework and found numerous, highly varied model circuit architectures that were compatible with these results, with the SC models involved in both generating the spatial choices and in non-spatial task context processing.</s></p><p><s>Despite heterogenous parameter values and circuit dynamics, the many model solutions consistently performed the behavior by encoding task context and inhibiting task inappropriate responses within the SC itself, in a manner consistent with our electrophysiological and optogenetic data.</s><s>These results argue against cortical inhibition of collicular activity as the key mechanism for executive control (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al., 1991a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ridderinkhof et al., 2004)</ref>, and instead suggest that the active representation of the non-spatial, relevant task goal in SC neurons is essential for flexible sensorimotor routing.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SC and PFC populations encode task context and motor choice during rapid task switching</head><p><s>We trained rats to perform rapid task switching in a behavior in which two different task contexts require opposite sensorimotor orienting responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Duan et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>On each trial, rats are first presented with an non-spatial auditory cue indicating the task context in effect for the current trial (labelled either the 'Pro' or 'Anti' context).</s><s>This is followed by a silent memory delay period, and then by a spatial choice period during which a visual stimulus to one side is turned on; in the Pro context rats are required to orient toward it while in the Anti context they should orient away (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1B</ref>).</s><s>This final choice period, beginning when the side light is turned on, is when spatial sensory information first becomes available, to be combined with the non-spatial task context information in order to perform the correct sensorimotor transformation and produce the correct spatial orienting response.</s><s>We previously found that rats can flexibly switch between these two task contexts from one trial to the next , and display multiple behavioral asymmetries between Pro and Anti responses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">S1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Duan et al., 2015)</ref>, that are similar to those observed in a closely related primate paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Everling and DeSouza, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Munoz and Everling, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Weiler and Heath, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>These asymmetries indicate the Pro task as a stimulus-driven task, while the Anti task is more cognitively demanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Duan et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To investigate neural representations in SC and PFC, we recorded well-isolated single units in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC (215 neurons; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">S2</ref>; STAR Methods), and in the prelimbic region of the medial PFC (331 neurons), from 7 rats performing the ProAnti task-switching behavior.</s><s>Individual neurons in the SC and PFC displayed firing rates that depended on, and therefore encoded, task context (Pro or Anti) as well as the subsequent spatial motor choice (Left or Right; Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1C-H</ref>).</s><s>Similar to observations in prefrontal cortex during cognitive tasks (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1F-H</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Everling et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Felsen and Mainen, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In both populations, we observed neurons that fired more on the Pro or the Anti task trials (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1F</ref>); and neurons that were selective for orienting responses ipsi-or contralateral to the recorded side (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1E</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1H</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Erlich et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Felsen and Mainen, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to past rodent studies of the SC using delayed response tasks, the encoding of ProAnti task context here is dissociated from motor planning, as supported by the lack of spatial coding before the choice period (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1E</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1H</ref>).</s><s>An initial inspection of the entire SC population revealed no apparent correlation between task and choice preference (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">S4A</ref>) or clear temporal order of Pro versus Anti task selectivity.</s><s>Given the heterogeneous and multiplexed nature of single neuron responses (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">2A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">2B</ref>), we focused on the representation of task variables on the population level (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>To evaluate the amount of task information in SC versus PFC populations, we used a cross-validated linear decoding approach (STAR Methods; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pagan et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Although both populations contained abovechance task information throughout the trial duration, decoding for whether a trial was Pro or Anti was significantly more accurate in the SC than in the PFC for equally-sized populations (p&lt;0.01, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">2C</ref>; n=193), even after controlling for firing rate differences between the two areas (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">S3A</ref>).</s><s>The stronger task information in the SC could only be matched when the number of neurons in a simulated PFC population was 5 times larger than the SC population (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">S3B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition, left versus right choice information appeared significantly earlier in SC than in PFC (latency difference = 191 ± 23 ms; p&lt;0.01, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">2D</ref>).</s><s>This choice information latency difference is not a result of firing rate differences between the two populations (Figure .</s><s>S3A), and cannot be reduced by increasing the number of PFC neurons in a pseudo-population (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">.
