fundamental roles in the decision-making process.</s><s>First, in decision situations, expected rewards act as incentives, which determine choices and increase the amount of motor or cognitive effort one is willing to expend to reach a goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berridge, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schmidt et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Second, after a decision has been enacted and the action effectuated, the obtained reward, or the absence of reward, drives important learning processes: successful actions are reinforced, while unsuccessful ones are discouraged <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sutton and Barto, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Despite rewards being strongly associated with subjective feelings, notably with emotions and with the notion of expected pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berridge and Robinson, 2003)</ref>, recent studies have reported that reward cues that are masked from awareness can still directly influence task performance <ref

awareness in the human brain to facilitate human performance (but for results challenging this view, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bijleveld et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, little is known about whether and how the second role of rewards (i.e., the propensity to reinforce successful actions) is modulated by awareness.</s></p><p><s>To address this question, thirty-two participants performed a probabilistic reversal learning task in which we manipulated the visibility of reward using a standard masking technique.</s><s>Participants were instructed to choose one of two response options, which led probabilistically either to a significant reward (a 50 cent coin, "reward condition") or a negligible one (a 1 cent coin, "noreward condition").</s><s>Response-reward contingencies reversed several times over the course of the experiment, and participants were instructed to select the response option that was most often rewarded (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Masked (M) and unmasked (UM) feedback were mixed within blocks to explore the relative weighting of both types of feedback.</s><s>We combined EEG measurements with computational modeling to investigate, at the time of reward processing and on a trial-by-trial basis, the neural correlate of the different processes influencing participants' future choices and how those were affected by reward visibility.</s><s>Thereby, the present work builds on previous studies that have linked reinforcement learning (RL) models to human neural data obtained from both fMRI

different levels of awareness, it is rather difficult to connect these neural signals to precise cognitive processes, using cross-trial averaging and traditional contrast-based ERP methods <ref

error (signed PE), the level of surprise (unsigned PE), and switch/stay behavior on the next trial.</s><s>This analysis revealed a striking similarity of neural PE correlates after both unmasked and masked reward outcomes, although weaker for the latter.</s><s>Both the early and mid-latency negative ERP components were associated with PE computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fouragnan et al. 2017)</ref>, whereas the parietal P3 was not.</s><s>These findings support previous results showing that the FRN reflects signed PE signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Holroyd and Coles,

level of surprise is also encoded in parietal EEG fluctuations elicited by masked reward outcomes.</s><s>Finally, the EEG switch/repeat correlations that we report here are in line with those of

modeling and RL, it has been shown that this neural event did not differ when participants received actual reward about their choice or merely fictive reward.</s><s>Here we show that this effect likely repre-sents decision strategies that are formed over longer timescales.</s><s>Overall, these results show that several cognitive processes important for reward-based learning, namely PE computation, surprise, and switch/stay implementation, are processed in the human brain, and that these cognitive processes are temporally and spatially dissociated in time <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future directions, open questions, and limitations</head><p><s>Although several crucial question about the role of feedback awareness in reward-based learning were addressed here, several interesting questions remain unanswered.</s><s>First, the current task design did not allow us to analyze what neural processes may drive "correct switching behavior" versus switching behavior in general, due to the low number of block reversals and therefore the low number of possible correct switch trials (maximum, 11 trials/subject).</s><s>Future studies may address this issue by incorporating more volatile reward environments, containing more block reversals (and therefore correct switches), to address this issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Behrens et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Another open question relates to the isolation of the neural and cognitive processes underlying the early versus mid-latency frontal ERP negativities.</s><s>Previous studies have typically observed only one frontal negativity (the FRN), instead of two <ref type="bibr">(Cohen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>At present, it remains unclear why this is the case, and future work is necessary to unravel the task specifics that may drive these differences between studies.</s><s>The combination of both EEG and fMRI, as performed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Debener et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hauser et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fouragnan et al., 2017)</ref>, may contribute to this endeavor.</s><s>Finally, future studies are crucial to explore what factors may drive that the model-based single-trial regressions yielded weaker (but often still significant) effects for the masked condition compared with the unmasked condition.</s><s>An interesting option may be that on a subset of trials masked feedback could have been completely missed by the system, such that no prediction error could be generated (and represented in the EEG).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure1.</s><s>Experimental setup and behavior.</s><s>a, Two response options (white boxes on the left/right of fixation) were shown on the screen until a response was given.</s><s>A correct response was rewarded with a 70% probability (50 cent coin) and not rewarded with a 30% probability (1 cent coin).</s><s>Reward visibility was manipulated by masking.</s><s>Unmasked (long coin presentation, short backward mask presentation) and masked (short coin presentation, long backward mask presentation) reward trials were mixed within blocks and randomly chosen across trials (each with a 50% probability).</s><s>Which response option was most rewarded changed every 75-125 trials.</s><s>b, The percentage of switches, at the group level (in black) and for individual subjects (in gray) after specific trials.</s><s>M: masked; UM: unmasked; ϩ: reward; Ϫ: no-reward; error bars represent Ϯ s.e.m.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,148.43,135.08,64.09,51.07" type="bitmap" /></figure>
