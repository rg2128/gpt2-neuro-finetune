<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>One of the most intriguing characteristics of the striatum is the random spatial distribution and high degree of intermingling between its D1-(direct) and D2-(indirect) projection systems, a feature that is actively promoted developmentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref> and that has been meticulously retained throughout evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref>.</s><s>The result is a highly entropic binary mosaic that extends through an expansive and homogenous space and that is mostly devoid of histological boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(34)</ref>.</s><s>Such organization is unusual in the brain, and can be seen as an adaptation to provide an optimal postsynaptic scaffold for the integration of regionally meaningful neuromodulatory signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref>.</s><s>In such a plain, borderless, environment, the rules established locally by D1 and D2-SPNs are likely to be critical in defining functional territoriality throughout the striatum, and this, we propose, is the key process shaping striatal-dependent learning.</s></p><p><s>Our study suggests that the striatum takes full advantage of this 'one-to-one' binary mosaic structure, in which activated D2-SPNs access and modify developing behavioral programs encoded by regionally defined ensembles of transcriptionally active D1-SPNs (what we call D2-to-D1 trans-modulation).</s><s>We propose that this process is slow, as it depends on the molecular integration of additive neuromodulatory signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, but could, with time, create the regional functional boundaries that are necessary to identify and shape specific learning in the striatum.</s><s>A good example of this sort of dynamic, persistent, neuromodulation is the recently described 'wave-like' motion of DA signals throughout the medio-lateral axis of the striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref>.</s><s>Beyond offering a broad solution to the credit assignment problem, recurrent waves of neuromodulatory activity in defined striatal areas could provide the kind of unbiased signal that, in the context of the molecular dichotomies established by D1 and D2 receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, could shape the striatal mosaic into meaningful transcriptional motifs.</s><s>In the case of extinction learning, as observed here, noisy alternations between DA rich and DA lean states within the DMS appears to generate a mixed population of activated SPNs comprising both D1 and D2 systems.</s><s>This regional overlap lays the groundwork for the local 'one-to-one' modulation that shapes and integrates new learning, rewriting outdated D1-SPN function in the case of extinction learning, and segregating new and exerting territories of plasticity in the case of action-outcome identity reversal.</s></p><p><s>Our findings also suggest that the local bijective function of striatal mosaic modulation does not exclusively depend on DA prediction error-like signals, but likely encompasses other sources of local modulation, which are very abundant and heterogeneous in the striatum and that also have sharp dichotomic influence on SPN subtypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>.</s><s>One example-amongst many-is acetylcholine, which is locally sourced but tightly bound to DA <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref>, has an asymmetric influence over SPN subtypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref> and has been shown to be critical for shaping goal-directed learning in the striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31)</ref>.</s><s>Clearly, a more detailed understanding will be needed to determine the precise mechanisms that lead to the</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Nucleosomal response mapping reveals learning-related territories in the striatum.</s><s>(A) Mice were trained to associate an action (lever press) with an outcome (food pellet) (fig.</s><s>S1).</s><s>(B) Immunodetection of phosphorylated nucleosomes (phospho-Ser10-histone H3;
