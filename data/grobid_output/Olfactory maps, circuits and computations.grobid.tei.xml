<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anatomy of the Olfactory System</head><p><s>The anatomy of the mammalian olfactory system has been elaborated over the last century using a combination of anatomical tracing, genetics, imaging and electrophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>Specialized olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which detect odorants via expression of odorant receptor (OR) proteins, are distributed across the nasal epithelium.</s><s>Although a typical mammalian genome encodes hundreds of potential OR genes, each OSN is thought to exclusively express one type of OR protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Every neuron expressing a given OR sends its axon to a genetically stereotyped region of neuropil on the surface of the olfactory bulb, termed a glomerulus, where it forms synapses with projection neurons whose cell bodies reside deeper in the bulb.</s><s>Each OR is thought to bind odorants through interactions with specific molecular features, and on the whole ORs exhibit relatively loose tuning across odor space.</s><s>Thus odors activate a specific spatiotemporal pattern of activity within glomeruli distributed across the olfactory bulb that can be taken to encode odor identity, as any given odorant activates a unique constellation of glomeruli whose spatial distribution is conserved from animal to animal.</s><s>The primary projection neurons of the olfactory bulb, mitral and tufted (M/T) cells, each innervate a single bulbar glomerulus and elaborate axons that fasciculate and form the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), which courses along the ventro-lateral surface of the brain.</s><s>Due to differences in intrinsic properties and intrabulbar processing, mitral and tufted cells exhibit distinct odor tuning and response properties, with tufted cells responding more quickly and more broadly to odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The extensive axonal arbors of M/T cells can span distances of up to a centimeter (in the mouse) and innervate several areas collectively known as "olfactory cortex" [22], including the piriform cortex (PCTX), olfactory tubercle (OT), cortical amygdala (CoA), anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), tenia tecta and lateral entorhinal cortex.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Afferent Input</head><p><s>The dramatic crystalline array of glomeruli tiling the surface of the olfactory bulb (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) raises the possibility that sensory information is organized into discrete glomerular channels and further suggests that the glomerular array itself might be organized topographicallythe surface of an "unrolled" olfactory bulb might organize olfactory information (i.e.</s><s>inputs to single glomeruli) into a two-dimensional map that represents features of olfactory space.</s><s>The unusual anatomy of the olfactory bulb therefore potentially reconciles the idea that olfactory space is discrete (via molecular feature encoding within discrete glomeruli) with the notion that continuous sensory maps are often built in two-dimensional sheets, raising the possibility that the bulb contains a topographically-organized map for smell not so different from topographic maps for other sensory modalities.</s><s>Of course, maps are useful only insofar as they are read: thus more than 50 years before molecular biologists revealed the underlying functional organization of the bulb, researchers injected dyes, enzymes and radioactive tracers to ask whether there was a topographical relationship between spatial domains within the olfactory bulb and target regions in the olfactory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In principle the results from such experiments could fall anywhere between one of two extremes, from point-to-point topography (where nearby glomeruli project to nearby areas in olfactory cortex, reminiscent of retinal projections to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus), to all-to-all topography (where all glomeruli project to an equal extent to all regions of olfactory cortex, abandoning any spatial order apparent in the olfactory bulb).</s><s>These early labeling studies revealed a dense interconnectivity between the bulb and the olfactory cortex more suggestive of all-to-all than point-to-point topography, but with intriguing hints of underlying organization.</s><s>For example, the PCTX was shown to receive input from predominantly mitral cells, while the OT was shown to get most of its projections from tufted cells; clear gradients of axons were also revealed, with the anterior PCTX receiving more afferents than the posterior PCTX, and the lateral OT receiving denser innervation from the bulb than the medial OT <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</s><s>However, labeling of smaller bulb regions and filling of single mitral cells (which only partially highlighted their cortical extent) revealed patches of axonal branches that focally innervated multiple loci within the PCTX <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33]</ref>.</s><s>For many years this and other similar results served as a sort of Rorschach test, with some researchers arguing that these focal patches reveal all-to-all patterns of projection between the bulb and olfactory cortex, and others concluding that those same patches demonstrate underlying point-to-point topography.</s><s>Consistent with notions of a topographic mapping of the bulb onto the cortex, later experiments in which small amounts of dye were introduced into the bulb under the guidance of a fluorescence microscope revealed that projections to the AON pars externa are topographically organized (with a matched dorsal-to-ventral pattern of projections), raising the possibility that other regions of the olfactory cortex also receive spatially ordered patterns of projections from the bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The discovery that the spatial position of any given glomerulus (as defined by OR expression) is hardwired into the bulb and invariant from animal to animal revealed that odor identity can be encoded through spatial patterns of glomerular activity within the bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>.</s><s>While local circuits within the olfactory bulb likely modify these patterns via lateral interactions between glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the stereotyped nature of OSN axon projections into the bulb imposes a structured input to the population of M/T cells that is unique for any given olfactory stimulus.</s><s>The fundamental unit of computation within the olfactory bulb is therefore the glomerulus: glomeruli are genetically-specified channels that uniquely subsample olfactory space within a stereotyped bulbar map of odor identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, independent of any notion of topography, characterizing how information from a single glomerulus is distributed to the rest of the brain is crucial for understanding the function of the olfactory system.</s><s>Recent advances in multiphoton microscopy, genetics and viral tracing technologies have provided direct experimental access to this question, and in doing so shed new light on the question of topography in the olfactory cortex.</s><s>Electroporation of tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-dextran into single genetically identified glomeruli revealed that projections from the bulb, regardless of spatial location or identity, are dispersed across the entire surface of the PCTX <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).</s><s>This result was consistent with others obtained by introducing anterograde viral tracers into "sister" mitral cells that innervate the same glomerulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>.</s><s>In this case, each mitral cell was found to target a unique set of subdomains within the PCTX, with the summed axonal arbors of those sister mitral cells that innervate a given glomerulus effectively tiling the entire surface of the PCTX.</s><s>While these anterograde tracing experiments reveal that each glomerulus distributes its projections across the expanse of the PCTX, retrograde trans-synaptic viral tracing from single PCTX cells also demonstrates that single PCTX primary neurons receive inputs from glomeruli distributed across the bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, at least with respect to the PCTX, single glomerulus and single neuron tracing strongly suggests an all-to-all distribution of sensory information from the bulb to the cortex -every region of the bulb projects to every region of the PCTX.</s><s>It is important to note that the all-to-all nature of projections from the bulb to the PCTX breaks down a certain spatial scale because every glomerulus does not project to every neuron; rather it appears that PCTX neurons sample from local axons that contain information from spatially dispersed glomeruli within the bulb.</s><s>In contrast, anterograde tracing via dye electroporation revealed a starkly different pattern of projections from individual glomeruli to the CoA, in which individual genetically identified glomeruli were found to project to focal and spatially stereotyped regions of the CoA.</s><s>Axonal projections from the OB to the CoA and to the OT were also found to exhibit a crude set of topographical relationships: dorsal glomeruli tended to project to ventral regions of the CoA and OT, while ventral bulb regions projected to corresponding dorsal regions in the these areas ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, preliminary data).</s><s>This topography is not strict: individual glomeruli were identified that break this general rule, further supporting the notion that the relevant unit of computation in this system is the glomerulus itself.</s><s>Retrograde tracing also revealed features of topographic order in the olfactory system; primary neurons in the AON revealed topographically ordered patterns of projection from the bulb that preserve dorsal-ventral relationships (consistent with previous dye tracing results <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>), and infection of neurons within the CoA revealed a slightly higher overall density of innervation from the dorsal bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together these results suggest that at the anatomic level the genetically stereotyped glomerular map of odor identity within the olfactory bulb is dramatically rewritten through projections to the cortex: projections to the PCTX are dispersive and effectively destroy any notion of spatial order originating within the olfactory bulb, while in contrast the CoA receives topographically organized patterns of projection, suggesting that it may make use of information that is spatially organized across the olfactory bulb.</s><s>The OT seems to sit between these two extremes: although Sosulski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> did not analyze the pattern of projections from single glomeruli to the OT comprehensively, there seems to be little order to the bulbar projections other than the overall dorsal-ventral axis mapping mentioned above, and the preferential innervation of the "crest" regions of the OT (see below).</s><s>Taken together, these observations suggest that the OT receives a "hybrid" transformation of the glomerular map, although much work remains to be done to quantify afferent patterns of projection to the OT.</s></p></div>
