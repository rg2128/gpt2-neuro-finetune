<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>When presented with a set of stimuli, some people may attend to, and therefore learn most about concrete visual details, while others may attend to abstract semantic concepts associated with those stimuli.</s><s>Evidence suggests that such variations in attention and learning may reflect stable individual predispositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>We hypothesize that the expression of these predispositions is modulated by global variations in neural gain.</s><s>Specifically, we propose that high gain focuses attention and learning on dimensions of the environment to which one is predisposed to attend, whereas low gain broadens attention, thereby weakening the constraint of prior dispositions on attention and learning.</s></p><p><s>By what mechanism can gain exert these effects on attention?</s><s>Neural gain can be thought of as an amplifier of neural communication: when gain is increased, excited neurons become even more active and inhibited neurons become even less active <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Existing evidence suggests that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system serves to modulate neural gain throughout the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>We first use a simple neural network model in which different neural representations compete through mutual inhibition, to demonstrate that applying a high global level of gain to all network units can make strong neural representations even more dominant, while further weakening weaker competing representations.</s><s>Accordingly, we hypothesized that high gain results in processing that is more narrowly focused on the most strongly represented features of perceived information.</s></p><p><s>To test our hypotheses, we used a novel task that quantifies the degree of learning about perceptual versus semantic features of stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), together with a standard trait questionnaire that assesses predispositions to attend to and learn about perceptual versus semantic dimensions of stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>In general, we expected participants to exhibit better learning for the type of features (perceptual or semantic) to which they are predisposed.</s><s>More importantly, we hypothesized that this relationship would be modulated by neural gain.</s></p><p><s>While it is impossible to directly measure gain in human participants, pupil diameter, easily measurable noninvasively, has been suggested to track levels of neural gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Converging evidence suggests that baseline pupil diameter is correlated with tonic levels of LC-NE activity in rats, cats and monkeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , as well as with human behaviors predicted to be associated with tonic LC-NE activity in a variety of experimental tasks and manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>While baseline pupil diameter between individuals can be used to monitor changes in gain within individual, phasic pupil dilations normalized to baseline diameter are better suited for between-subject comparisons, as they are better dissociated from factors that can confound between-subject baseline measures.</s><s>Because phasic responses are inversely related to baseline pupil diameter and tonic LC-NE activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , pupil dilation responses provide an inverse measure of tonic gain.</s></p><p><s>To test neural predictions of our gain-modulation hypothesis concerning the relationship between pupil diameter and the match between individual predispositions and learning performance, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</s><s>First, increased gain implies that neural signals are enhanced, which in turn predicts that interactions between connected parts of the network should increase.</s><s>Indeed, gain modulation has been proposed as a mechanism for flexible control of network functional connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>This suggests that global fluctuations in neural gain should be associated with global fluctuations in the strength of functional connectivity, and furthermore, that these fluctuations in functional connectivity should correlate with changes in pupil diameter.</s><s>To test these predictions, we measured the degree to which fluctuations in functional connectivity within brain areas were correlated between areas, as well as with changes in pupil diameter.</s></p><p><s>Second, our neural network modeling of the effect of gain on learning suggested that the link between gain and focused learning should be mediated by a more tightly-clustered pattern of neural interactions through which processing is selectively focused on particular input streams.</s><s>In contrast, when gain in the model was low, widely-distributed interactions mediated the concurrent processing of multiple stimulus features.</s><s>Accordingly, we predicted that within-participant baseline pupil diameter would correlate throughout the experiment with the degree to which functional connectivity is clustered, as measured using graphtheoretic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , and that the degree of clustering would, in turn, correlate with a bias in learning performance toward the type of features that individual participants are predisposed to process.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A model of neural gain and predispositions in learning</head><p><s>First, to formalize our hypothesis about the effect of gain on attention and learning, we constructed a simple neural network model of the task, that learned a stimulus-reward relationship from examples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>The input to the network consisted of two separate streams of information, each representing one dimension (e.g.</s><s>visual or semantic).</s><s>One feature in each dimension was associated with a monetary reward while the other was not.</s><s>We simulated a predisposition to attend to one dimension more than to the other by making connection weights in one stream stronger than those in the other stream.</s><s>We then examined the degree to which the network learned to associate the reward-predicting feature in each stream with a reward output, as a function of both the predisposition of the network and the level of gain.</s></p><p><s>With low gain, inputs from both the strong and weak streams propagated to the subsequent layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), and the relationship with reward was learned for both types of features (that is, predisposition did not significantly bias learning; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">black</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, when gain was high, inputs in the strong stream dominated representations in the middle layer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) and learning of the input-reward relationship tended to proceed only on strongly-represented features (i.e., learning was biased towards features that the network was predisposed to represent; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">gray</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the simulations demonstrate that increased gain can focus learning on those features that the network is predisposed to represent.</s><s>The simulations also demonstrate that gain affects communication patterns in the network: with lower gain multiple input streams interact (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>); but with higher gain weak input streams have less of an effect on other parts of the network, with the result that network connectivity is more tightly clustered and separate subnetworks are formed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupil responses and adherence to predispositions</head><p><s>To test for the predicted relationship between pupil responses (as an index of neural gain) and the influence of attentional predispositions on learning, we asked participants to choose between pairs of multidimensional images (comprised of visual and semantic features) and rewarded them according to their choices.</s><s>Unbeknownst to the participants, within each stimulus set one visual feature and one semantic feature predicted monetary reward (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>For example, in one stimulus set, office-related images but not food-related images (semantic features) yielded reward and, similarly, grayscale images but not color images (visual features) yielded reward (rewards were additive so that a grayscale office-related image yielded twice the reward).</s><s>Throughout 18 games, each with different semantic and visual dimensions and unique stimuli, we measured participants' visual and semantic performance separately using trials in which stimuli differed on either the visual or the semantic features, but not both.</s></p><p><s>In addition, we assessed each participant's predisposition to process either the visual or semantic features using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>The ILS questionnaire contrasts a 'sensing' learning style that indicates a predisposition to process and learn about sense-related data such as visual features, with an 'intuitive' learning style that indicates a predisposition to learn about abstract concepts such as semantic categories.</s></p><p><s>The results showed that a more intuitive (and less sensing) learning style was correlated with better performance on the semantic trials compared to the visual trials (r = 0.28, p = 0.05 one tailed; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>; see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for overall performance levels), consistent with a predisposition to attend to and learn about semantic vs. visual features of the stimuli.</s><s>Critically, the degree to which task performance matched individual predisposition was strongly anti correlated with mean pupil dilation response across individuals (r = -0.96,</s><s>p &lt; 0.01; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Given the inverse relationship between pupil response and gain discussed above, our finding suggests that the association between task performance and individual predisposition was itself associated with high gain.</s><s>These behavioral results were fully replicated in a second experiment in which a different group of participants performed the same task while being scanned using fMRI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, in both experiments mean pupil dilation response did not correlate with overall task performance (behavioral experiment: n = 35, r = -0.13,</s><s>p = 0.44; imaging experiment: n = 30, r = 0.04, p = 0.82), mean reaction times (following log transform; behavioral experiment: n = 35, r = 0.17, p = 0.33; imaging experiment: n = 30, r = 0.06, p = 0.77), or with answers to debriefing questions regarding interest, motivation and attention (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that the relationship between pupil responses and adherence to one's learning predisposition cannot be explained in terms of fluctuations in overall level of arousal or attention to the task.</s><s>Further analysis confirmed that the decrease in correlation between ILS score and task performance for participants withhigher pupil response (lower gain) was not simply a result of a more limited range of ILS scores for these participants (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupil diameter and fMRI indicators of gain</head><p><s>We next examined the fMRI data for evidence of fluctuations in gain within individual participants, and tested whether these correlate with pupillary indices of gain.</s><s>Increased gain entails that neural activation is driven toward maximal or minimal levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Thus, large baseline pupil diameter should be associated with more extreme fMRI activations.</s><s>Indeed, we found that the fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was farther from the mean when baseline pupil diameter was large (mean absolute deviation from the mean 8.36) compared to when it was small (mean absolute deviation 8.02; t 29 = 3.79, p &lt; 1D, paired t-test comparing 10% of trials with highest pupil diameter to 10% of trials with lowest pupil diameter).</s></p><p><s>An additional prediction that stems from the assumed relationship between pupil diameter and gain is that the magnitude of pupil dilation in response to task-relevant stimuli should correlate with the magnitude of the BOLD response to task-relevant stimuli, but not to taskirrelevant stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>To test this prediction, we had included in the experiment random, taskirrelevant, auditory stimuli that participants were instructed to ignore.</s><s>As predicted, both low baseline pupil diameter and high pupil dilation response were associated with stronger BOLD responses to task-relevant stimuli, but not to task-irrelevant stimuli (baseline diameter: t 27 = -5.04,</s><s>p &lt; 10 -5 ; dilation response: t 27 = 2.56, p &lt; 0.05; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupil diameter and global fluctuations in functional connectivity</head><p><s>The neural network learning model described above suggests that global changes in gain should be associated with global changes in the strength of functional connections.</s><s>To examine this suggestion in a more general setting, we simulated the effects of gain on functional connectivity (unit-to-unit correlations) in large (1000 units) randomly-constructed networks that were not designed to perform any particular task.</s><s>This simulation as well suggested that high gain should be associated with stronger mean functional connectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a-c</ref>; r = 0.99, p &lt; 10 -13 ).</s></p><p><s>Thus, we first examined whether the fMRI data is characterized by global fluctuations in the strength of functional connections.</s><s>Towards this end, we measured functional connectivity while participants performed the learning task and assessed the extent to which fluctuations in functional connectivity in different brain areas were correlated with each other.</s><s>To do this, we divided each participant's brain arbitrarily into 32 boxes, which contained roughly similar volumes of gray matter (27.1 ± 2.6 cm 3 ; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>We then measured the mean strength of functional connectivity within each box during each game (quantified as the mean absolute correlation of the time series of the fMRI signal among pairs of voxels within the box).</s><s>Finally, we correlated the time series of mean functional connectivity values over games for each pair of boxes.</s><s>Mean functional connectivity strength across games was positively correlated for 96% of all box pairs, and the mean correlation coefficient was 0.72 (range 0.27 to 0.95 across participants, t 29 = 10.85,</s><s>p &lt; 10 -10 ; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>Notably, this correlation did not simply reflect a common global signal component, since the mean graymatter signal was regressed out of the data prior to the functional connectivity analysis.</s><s>Thus, even though our measurements of functional connectivity in different boxes involved strictly disjoint brain areas, we found very strong correlationsin fluctuations of these measurements throughout the brain.</s></p><p><s>While this result is strongly suggestive of global modulation of neural signaling, it is nevertheless possible that global fluctuations in local functional connectivity reflect correlated local instabilities of the MRI scanner.</s><s>Such a confound could be dismissed if the measured fluctuations in functional connectivity were also to covary with the separately attained measures of baseline pupil diameter.</s><s>Indeed, we found that when baseline pupil diameter was highest (indicative of high gain), high functional connectivity measurements were more prevalent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>, gray, whereas when baseline pupil diameter was lowest (low gain) weaker functional connectivity was more prevalent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">black</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, baseline pupil diameter was positively correlated with mean functional connectivity strength (mean r = 0.27 across participants, t 27 = 2.98, p &lt; 0.01), and, similarly, pupil responses were anticorrelated with mean functional connectivity strength (mean r = -0.24</s><s>across participants, t 27 = -3.63,</s><s>p &lt; 0.01).</s><s>In particular, baseline diameter was positively correlated with the number of functional connectivity measurements stronger than ± 0.17, and anticorrelated with the number of weaker functional connectivity measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Remarkably, this non-monotonic relationship between functional connectivity strength and its correlations with baseline diameter was predicted by our simulation of the effects of gain on functional connectivity in randomly connected neural networks (cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To verify that the relationship between functional connectivity and pupil diameter was not specific to particular brain regions, but rather was manifest throughout the brain, we examined this relationship separately in each of the 32 boxes.</s><s>Functional connectivity strength was positively correlated with baseline pupil diameter in 70% of the boxes (22 out of 32 boxes per participant on average; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>), and the mean correlation coefficient was 0.19 (t 27 = 3.19, p &lt; 0.01; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>).</s><s>Notably, baseline pupil diameter was not correlated with the mean box fMRI signal (mean r = -0.004,</s><s>t 27 = -0.35,</s><s>p = 0.73), indicating that the relationship with functional connectivity strength did not reflect pupil-related variations in signal strength.</s><s>Further, the relationship between baseline diameter and functional connectivity strength was fairly consistent throughout the brain: for every box, functional connectivity was positively correlated with baseline pupil diameter in at least half of the participants.</s><s>As expected, functional connectivity strength was also anticorrelated with pupil dilation response in 75% of the boxes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c</ref>), and the mean correlation coefficient was -0.20 (t 27 = -3.54,</s><s>p &lt; 0.01; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7d</ref>).</s><s>Our results thus suggest that the strength of functional connectivity fluctuated in a similar manner throughout the brain, and these fluctuations were tracked closely by both pupil diameter indices.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupil diameter, neural clustering and task performance</head><p><s>The results of our learning neural network model also suggested that with high gain functional connectivity should be more tightly clustered rather than evenly distributed.</s><s>To examine this in a more general setting, we constructed a functional connectivity graph for each of the random 1000-unit networks described above.</s><s>Each of the graphs' nodes represented a unit and two units were connected by an edge if the correlation of activity between them was in the top 1% of all such correlations.</s><s>The clustering coefficient 1 of such a graph indicates the degree to which functional connectivity is tightly clustered in the network.</s><s>As expected, higher gain was associated with higher clustering coefficients (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>; r = 0.99, p &lt; 10 -12 ).</s></p><p><s>To test the degree to which functional connectivity was tightly clustered in the brain, we then constructed a functional connectivity graph for each participant and each game (18 graphs per participant).</s><s>The graphs were constructed as done for the simulated networks, except that in this case each of the graphs' nodes represented a voxel (see Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> for example graphs).</s><s>As predicted, we found a significant game-by-game correlation between the clustering coefficient of these graphs and baseline pupil diameter (mean r = 0.14 across participants, t 27 = 1.82, p &lt; 0.05 one tailed; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8a</ref>).</s><s>That is, when participants' pupil diameter indicated high gain, their neural functional connectivity tended to be more tightly clustered.</s><s>Moreover, we found a similar correlation when the analysis was restricted to prefrontal cortex, an area that is not involved in primary visual processing (mean r = 0.14 across participants, t 27 = 2.05, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the relationship between pupil diameter and clustering was indeed due to global fluctuations in gain and not differences in activation to the visual stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Finally, to the extent that functional connectivity clustering reflects the effects of gain on attention, we expected the degree of clustering to be associated with the degree to which learning was focused on stimulus features to which the individual was predisposed to attend.</s><s>Consistent with this prediction, we found a significant game-by-game correlation between the clustering coefficient and a shift in learning performance toward the type of feature that the ILS scores indicated as preferred by each participant (mean r = 0.08 across participants, t 29 = 2.2, p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>Concordantly, ILS score was correlated with the relationship between clustering coefficient and task performance (r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.05; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, when participants' neural functional connections were more tightly clustered, task performance more strongly reflected individual predispositions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We investigated the relationship between global, brain-wide fluctuations in neural gain and the effect of individual priors or attentional predispositions (so-called 'learning styles') on trial-and-error learning behavior.</s><s>More specifically, we used pupil-diameter measures as a proxy for global levels of neural gain, to test the hypothesis that predispositions constrain learning more strongly when gain is higher.</s><s>In two experiments, the degree to which learning performance followed individual predisposition was strongly correlated with pupil response.</s><s>We then provided more direct neural evidence in support of our interpretation of this correlation.</s><s>First, we showed that brain function is characterized by global fluctuations in the strength of functional connectivity, as would be expected from global modulation of gain, and that these fluctuations are tracked by pupillary indices of gain.</s><s>Second, we showed that these pupillary indices are correlated with the degree to which functional connectivity is clustered, as was predicted by our neural network modeling.</s><s>Finally, we showed that increases in such clustering are associated with a shift in the content of learning towards the type of information that individual participants are predisposed to process.</s><s>Taken together, these results provide strong converging evidence in favor of the hypothesis that high gain constrains the type of information that is learned from multidimensional sensory input in accordance with one's prior processing dispositions.</s></p><p><s>The finding that local fluctuations in functional connectivity are globally correlated across the brain, and that these fluctuations are correlated with pupillary indices supports existing theory that implicates the LC-NE system in global modulation of neural gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>We note however that the relationship between gain and functional connectivity may not be as simple as we portray here, due to factors such as saturation of neural activity, network dynamics and spiking dynamics.</s><s>Nevertheless, the results of our study, understood in the context of existing evidence and theory, conform to the expectation that gain and functional connectivity should covary.</s><s>In addition, our clustering analysis findings extend this theory by suggesting that high gain is associated with a shift from a widely distributed pattern of neural processing to a more tightly-clustered pattern dominated by the strongest input streams.</s></p><p><s>The results of our study provide a neural-computational framework within which past findings concerning the relationship of stress and norepinephrine levels to cognitive function can be understood.</s><s>A large body of psychological research in humans suggests that stress (which is associated with high levels of norepinephrine) reduces the breadth of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Another line of studies shows that stress and norepinephrine shift rat and human behavior from a flexible mode of behavior to a more rigid habitual mode in which previously established stimulus-response associations are followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>Stress and norepinephrine have also been linked to diminished performance in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Our findings suggest an explanation of these previously observed phenomena in terms of the influence of the LC-NE system in globally modulating neural gain.</s><s>Increased gain narrows attention by strengthening already strong neural representations at the expense of competing weaker representations.</s><s>This, in turn, favors previously established patterns of behavior, which are subserved by well-established neural circuits and thus tend to form stronger representations.</s></p><p><s>We attempted to identify the effects of neural gain -a computational concept defined in terms of the input-output function of neural units -on behavior and on whole-brain fMRI metrics.</s><s>This constitutes a novel, promising approach by which low-level principles of neural function may be linked via computational modeling to system-level neural and behavioral phenomena.</s><s>However, the disadvantage of our approach is that it necessarily relies on a broad set of assumptions.</s><s>Specifically, in making our predictions we assumed that changes in pupil diameter would track changes in neural gain.</s><s>Furthermore, our fMRI predictions were based on the assumption that the BOLD signal would reflect the neural effects of gain simulated by changes in firing rates in our computational models.</s><s>This last assumption is particularly tenuous, since several studies have found dissociations between spiking activity and the BOLD signal specifically under conditions that are thought to involve changes in neuromodulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, we presented here a diverse set of behavioral and imaging results that precisely match the predictions made by our neural network simulations of the effect of gain on neural activity, connectivity and behavior.</s><s>This set of converging results, in addition to evidence from past studies, provides substantial support for the assumptions underlying this study.</s></p><p><s>The focusing effect of neural gain on processing may at first glance seem to be in conflict with previous accounts suggesting that tonically high gain reduces task-focused attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>However, while our findings suggest that increased gain focuses attention on predisposed dimensions of sensory stimuli, these need not be related to the task at hand.</s><s>Rather, if distracting stimuli are salient enough to evoke strong neural representations, our theory predicts that high gain would be associated with increased attention to distracters, and thus, with reduced task-focused attention.</s><s>Our findings also fit well with a previous suggestion 1 that phasic norepinephrine responses, which are stronger in low gain states (low tonic LC-NE activity), facilitate behavioral flexibility in response to unexpected target stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Several of our results drew upon graph-theoretic methods, that have increasingly been used to analyze both structural and functional brain imaging data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>The strength of these methods lies in their ability to capture, by simple quantitative measures, characteristics of networks that are comprised of a very large number of elements.</s><s>Most previous studies employing graph-theoretic analyses have investigated stationary aspects of neural processing networks, but a few recent studies have begun to examine how measures of functional brain network topology vary with behavior 1, 2, 3.</s><s>The latter, however, analyzed relatively small networks (&lt; 120 nodes).</s><s>In contrast, we used graph-theoretic measures to examine how the topology of high-resolution whole-brain networks (&gt; 20000 nodes) varies with behavior.</s><s>Our results indicate that such an analysis can provide meaningful insights into the way sensory information is processed and learned.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our findings suggest that processing predispositions can influence learning, but that these priors are not always binding.</s><s>Rather, brain-wide fluctuations in neural gain induce different modes of neural communication, that modulate the breadth of attention, and thus the extent to which processing and learning are constrained by prior dispositions.</s><s>The adaptive value of modulating this aspect of processing in accord with situational variables is clear.</s><s>The question now is what drives these changes in gain, and how does the brain determine what mode of processing is suitable at any given moment.</s></p></div>
