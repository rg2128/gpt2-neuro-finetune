type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The identification of the volatiles present in the headspace of natural human skin bacterial cultures led to the development of a synthetic blend consisting of ten compounds that was attractive to A. gambiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Volatiles produced by bacteria are often widespread among bacterial taxa, but some transformations of organic compounds lead to the production of volatiles that are species-specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Bacillus subtilis has been associated with foot

extremely versatile organisms, which are primarily found in soil, water, decomposing organic materials, and also found in the intestinal flora.</s><s>They are not commonly associated with human skin <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the best known Pseudomonas species on the human skin, often found as a secondary

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Four of the five bacterial species grown in vitro in liquid medium, produced volatiles that were attractive to the malaria mosquito A. gambiae at the concentrations tested (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The ranking of these four bacterial species shows that some species commonly found on the human skin produce volatile blends that are more attractive to A. gambiae than volatile blends of other bacterial species.</s><s>This shows that not all micro-organisms present on the human skin contribute equally to the attractiveness conferred to mosquitoes.</s><s>Corynebacterium minutissimum ranked significantly higher than B. subtilis and S. epidermidis in the second series of experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Volatiles of P. aeruginosa were not attractive, and may even attenuate the effect of the volatiles from the other bacterial species.</s></p><p><s>The difference between the response of A. gambiae to volatiles released by skin bacteria in their exponential growth phase and stationary phase could in part be explained by the higher number of bacteria in the stationary phase.</s><s>However, the headspace analyses show clearly that some compounds were present in the headspace samples of the bacterial broths in the stationary phase, but were not detected in samples of the bacterial broths in the exponential growth phase (Table <ref type="table">S2A</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>This indicates qualitative differences in volatile production between the two growth phases.</s></p><p><s>The outermost layer of the human skin, the stratum corneum, is predominantly an oxic environment.</s><s>However, certain microenvironments of the skin, such as glands and hair follicles, contain reduced levels of oxygen or no oxygen at all.</s><s>Under these microaerophilic or anoxic conditions only bacteria with fermentative metabolic characteristics will be active <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>During fermentation processes, organic compounds are converted into many different smaller compounds, often of a volatile nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Staphylococcus epidermidis, for example, metabolizes glycerol and lactic acid, forming large amounts of acetic and propionic acid as fermentation products <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Fermentation reactions, which occurred during the stationary phase of our experiments, could explain the high diversity of compounds found in the headspace of broths at this stage.</s><s>Four of our bacterial species are known to express fermentation reactions in the absence of oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, P. aeruginosa grows best in the presence of oxygen or nitrate and has only limited fermentative capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>To test whether fermentation in the absence of oxygen plays a role in the production of volatiles attractive to A. gambiae, the bacterial strains should be grown under anoxic conditions and tested for attractiveness to A. gambiae.</s></p><p><s>All five bacterial species could be grown in the same liquid medium and although this is probably not the most suitable medium for all species tested, it allowed for a comparison of the volatile blends produced against the same background.</s><s>Trapping the volatiles from the headspace samples of bacteria using the CLSA technique resulted in more than 150 volatiles of which 11 were considered for further testing for their effect on A. gambiae's host-seeking behaviour (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>Dimethyltetrasulfide, pentathiane, dimethylpentasulfide, hexathiepane and octasulfur were not commercially available.</s><s>It is of interest to synthesize these compounds and test them for their attractiveness to A. gambiae.</s><s>All of the remaining six compounds induced a behavioural response of A. gambiae in the olfactometer when tested in combination with the basic blend that consisted of ammonia, lactic acid and tetradecanoic acid (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Blends consisting of these nine compounds in varying ratios could further increase the mosquito catch and should be studied in future experiments under African semi-field or field conditions to reveal their potential use in mosquito control programmes.</s><s>The chemically-driven analysis described in this study tends to reveal only highly abundant compounds, which are not necessarily the most behaviorally important ones.</s><s>Bioassay-guided approaches that use a combination of gas chromatography and electrophysiological recording from olfactory organs (electroantennograpy) or single olfactory sensilla could reveal additional compounds occurring at low abundance that are therefore not detected by coupled gas chromatography -mass spectrometry, yet might exert behavioural activity.</s><s>Ultimately, however, behavioural assays as applied in the current study are required to validate such activity.</s><s>In addition, we note that the selection of compounds was not based on abundance as such but on the difference in abundance between exponential and stationary growth phases of the bacterial cultures and the absence of attraction by one of the bacterial species.</s></p><p><s>Based on the headspace composition it was not expected that butyl butyrate would increase the attractiveness of the basic blend to A. gambiae, since this compound was present in higher quantities in the headspace of P. aeruginosa broths than in that of broths containing B. subtilis, Brev.</s><s>epidermidis or C. minutissimum.</s><s>An explanation may be that the concentration of butyl butyrate tested in the olfactometer was different from the concentration released by P. aeruginosa broths, or other compounds present in the headspace samples of P. aeruginosa broths may have influenced the behavioural response of A. gambiae.</s></p><p><s>Dimethyldisulfide is the most interesting compound to test in semi-field and field experiments to evaluate as a mosquito bait under natural African conditions, because it was the only compound that increased the number of A. gambiae caught when added to the basic blend at the lowest concentration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>Dimethyldisulfide is a known bacterial volatile <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, also found in human skin emanations
