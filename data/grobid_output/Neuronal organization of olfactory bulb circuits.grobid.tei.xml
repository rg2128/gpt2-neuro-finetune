olfactory bulb.</s></p><p><s>Histologically, the olfactory bulb is divided into multiple layers.</s><s>Intensive Golgi analyses in the 1970s succeeded in visualizing the morphology of neurons in each

addition, some olfactory bulb neurons have not been typically included in conventional categories due to their relatively small numbers [e.g., short-axon cells in the External plexiform layer (EPL)

novel findings are scattered across many literary references, and recent reviews have not effectively summarized the neuronal diversity in the olfactory bulb.</s><s>Here, we gather the scattered results and summarize the discoveries regarding the new neuronal types and connections in each layer.</s><s>Since understanding the inputs and outputs of neurons is fundamental to building a network model, we focus mainly on somata locations, axon/dendrite extension patterns, neurotransmitters, and/or the physiological properties of neurons.</s><s>We believe that this review greatly adds to our

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY THE OLFACTORY BULB CIRCUIT AS BASED ON RECENTLY IDENTIFIED NEURONAL GROUPS</head><p><s>This review summarizes the properties of numerous neurons in the olfactory bulb by focusing on their morphology, protein expression, and function.</s><s>As the motivation behind this work is to have a more advanced model of olfactory bulb circuit, we assembled the recognized neuronal connections into a diagram (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>We included the connections suggested from the dendritic arborization, axonal projection pattern and physiological data in addition to the established connections.</s><s>Although the diagram is still far from complete, it would be helpful for neuronal researches in the olfactory bulb circuits.</s><s>In addition, we discuss some of the issues not highlighted above to bridge the recent research results and the conventional diagram of the circuit.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>External tufted cells and superficial tufted cells</head><p><s>In the course of defining the neuronal groups, the categorization of ET cells and superficial tufted cells creates some confusion.</s><s>More specifically, there seems to be little consensus regarding the exact definition of a superficial tufted cell.</s><s>In literature, the term superficial tufted cell could be just a synonym of ET cell, or it could represent a tufted cell whose cell body is located in the superficial part of the EPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kosaka et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Luo and Katz, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hamilton et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>As discussed in the GL section, ET cells consist of two subtypes that are morphologically and physiologically distinct.</s><s>In some reports, the superficial tufted cell is described as the subtype with secondary dendrites and therefore the term ET cell only represents the subtype without secondary dendrites <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ezeh et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kiyokage et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In our opinion, this seems the most sensible use of the terms.</s></p><p><s>A fraction of putative middle tufted cells located in the superficial EPL potentially belongs to the superficial tufted cells as well.</s><s>Both of two ET cell/superficial tufted cell subpopulations that release peptide hormones CCK and vasopressin, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Liu and Shipley, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Tobin et al., 2010)</ref>, have secondary dendrites and are thus most likely involved in the superficial tufted cells, implying the further functional heterogeneity of superficial tufted cells.</s><s>Additional investigations are required to definitively conclude how superficial tufted cells differ from ET cells (i.e., without secondary dendrites) or from middle tufted cells.</s><s>For example, it is an interesting question whether the targets of their axon and/or axon collaterals are the same, partially overlapping, or mutually exclusive.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tufted cells and mitral cells</head><p><s>Here, we regard mitral and tufted cells as different cell types due to their divergent properties, including the location of the cell body, patterns of secondary dendrite extension and axonal projection, firing frequency, odor sensitivity, tuning specificity, and odor response phase on the respiratory rhythm.</s><s>However, as stated above, recent investigations have identified certain projection neurons that have features of both tufted and mitral cells, such as mitral cells that extend secondary dendrites into the superficial EPL.</s><s>These reports raise the question of whether mitral and tufted cells actually compose segregated circuits, and whether they are clearly distinguishable cell types or not.</s></p><p><s>A provocative idea is that mitral and tufted cells are on a continuum of neurons physically aligned from the superficial to deep portions of the EPL-MCL area, where the continuum comprises ET, superficial tufted, middle tufted, internal tufted, type-II mitral, and type-I mitral cells.</s><s>The alignment may be also associated with the birth date of the neurons during the embryonic stage.</s><s>A key point to examine within this hypothesis is the existence of any molecule(s) with a differential expression pattern between mitral and tufted cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Granule cells</head><p><s>This review describes morphologically distinct granule cells in the rodent olfactory bulb, particularly in regard to dendritic extension patterns in the EPL.</s><s>In fact, at least three subgroups of granule cells have been identified according to dendritic morphology: type-I, II, and III granule cells.</s><s>However, these three subtypes do not cover the entire granule cell population, because some granule cells have morphologies that do not resemble any of these types.</s><s>One example is the type-S cell.</s><s>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Merkle et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short-axon cells</head><p><s>One might consider that interneurons in the olfactory bulb other than PG cells and granule cells are the same type of neuron, since they are all called short-axon cells.</s><s>Nonetheless, shortaxon cells are a diverse population with varied morphologies and functions, and, thus, they should not be regarded as a single group.</s><s>In addition, as discussed in the EPL section, some EPL interneurons, which were conventionally categorized as shortaxon cells, may not have an actual axon, but instead have only an axon-like process <ref type="bibr">(Kosaka and Kosaka, 2008a)</ref>.</s><s>These various short-axon cells deserve re-investigation with the aid of contemporary technology, similar to the recent re-investigations of dSA cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Eyre et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Eyre et al., , 2009))</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Horizontal interactions in the olfactory bulb</head><p><s>The remarkable change from the conventional to updated olfactory bulb circuit diagram is that various types of cells can contribute to horizontal interactions in the GL and EPL.</s><s>Conventionally, horizontal interactions were thought to be mediated mainly by dendrodendritic reciprocal synapses formed between mitral/tufted cells and granule cells.</s><s>However, recent work revealed that sSA cells in the GL and PV-positive neurons in the EPL also contribute to horizontal interactions in each layer.</s><s>Interestingly, the locations of the interaction sites are clearly segregated.</s><s>The sSA cells mediate horizontal interactions only in the GL, while PVpositive cells mediate such interactions only in the EPL.</s><s>Moreover, these cells differ in morphology.</s><s>While the sSA cell has an axon, most PV-positive cells are axonless and send outputs from dendrites alone, similar to granule cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Huang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kato et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Miyamichi et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The locational and morphological variances probably reflect the functional distinctions between these neurons.</s><s>Further clarification of such functional distinctions is essential for understanding how convergent odor information is processed through the interaction of multiple glomerular modules.</s></p></div>
