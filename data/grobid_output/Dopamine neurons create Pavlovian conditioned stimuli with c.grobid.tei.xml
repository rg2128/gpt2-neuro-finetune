<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dopamine neurons imbue environmental cues with conditioned stimulus properties</head><p><s>For selective manipulation of dopamine neurons, we expressed ChR2 in the ventral midbrain in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-cre rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , which allowed for optogenetic targeting of TH+/ dopamine neurons with ~97% specificity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>To compare the contribution of different dopamine neuronal subpopulations, optical fibers were implanted over ChR2-expressing dopamine neurons in either the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, f; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>To test the contribution of phasic dopamine neuron activity in the creation of conditioned stimuli, rats underwent optogenetic Pavlovian cue conditioning (Fig 1b).</s><s>Rats in the paired groups received 25 overlapping cue (light+tone, 7-sec) and laser (473-nm; 5-sec at 20 Hz, delivered 2-sec after cue onset) presentations per session.</s><s>The cue light was positioned on one wall of the chamber, within rearing height for an adult rat.</s><s>To control for non-associative effects of repeated cues and optogenetic stimulation, separate rats were exposed to cue and laser presentations that never overlapped (unpaired groups).</s><s>VTA and SNc cre+ paired groups both quickly learned conditioned responses (CRs), defined here simply as locomotion, during the 7-sec cue presentations, and these CRs emerged progressively earlier in the cue period across training for both groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1k</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Cre+ unpaired and cre-controls did not learn CRs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The latency of CR onset in paired groups decreased across training, and, late in training, most CRs were initiated during the first 2-sec of each cue period, before laser onset, for both VTA and SNc cre+ paired groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i-k</ref>).</s><s>This indicates that behavior in paired subjects was a conditioned effect, elicited by cue presentations, rather than directly by laser stimulation.</s><s>Further supporting this, optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons in cre+ unpaired groups failed to generate behavior statistically different from cre-controls, during either the cue or laser periods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>These results show that, at least for the stimulation parameters used here, unsignalled phasic midbrain dopamine neuron activity in the VTA or SNc does not reliably act as an unconditioned or conditioned stimulus that can elicit behaviors.</s><s>We conducted an additional experiment where rats received cue-laser paired conditioning similar to that described above, but optogenetic stimulation was limited to 1 sec per trial (20  5-ms pulses at 20 Hz, delivered in the final 1 sec of cue presentations).</s><s>Here too, cue-evoked locomotion emerged, with the same probability as seen in the 5-sec laser conditioning groups (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Together, our results suggest that the contiguous or contemporaneous occurrence of salient sensory cues at the time dopamine neurons are active serves as a critical gate on the ability of dopamine neurons to promote behavior.</s><s>This provides important context to recent studies on the contribution of dopamine neurons to explicit unconditioned movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and, broadly, associative learning.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cue-evoked dopamine neuron activity reflects expectation of dopamine neuron activity</head><p><s>On the first and last day of optogenetic conditioning, we included probe trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, 25% of the total) in which cues were delivered but laser was omitted.</s><s>On these trials, dopamine neuron activity in paired rats decreased at the time laser would have been delivered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>This omission-related decrease in fluorescence developed across conditioning, and was not seen in unpaired controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b-e</ref>).</s><s>These results parallel electrophysiological recordings of dopamine neurons demonstrating a pause in their firing during the omission of expected food or water <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , which is thought to be mediated by recruitment of local GABAergic neuron activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Our data suggest that natural reward exposure is not necessary to engage such midbrain plasticity mechanisms in Pavlovian learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We next conducted an extinction session, during which these rats received 25 cue presentations, but no laser stimulation was delivered (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</s><s>This resulted in rapid reduction, to levels observed in session one, of the cue-evoked fluorescence spike (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>) as well as the omission-related dip in fluorescence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3i</ref>).</s><s>Extinction of the neural signal tracked behavioral extinction, such that after one extinction session, behavior evoked by the cue diminished to a level comparable to the first training session (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref>).</s><s>Thus, rapid adjustments in the population-level activity of dopamine neurons track extinction of stimulation-evoked learning.</s><s>Together, the above findings demonstrate neural encoding of the predictive relationship between these cues and direct dopamine neuron activation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VTA and SNc dopamine neurons confer distinct motivational properties to cues</head><p><s>Reward-associated CSs direct actions not only by serving as reward predictors that come to evoke neural activity, but also by acquiring reward-like incentive value.</s><s>'Incentive value' here is defined as that property of cues that lends them motivational power to attract attention and become desirable in the absence of reward, an important process that may contribute to compulsive seeking in addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>The acquisition of incentive value does not necessarily accompany the acquisition of predictive value <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , and so we next asked if VTA and SNc dopamine-associated CSs acquired incentive value.</s><s>To do this, we examined the detailed structure of behavior during Pavlovian conditioning in ChR2-conditioned groups.</s><s>In response to cue presentations, cre+ paired VTA rats (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>) showed cue-directed approach behavior, moving to come into proximity (&lt; 1 in) with the cue light while it was illuminated (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>; Video 1).</s><s>This "attraction" conditioned response is a standard behavioral index of the attribution of incentive motivational value to a CS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Critically, cre+ paired SNc rats did not develop approach behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d-f</ref>).</s><s>VTA approach probability did not relate to subjects' proximity to the cue before cue onset (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), and was not observed in unpaired or cre-controls (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>; Supplementary Videos 2-5).</s><s>These results suggest that VTA, but not SNc, dopamine neurons confer incentive value to CSs, and this process does not require typical rewardelicited neuronal processes other than dopamine neuron activation.</s></p><p><s>While SNc dopamine paired rats did not develop approach behavior, we observed vigorous locomotion in these rats during cue presentations, but which was not directed at the cue.</s><s>To quantify this conditioned movement, and compare it to the other groups, we analyzed behavioral videos using motion tracking to interpolate rats' positions in the experimental chamber in the periods before, during, and after cue presentations on the final day of conditioning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>We used this position information to determine the frame-by frame velocity and the distance of the rats' heads from the cue.</s><s>This tracking revealed that, at cue onset, cre+ paired SNc rats initiated rapid movement, reaching peak velocity within ~1 sec (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>The timing of movement onset and mean velocity in the first 2-sec of the cue was significantly greater for SNc rats than for cre+ VTA paired rats.</s><s>In this analysis, unpaired and cre-controls did not show cue or laser evoked movement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a-d</ref>), consistent with our earlier results.</s><s>During the last 5-sec of cue presentations, corresponding to the laser stimulation period, SNc and VTA paired rats exhibited stable and similar movement speeds, and velocity quickly returned to low levels after cue offset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a-d</ref>).</s><s>Together with our photometry data, the movement analysis suggests that Pavlovian conditioned dopamine neuron signals, in addition to spontaneous dopamine neuron signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , are involved in the generation of vigorous movements, and more so for SNc, compared to VTA, dopamine neurons.</s></p><p><s>During extended conditioned movements, rats turned in circles within the chamber, directed contralateral to the simulation hemisphere.</s><s>We quantified this movement as "rotations" and compared their occurrence to cue-directed movement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e</ref>, Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</s><s>In agreement with the experimenter-scored behavior data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), motion tracking analysis revealed a cue-directed movement bias for VTA paired rats, who, on average, came closer to the cue during its presentation, compared to SNc rats and controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5f</ref>, Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</s><s>SNc paired rats, in contrast, showed a bias towards rotational movement, reaching a faster angular velocity, relative to VTA rats (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5g</ref>).</s><s>While SNc rats showed an exclusive rotational movement phenotype throughout training (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5h</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure">j</ref>), VTA paired rats also developed rotational movement as training progressed, resulting in a mixed cue-directed vs. rotational movement behavioral phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5i</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>The transition of VTA rats from purely linear, cue-directed movement to rotational movement could reflect the progressive recruitment of ascending serial midbrain-striatal circuits across extended training <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , culminating in cue-related dorsal striatal dopamine release and behavioral control <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , especially if more lateral VTA dopamine neurons, which may contribute more directly to movement 10 , are engaged.</s><s>Together these results show that VTA and SNc dopamine neurons contribute to conditioned cue attraction and conditioned movement invigoration in distinct ways, and on different timescales throughout the progression of Pavlovian learning.</s></p><p><s>In addition to being attractive, cues with incentive value can also become desirable, in that they reinforce actions that lead to their procurement.</s><s>This process is critical for durable reward-seeking behaviors when reward is not immediately available.</s><s>Building on the results shown above (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), we next asked if VTA and SNc dopamine optogenetically-conditioned CSs could subsequently serve as conditioned or "secondary" reinforcers, to support performance of a new action in the absence of optogenetic stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>).</s><s>Previouslyconditioned Cre+ paired VTA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>), but not SNc (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>) rats readily pressed a lever to receive conditioned cue presentations in absence of laser activation, indicating that the instantiation of conditioned reinforcement, a canonical test of incentive value properties of cues, is specific to VTA dopamine neurons.</s><s>Furthermore, this shows that, while SNc-paired cues can generate vigorous movement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) the content of the signal conditioned through SNc dopamine neurons in Pavlovian learning is fundamentally distinct from VTA dopamine neurons.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we assessed the primary reinforcing value of dopamine neuron activation in an intracranial self-stimulation paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , where nose pokes resulted in a brief laser train delivery, with no associated cues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>).</s><s>Unlike the anatomical dissociation in conditioned reinforcement, VTA and SNc dopamine neuron stimulation produced similar levels of primary reinforcement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6e</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, our results show that brief, phasic activity of VTA dopamine neurons is sufficient to apply incentive value to previously neutral environmental cues to promote attraction and create conditioned reinforcement.</s><s>SNc dopamine neuron activity, alternatively, imbues cues with conditioned stimulus properties that promote movement invigoration more generally.</s><s>Direct reinforcement of an instrumental action, in contrast to these
