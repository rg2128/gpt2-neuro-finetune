<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p><s>Odor representations are initially formed in the olfactory bulb, which contains a topographic glomerular map of odor molecular features.</s><s>The bulb transmits sensory information directly to piriform cortex where it is encoded by distributed ensembles of pyramidal cells without spatial order.</s><s>Intriguingly, piriform cortex pyramidal cells project back to the bulb, but the information contained in this feedback projection is unknown.</s><s>Here we use imaging in awake mice to directly monitor activity in the presynaptic boutons of cortical feedback fibers.</s><s>We show that the cortex provides the bulb with a rich array of information for any individual odor and that cortical feedback is dependent on brain state.</s><s>In contrast to the stereotyped, spatial arrangement of olfactory bulb glomeruli, cortical inputs tuned to different odors commingle and indiscriminately target individual glomerular channels.</s><s>Thus, the cortex modulates early odor representations by broadcasting sensory information diffusely onto spatially ordered bulbar circuits.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kato et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Wachowiak et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>How does cortical feedback input respond to this change in brain state?</s><s>To address this, we imaged the same boutons in the awake and anesthetized state.</s><s>Anesthesia caused a marked decrease in both spontaneous and odor-evoked cortical feedback (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.2A,B).</s><s>Relative to the awake condition, anesthesia reduced the number of boutons responding with odor-evoked excitation and suppression by 39.6% and 48.8%, respectively (n= 6 imaging fields from 4 mice).</s></p><p><s>During anesthesia the strength of excitatory responses was reduced (p&lt;0.001,</s><s>Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.2C 1 ) and excitation became more narrowly tuned (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.2C 2 ).</s><s>These effects on odor-evoked responses were indistinguishable with ketamine and urethane (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>.2), two chemically distinct anesthetics, suggesting that the differences in bouton activity reflect changes in brain state rather than pharmacological actions of the drugs.</s><s>Furthermore, the duration of odor-evoked excitatory activity became markedly briefer in the anesthetized state (decay time awake = 4.2±0.2</s><s>s, anesthetized = 3.1±0.2</s><s>s, p&lt;0.001,</s><s>KS test, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.2D 1-2 ) while the duration of suppressive responses was slightly enhanced (decay time awake = 2.3±0.1 s, anesthetized = 2.6±0.1 s, p=0.001,</s><s>KS test, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.2D 3-4 ).</s><s>Overall, these results indicate that wakefulness enhances PCx feedback input to olfactory bulb circuits.</s></p><p><s>We next considered the functional organization of cortical projections within the olfactory bulb.</s><s>Do feedback inputs adopt the topographic organization of the bulb such that the tuning of cortical inputs matches that of their target region?</s><s>Or do they retain the diffuse and overlapping nature of odor representations found within the PCx itself?</s><s>The observation that boutons with different tuning properties closely intermingle we found boutons activated by each of the three of the odors (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.4B 1-4 ).</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the probability of bouton responses to a given odor was similar whether the 2-photon imaging field was beneath the glomerulus activated by that odor ("Field 1", Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.4B 3 ,B 4 ) or beneath glomeruli unresponsive to the odor ("Field 2", Fig.</s></p><p><s>2.4B 3 ,B 4 ).</s><s>Overall, for each of the three odors tested, odor-evoked bouton activity was unrelated to the overlying glomerular odor map (n=9 fields beneath active glomeruli, 6 fields beneath non-active glomeruli, n=3 mice, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.4C).</s><s>Similar results were obtained using seven odors and more imaging fields tiling the dorsal olfactory bulb (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>.4).</s><s>Taken together, our results indicate that cortical fibers transmit odorevoked feedback input diffusely over the olfactory bulb without any obvious spatial segregation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study we use in vivo Ca 2+ imaging to reveal the information contained within cortical feedback projections to the olfactory bulb.</s><s>We show that PCx provides the bulb with diverse input: odors cause pyramidal cells to increase or decrease their feedback in a manner ranging from odor selective to apparently un-tuned.</s><s>Compared to the anesthetized condition, wakefulness enhances both the magnitude and duration of excitatory cortical feedback, indicating that the cortical control of olfactory bulb circuits is dependent on brain state.</s><s>Furthermore, although olfactory bulb circuits are spatially arranged to form a stereotyped odor map, PCx projections provide feedback input in a diffuse, intermingled fashion.</s></p></div>			</div>
