<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>How, why, and when consciousness evolved remain hotly debated topics.</s><s>Addressing these issues requires considering the distribution of consciousness across the animal phylogenetic tree.</s><s>Here we propose that at least one invertebrate clade, the insects, has a capacity for the most basic aspect of consciousness: subjective experience.</s><s>In vertebrates the capacity for subjective experience is supported by integrated structures in the midbrain that create a neural simulation of the state of the mobile animal in space.</s><s>This integrated and egocentric representation of the world from the animal's perspective is sufficient for subjective experience.</s><s>Structures in the insect brain perform analogous functions.</s><s>Therefore, we argue the insect brain also supports a capacity for subjective experience.</s><s>In both vertebrates and insects this form of behavioral control system evolved as an efficient solution to basic problems of sensory reafference and true navigation.</s><s>The brain structures that support subjective experience in vertebrates and insects are very different from each other, but in both cases they are basal to each clade.</s><s>Hence we propose the origins of subjective experience can be traced to the Cambrian.</s></p><p><s>subjective experience | primary consciousness | vertebrate midbrain | central complex Consciousness is marked by the presence of subjective experience: In the philosopher's term of art, there is "something it is like" for us to be aware of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Neurotypical adult humans are obviously conscious.</s><s>So are young human children, although we recognize that the nature of consciousness in children is different from that of adults and changes rapidly as children develop.</s><s>Plausibly, some animals also have the capacity for some forms of consciousness-at least, it certainly seems odd to insist that the inner life of a chimp goes on entirely in the dark.</s><s>However, consciousness also gives out somewhere.</s><s>Plants do not have it.</s><s>It would be surprising if jellyfish did.</s><s>Where to draw the line between what is conscious and what is not, and how to justify drawing that line, remain hotly debated questions.</s></p><p><s>These debates are especially difficult when it comes to assessing potential consciousness in invertebrates.</s><s>Methodological challenges are partly to blame.</s><s>The three most common methods of studying consciousness in humans-verbal report, behavioral demonstrations, and neural correlation with conscious activity-generalize poorly to invertebrate models.</s><s>Nonhuman animals cannot give verbal reports about what they are experiencing.</s><s>There have been attempts to deploy to animals behavioral paradigms that are considered evidence of conscious processing when successfully performed by humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>This introduces a strong bias toward anthropomorphic performance by animals.</s><s>As skeptics are quick to note, we have no guarantee that animals that behave like humans do so because they have the same subjective experiences that humans do.</s><s>(Indeed, establishing this is precisely the issue.)</s><s>Further, the bias toward clever animals is itself distorting.</s><s>Many invertebrates live comparatively simple lives, without complex forms of communication and social behavior.</s><s>If one cares about the basic capacity for consciousness and where it came from, one should be prepared to accept that the origins of consciousness may lie in animals that do only very boring, unclever things.</s></p><p><s>The search for the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> is often framed as avoiding the pitfalls of purely behavioral research.</s><s>NCC research focuses on the contents of particular conscious experiences, rather than the overall capacity for subjective experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>NCCs may thus be a poor guide to the more basic shared capacity to have any conscious experiences at all.</s><s>In practice, NCC work also tends toward the anthropocentric, and the best paradigms are still difficult to extend to invertebrates.</s><s>NCC results thus tend to be biased toward complex cortical structures and cannot generalize to animals lacking a cortex.</s></p><p><s>In this review, we will suggest an alternative approach to studying the capacity for subjective experience in invertebrates.</s><s>Neuroethological approaches have made great advances in determining how neurobiological mechanisms within the insect brain generate adaptive behavior.</s><s>We argue that knowledge of these mechanisms can ground an evidence-based inquiry into the capacity for consciousness in insects.</s><s>We begin our argument by discussing the basic features of the simplest forms of consciousness, the capacity to have subjective experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>We then consider structures that support the capacity for subjective experience in humans.</s><s>Following Bjorn Merker <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>, we argue that the human midbrain subserves the basic capacity for subjective experience.</s><s>It does so in virtue of producing an integrated simulation of the state of the animal's own mobile body within the environment.</s><s>We then argue that the insect brain performs similar functions, even though the anatomy of the insect brain is very different from that of vertebrates.</s><s>Insects have specialized brain structures that solve the same basic problems by producing the same kind of unified model.</s><s>We therefore conclude that if subjective experience is indeed supported by midbrain structures in humans, then insects also have the capacity for a form of subjective experience.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we propose that a capacity for subjective experience probably evolved early in the history of animal life for specific animal clades.</s><s>We thus suggest that the study of insects gives a unique comparative perspective on the mechanisms and evolution of consciousness.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Experience and the Vertebrate Midbrain</head><p><s>Behavioral researchers have realized the need to distinguish different levels of consciousness.</s><s>There are many classifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, but each posits a basic form of consciousness that consists of a direct awareness of the world without further reflection upon that awareness.</s><s>This basic level has been termed primary consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, core consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>, phenomenal consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, or "I" consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>The defining feature of this most basic level of consciousness is the appearance of the capacity for subjective experience.</s></p><p><s>Humans are capable of more complex forms of consciousness.</s><s>We can reflect upon our own mental states, for example, which is why verbal reports are so valuable.</s><s>The levels corresponding to these higher capacities are variously termed self-reflexive consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, access consciousness (13), higher-order awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, or "me" consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>These higher forms of consciousness require more than the mere capacity for subjective experience: the ability to represent one's own subjective experience to oneself, awareness of oneself as a self, the possession of the concept of experience, or full linguistic capability.</s></p><p><s>We mention these more complex levels of consciousness to bracket them off.</s><s>It is contentious whether any other higher vertebrates possess them; we think it exceedingly unlikely that any invertebrates do.</s><s>Our argument thus concerns only whether insects have subjective experience.</s><s>Because subjective experience is a simpler phenomenon than self-reflexive consciousness, one might reasonably expect it to be more widespread in the animal kingdom, and evolutionarily older.</s></p><p><s>There is now considerable evidence that, in humans, subjective experience can exist in the absence of self-reflexive consciousness, and that the two are supported by different neural structures.</s><s>Midbrain structures, rather than cortex, seem to be especially important.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Merker (8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>, Parvisi and Damasio <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Damasio and Carvalho (15)</ref>, and Mashour and Alkire <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> have all argued that the integrated structures of the vertebrate midbrain are sufficient to support the capacity for subjective experience.</s></p><p><s>Merker <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> notes that subjective experience is remarkably sensitive to damage to midbrain structures.</s><s>Conversely, there is evidence of preserved consciousness even in patients who lack a cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Further, although cortical damage can have profound effects on the contents of consciousness, damage to any portion of the cortex alone can spare the basic capacity for subjective experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>Cortical damage alone can have profound effects on the contents of consciousness, but even massive cortical damage seems to spare subjective experience itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, there is evidence of residual conscious awareness in patients with severe cortical damage who are otherwise unresponsive to the world, suggesting that preserved subcortical structures may continue to support subjective experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>.</s><s>Although the mechanism of anesthetic action is still debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, there is increasing evidence that the effect of anesthetics depends on the disconnection of cortical circuits from subcortical structures rather than on their direct cortical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>Anesthetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> or electrical stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, which affect cortical midline structures without affecting subcortical structures, do not abolish consciousness; they instead produce unresponsive but conscious dreamlike states.</s><s>Conversely, emergence from anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref> and coma/vegetative state <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> are predicted by the reengagement of subcortical structures and reintegration of those structures with cortical circuits.</s><s>Other authors have noted the powerful subcortical effect of drugs, endogenous peptides, and direct stimulation on primitive motivational states <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In sum, there is good evidence that subcortical structures underlie the basic capacity for subjective experience in humans.</s><s>This is not to say that the cortex is unimportant for conscious experience, of course.</s><s>Rather, the proposal is that subcortical structures support the basic capacity for experience, the detailed contents of which might be elaborated by or otherwise depend upon cortical structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How the Vertebrate Midbrain Supports the Capacity for Subjective Experience</head><p><s>We will adopt and expand the account given by Merker <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, who argues that subjective experience arises from interacting midbrain and basal ganglia structures creating an integrated simulation of the state of the animal's own mobile body within the environment.</s></p><p><s>Merker suggests that an important function of the midbrain is to combine interoceptive (stimuli arising from within the body) and exteroceptive (stimuli external to the body) sensory information.</s><s>Information on the environment, and the location and movement of the animal within it, is processed within the roof of the midbrain (the tectum, or colliculus in mammals).</s><s>Information about homeostatic needs is processed within the floor of the midbrain (the hypothalamus and associated structures).</s><s>Nuclei located between these poles integrate this information to produce a unified multimodal neural model of the spatial location of resources relative to the animal, which is coupled to, and weighted by, the extent to which different resources are needed by the animal (8) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Vertebrates organize their behavior by reference to this integrated model of the environment rather than by reacting to independent sensory inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In mammals the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) receive topographically organized visual inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, whereas the deeper layers receive topographically organized visual, auditory, and somatosensory input <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>.</s><s>In some species, specialized spatial senses such as infrared and magneto-and electrosenses and echolocation send topographically organized inputs to the SC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>Within a species, the sensory topographic maps in different layers of the SC are superposed, meaning specific regions of space are represented by similar points in each overlaid sensory map <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</s><s>This arrangement allows a point of convergence for processed spatially structured information, in turn allowing an integrated sense of space that includes the position, state, and movement of the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Organizing behavior by reference to an integrated simulation of the state of the mobile body in space also provides an efficient neural solution for resolving the confusing sensory input caused by self-motion [the so-called reafference problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>].</s><s>Bodily motion causes widespread changes in sensory input, yet we seamlessly disambiguate our own movements from the movements of objects around us.</s><s>In mammals, the multisensory inputs to the SC include inputs from the vestibular system ( <ref type="formula">44</ref>), information on eye position <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>, and somatosensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>This allows the influence of self-motion on the sensory fields to be factored out of the constructed sensory model of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s><s>Resolving the reafference problem is a key function for the mammalian SC, which is why this region is vital for organizing motion in space for directed attention, reaching, and grasping for targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For active animals with well-developed spatial senses, it is computationally more effective to resolve the reafference problem once for a unified sensory model than to resolve it in a dispersed and peripheral way for each sense independently.</s><s>Further, different senses are affected by reafference in different ways and contribute different information on how the body is moving.</s><s>Reafference can thus be resolved with greater accuracy and precision by integrating information from multiple senses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For mammals, the processing performed within the SC constructs something akin to a simulation of the moving body in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>For humans at least, this spatial "model" is further enhanced by processing within the subcortical dorsal pulvinar (one of the thalamic nuclei, part of the basal ganglia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, which adds color, three-dimensionality, and an egocentric first-person perspective to the human conscious experience of space.</s><s>A major benefit of this integrated spatial simulation is that it allows animals to interact with objects in a qualitatively different set of ways than simple stimulus-bound organisms could manage.</s><s>Animals that navigate by reference to a simulated spatial model can actively seek out and navigate toward hidden objects.</s><s>It is worth emphasizing what is implied by such an apparently simple navigational ability.</s><s>A food source concealed behind a barrier, for example, is neither part of an organism's current sensory input nor accessible by following a simple vector with its origin at the animal's current position.</s><s>Navigation requires a unified metric space that allows for effective computation of relative position after both actual and hypothetical translations within that space <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>.</s><s>This is beyond the primary sensory input but can be supported by a simulation of the environment constructed from that input <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The midbrain also provides the capacity to resolve competing behavioral priorities or motivations and rank needed resources by both urgency and availability.</s><s>The floor of the midbrain is formed by the hypothalamic structures and associated nuclei whose function is to integrate information from the nervous and endocrine systems, to harvest and respond to information on the physiological status of the organism, and to motivate behavior to maintain a homeostatic optimum (56) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Maintaining homeostasis requires actively seeking needed resources; hence, midbrain structures are critical for the initiation and direction of a wide range of goal-directed behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56)</ref>.</s><s>Integrative structures within the midbrain and basal ganglia, including the periaqueductal gray, substantia nigra, ventral thalamus, striatum, and midbrain reticular formation, combine this information on introspective assessment of state with exteroceptive assessment of ).</s><s>These domains interact and can be resolved by referencing an integrated neural model that contains information on the state of self, self movement, environmental state and structure, and memory of prior experience.</s><s>These elements of the neural model are supported by midbrain structures (B).</s><s>As a simplification, regions are colored according to their primary function(s) in the neural model described in A. The superior colliculus [part of the tectum (TEC) forming the roof of the midbrain] receives topographically organized multisensory input and creates an integrated neural model of the organism moving in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>The floor of the midbrain is formed by the hypothalamic structures (Hyp) and associated nuclei [pituitary (pt) and mammillary bodies (M)] that collate information on the physiological status of the organism referenced with prior experience, to identify needs to maintain a homeostatic optimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56)</ref>.</s><s>Integrative structures within the midbrain and basal ganglia, including the periaqueductal gray (P), substantia nigra (N), thalamus (Tha), striatum (St), and midbrain reticular formation (MR), integrate these sources of information (8, 33) (A).</s><s>In advanced vertebrates the cortex and hippocampal structures clearly have a very strong input in to this system, but this midbrain system is not dependent on cortical inputs to function <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(140)</ref> and is highly conserved across all vertebrate lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>location in space to collate and resolve competing motivations, prioritize resources, and select targets and actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Midbrain and basal ganglia structures thus provide an effective and efficient neural solution for decision making (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Competing and potentially conflicting behavioral responses that might be stimulated by different inputs can be resolved within a single behavioral control system <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57)</ref>.</s><s>Target selection and action selection must interact (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) because each domain informs the others.</s><s>Motivational factors will influence the prioritization of targets and therefore action selection, but the location of targets will also influence which is selected, and which actions should be taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Merker <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref> describes this as a "behavioral core control system" within which these decision domains can be resolved.</s><s>Analyses and modeling of basal ganglia function in vertebrates have emphasized how drawing together all evidence for different possible actions within a unified neural system enables an effective and efficient solution for action selection, without having to posit a higher-level decision maker reflecting on the decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Placing the basic capacity for subjective experience in subcortical structures does not rule out a role for the cortex and other subcortical systems (including hippocampal systems) in conscious experience.</s><s>The contents of subjective experience will vary enormously between species, and that variation will depend in part on the degree of elaboration of cortical structures.</s><s>However, the capacity for subjective experience is not dependent on containing any particular contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</s><s>The basic capacity for subjective experience that the midbrain supports is rather a capacity to have any subjective contents at all.</s></p><p><s>The midbrain thus provides a forum for specific contents to be integrated together with more basic survival-oriented machinery.</s><s>However, the modeling function of the midbrain does not require some overseer that reflects on the model [the fallacy of the "Cartesian theater" <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>].</s><s>Decisions arise directly from this model, not from some further decision-making process informed by the model.</s></p><p><s>It is worth distinguishing the current proposal for the substrate of subjective experience from other, related, accounts.</s><s>Like global workspace theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>, we emphasize the role of consciousness in bringing together disparate brain processes into a common arena.</s><s>Global workspace theories have a strongly cortical bias, however, focusing on the contribution of human fronto-parietal regions to reflective self-awareness of our mental states.</s><s>It is unclear how widely this generalizes.</s><s>We propose that even for invertebrates-which lack anything remotely like an elaborate cortex-holistic integration is essential for the more basic, evolutionarily ancient behavioral demands of action selection, reafference adjustment, and navigation.</s><s>Further, insofar as cortical processes can matter to the organism, we argue that they must ultimately be integrated via midbrain mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref>.</s><s>As Merker (8) puts it, the midbrain control system is "anatomically subcortical [but] functionally supra-cortical."</s></p><p><s>Like information integration theories of consciousness (63-65), we claim that consciousness performs an important synthetic role.</s><s>Unlike information integration theories, however, it matters which information is unified.</s><s>Subjective experience requires the construction of an integrated neural simulation of the agent in space, weighted by the state of the agent.</s><s>This simulation is constructed from appropriate integration of afferent, efferent, and homeostatic information.</s><s>Just integrating information is not sufficient for subjective experience, no matter how complex or well-integrated the information.</s><s>Information integration theorists have also tended to take a more liberal and graded view of consciousness, suggesting that even simple circuits such as a photodiode attached to memory might have a "modicum of experience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>.</s><s>By contrast, our theory implies that there is a definite cutoff point below which there is definitely not subjective experience (a point to which we will return).</s></p><p><s>Unified modeling provides effective solutions to the reafference problem and action selection for motile animals with developed spatially coherent senses (such as vision) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67)</ref>.</s><s>As such, it is not surprising that the vertebrate midbrain behavioral core control system evolved early on in the group and has been largely conserved since.</s><s>Lampreys (primitive jawless fish) have functional homologs of all of the key nuclei involved in the vertebrate behavioral core control system (sensu ref. 8) including a well-developed tectum to process spatially structured visual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69)</ref> and equivalents of the basal ganglia system to resolve action and target selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70)</ref>.</s><s>It is thus a commitment of our model that subjective experience is likely to be universal among the vertebrates.</s><s>What about invertebrate groups?</s></p></div>

likely to be more extensive than previously thought, but far from universal.</s><s>One of the virtues of the account we have endorsed is that it also gives an evidence-based argument for where to draw the line between the haves and have-nots.</s><s>There are other, simpler ways to organize animal behavior than by creating the kind of integrated neural simulation seen in the insect and vertebrate core control systems.</s><s>These simpler systems cannot support a capacity for subjective experience.</s></p><p><s>An informative, if simple, example is the cubozoan box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora.</s><s>This species shows dynamic behavior that includes actively hunting its prey.</s><s>It has a well-developed geosense and visual sense thanks to 24 lensed eyes distributed around the

change in the swimming direction and speed of the animal <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(112)</ref>, but the simple behavioral control system is entirely decentralized.</s><s>Although such systems manifest the appearance of adaptive and dynamic targeting, they are nothing more than simple decentralized stimulus-response systems.</s><s>They could not reasonably be expected to support any form of subjective experience.</s></p><p><s>Centralization is necessary for subjective experience, but it is not sufficient.</s><s>The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses a famously simple and well-characterized centralized nervous system that can integrate input from an array of thermo-, mechano-, chemo-, and nociceptors, along with an interoceptive sense of time to organize directed movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(113)</ref>.</s><s>Sensory inputs are integrated at the level of an array of interneurons that compete for activation of the motor neurons <ref type="bibr"

nervous system, but it seems that their behavior is organized as responses either to the immediate sensory environment or to immediate interoceptive signals of physiological state.</s><s>Action selection in nematodes is driven by shifts in global brain dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(119)</ref>, and there is sufficient plasticity in the nematode nervous system for their responses to vary with system state (120).</s><s>However, there is no evidence that nematodes can actively hunt for things beyond their immediate sensory environment.</s><s>Hungry nematodes respond to starvation with increased locomotion and dispersal in a random, rather than directed, search <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122)</ref>.</s><s>By contrast,

target="#b124">(125)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, in mammals and insects homeostatic drives direct behavior to where resources are expected to be, even if they are not currently there.</s><s>We argue the difference between this behavior and nematode search behavior arises because nematode behavior is organized by reference to their primary sensory input, whereas rodent and insect behavior is organized in response to an integrated and spatial simulation of their environment.</s><s>Nematodes do possess forms of memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(116)</ref> that can change how they react to stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(120)</ref>, but there is no evidence this memory has a spatial component or contributes to a structured model of their environment.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, even though nematodes have a centralized nervous system and memory, they lack the egocentric modeling of the environment that is required for subjective experience.</s><s>Further, it is because they lack the capacity to make such models that they are unable to do a variety of tasks that vertebrates and insects handle with ease.</s><s>As a group, nematodes may have evolved a simplified body plan

of behavior such as hunting.</s><s>It is plausible that some of the Cambrian fauna within both the basal vertebrate and arthropod groups had a capacity for subjective experience.</s></p><p><s>It is
