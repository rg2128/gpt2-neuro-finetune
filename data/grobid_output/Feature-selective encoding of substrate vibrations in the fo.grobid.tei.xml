tactile vibration applied to a single point on the skin (e.g. at fingertips) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Harvey et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mountcastle et al., 1969)</ref>.</s><s>How can this discrepancy be explained?</s><s>Localized oscillatory indentations of the skin surface constitute ecologically relevant vibrotactile sensations for primates, which might occur during active tactile exploration.</s><s>The associated sensation is most likely conveyed to the central nervous system by dermal PCs that densely populate the primate fingertips <ref type="bibr">(Kumamoto et al., 1993a)</ref>.</s><s>On the contrary, we found no evidence that dermal PCs exist in the mouse forepaw (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S6</ref>), which has been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fleming and Luo, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This finding might also support the view that rodents principally use their whiskers rather than their paws for active tactile exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Diamond et al., 2008)</ref> (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Manita et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Maricich et al., 2012)</ref>).</s><s>Forepaw-based vibration sensation in rodents might thus take the role of passive "listening" through the substrate as the communication medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hill, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The activation of deep, subcutaneous PCs populating the distal forelimb at large might synergistically participate in processing the vibratory stimuli.</s><s>The associated activity in the multiple afferent channels might be individually filtered and eventually converge onto cortical neurons with frequency selective spike rates.</s><s>The frequency-dependent effect of our pharmacological experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>) and the absence of a one-to-one correspondence between neurons driven by selective afferent activation and forepaw vibration (Fig. <ref type="figure">7D</ref>) are consistent with this hypothesis.</s><s>On the other hand, localized skin vibrations in primate fingertips drive cortical neurons with firing properties corresponding more closely to those of individual dermal PC afferents <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mackevicius et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Talbot et al., 1968)</ref>.</s><s>Besides the difference in receptor distribution found between the mouse and primate, we can ask more generally: do the two different spectral information coding schemes (rate code vs. cyclical entrainment) have different functional implications?</s><s>We speculate that they might reflect a fundamental difference between active and passive sensing.</s><s>Active somatosensory systems need to take the kinematics of the active motion into account when extracting low-level stimulus features.</s><s>Such timing dependent sensory-motor integration might therefore explain temporally precise coding in the cortex, as described by cyclical spike entrainment for example <ref type="bibr">(Ewert et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Harvey et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mountcastle et al., 1969)</ref>.</s><s>Instead, cortical feature-selective rate coding in the primate fingertip or the rodent whisker systems have most likely evolved to identify macroscopic object features like surface texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Garion et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Isett et al., 2018)</ref> or edge orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bensmaia et al., 2008)</ref>, independently of motion kinematics.</s><s>On the other hand, passive sensory systems, such as hearing or sensing substrate vibrations do not rely on active motion and have most likely evolved to directly identify and discriminate lower level physical parameters like frequency or pitch using a tuned rate code <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Eggermont, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>This distinction is directly supported by psychophysical experiments comparing how humans perceive the spectral information of sound and skin vibrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Formby et al., 1992)</ref>.</s><s>However, both coding schemes are probably highly overlapping and might even use the information of the same receptors, yet via segregated circuits.</s><s>Future experiments will be necessary to investigate if such parallel coding systems exist, for example at the level of the primate hand.</s><s>Interestingly, we found that the responses to forelimb vibrations described here not only share many features with the auditory system, the frequency range represented (100 Hz to 1.5 kHz, Fig. <ref type="figure">2L</ref>) is also surprisingly complementary to the auditory hearing range of the mouse (4kHz to 50kHz) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Koay et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The passive sensing of substrate vibrations might thus be a natural extension of the mouse auditory system to the lower, inaudible frequency range.</s><s>Actually, it has been proposed that communication via airborne sounds might have evolved from the more ancient precursor modality based on substrate-borne vibration signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hill, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Many insect species communicate exclusively by emitting and sensing substrate vibrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cocroft and Rodríguez, 2005)</ref> while in others, the same sensory organ, such as the Johnston's organ in drosophila, is used to detect both sound and touch <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Azevedo and Wilson, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Vestiges of this modality seem to be still present in
