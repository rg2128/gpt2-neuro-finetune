and that this enhancement is driven largely by the weakest responding glomeruli of the representation.</s><s>As calcium increases measured within a glomerulus reflect a population M/T cells, the increased responses following learning seen in some glomeruli could reflect increases in individual M/T cell activity, recruitment of additional M/T cells associated with the glomerulus, or both.</s><s>Similar results have been reported in insects, with associative conditioning leading to enhanced principle neuron activity into the antennae lobe glomerular representation of the trained odorant <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Faber et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Daly et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Yu et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>However, unlike similar studies in Drosophila where previously unresponsive glomeruli were recruited into the odor representation following associative conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Yu et al., 2004)</ref>, we found no instances of recruitment of new glomeruli following conditioning.</s><s>While we did observe some glomeruli in the Paired animals that significantly increased, we did not observe any large-scale changes in response amplitude across all glomeruli following learning.</s><s>This is in contrast to earlier studies in rat pups that have reported an overall decrease in odor-evoked M/T cell responses following associative conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wilson et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wilson and Leon, 1988)</ref>.</s><s>Unlike these studies, we found very few instances of decreases in M/T glomerular odor responses following learning.</s><s>There are several potential reasons for this difference.</s><s>First, increased fluorescence in calcium indicators observed in M/T dendritic glomerular tufts reflects a combination of calcium influx from OSN-driven activation of NMDA receptors, dendritic-initiated spiking, and back-propagating somaticinitiated action potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yuan et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zou et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fletcher et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It is likely that the learninginduced increases in M/T cell odor-evoked suppression reported in the earlier electrophysiological studies are driven by changes in deeper granule cell mediated inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brennan and Keverne, 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Given the strong calcium signals observed in M/T dendritic tufts in response to OSN input <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zou et al., 2006)</ref>, it is possible that this deeper level inhibition in M/T cell output is masked when only observing activity in the tuft.</s><s>Another potential explanation lies in the fact that the studies mentioned above <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wilson et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wilson and Leon, 1988)</ref> were performed in rat pups and our study was performed in adult mice.</s><s>As it is clear that infants rodents possess a unique and immature olfactory system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Greer et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Raineki et al., 2010)</ref>, it is possible that the olfactory learning in infants and adults utilizes different mechanisms.</s><s>Finally, it is important to note that our technique only allows us to observe glomerular odor representations located across the dorsal surface.</s><s>2-DG mapping studies in mice have shown that methyl valerate activates a cluster of glomeruli in the posterior-lateral region of the OB as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Johnson et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>With our technique, we can only observe the glomerular representation on the dorsal surface and we may be missing the effects of training on glomeruli located in other regions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF GLOMERULAR PLASTICITY</head><p><s>As M/T cell odor responses reflect a combination of input from sensory neurons, interneuronal inhibition, and neuromodulatory input from centrifugal cortical and neuromodulatory regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kosaka and Kosaka, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fletcher and Chen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kiyokage et al., 2010)</ref>, one possible mechanism behind this effect could involve Hebbian plasticity at the level of ORN input into the bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ennis et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>In this case, it is possible that the simultaneous activation of OB neurons by ORN input and centrifugal activation via foot shock creates the conditions necessary to induce long-term changes in the sensitivity of the ORN-M/T cell synapse.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, it is possible that the enhanced glomerular responses following associative conditioning could be caused by learning-dependent structural changes within the glomerular layer.</s><s>For example, associative conditioning has also been shown to increase the size of glomeruli responsive to the trained odorant <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Woo et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jones et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In one case, this size increase appears to be due to increases in the number of ORN axons innervating the glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Jones et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>While interesting, it is unlikely that similar anatomical reorganization is driving the increased responses seen in glomeruli in this study, as the changes observed in these studies required several days of associative conditioning and our study look at responses the day immediately following training.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ODOR DISCRIMINATION AND PERCEPTION</head><p><s>The post-training enhancement of glomerular response seen here could have several consequences on M/T cell odor coding.</s></p><p><s>First, the increased responses following training could serve to increase sensitivity in the weaker glomeruli, possibly decreasing behavioral detection thresholds.</s><s>Second, enhanced glomerular responses may lead to a shift in glomerular odor receptive fields (ORFs).</s><s>In the auditory system, neuronal RFs can be shifted away from their preferred frequency and toward the paired frequency following tone-foot shock pairings <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lennartz and Weinberger, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Edeline et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, odorant experience has been shown to shift M/T cell ORFs toward the experienced odor <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fletcher and Wilson, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Together these changes could lead to a decorrelation of the representation of the trained odor and other similar odorants, possibly making the trained odor more discriminable.</s><s>In line with this, behavioral discrimination experiments in both rats and humans studies have demonstrated increased olfaction acuity following associative conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rabin, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fletcher and Wilson, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Linster et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Li et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>(Means: Day 1 = 5.31% F/F; Day 4 = 4.55% F/F; Day 8 = 4.42% F/F) ANOVA, Main effect of day: [F (2, 60) = 4.78, p = 0.03].</s><s>Despite this, no significant decrease was observed in any group following training (D4-D8 comparisons; post hoc Fisher's tests: Shock Only: p = 0.61, ns; Odor Only: p = 0.22, ns; Paired: p = 0.73, ns).</s><s>During imaging, normalized responses remained stable across the first two sessions (Day1 and Day4) with the number</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
