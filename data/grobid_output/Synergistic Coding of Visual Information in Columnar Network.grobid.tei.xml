Olshausen, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, natural scenes have strong spatial correlations that cause wide groups of cortical cells with overlapping receptive fields to participate in encoding any single individual feature present in the image.</s><s>This view, which remains highly influential, has led to the idea that a major goal of sensory systems is to reduce the redundancy of neuronal responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Attneave, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barlow, 1961)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, theories of efficient coding have long predicted that sensory processing acts to reduce the redundancy of the neural code by removing correlations present between neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Atick and Redlich, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barlow,

target="#b30">Laughlin, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rieke et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Although redundancy may offer possible advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barlow, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Puchalla et al., 2005)</ref>, it is achieved at a cost in coding efficiency, as more neurons participate to represent the same information than would be necessary.</s></p><p><s>Although the influential finding of redundant coding in sensory cortex may suggest that this coding scheme has been firmly established, several limitations of previous studies prevent this conclusion.</s><s>First, previous work has relied on neuronal recordings in vitro in the retina <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Doi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Puchalla et al., 2005)</ref> or in vivo in sensory cortex during anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Montani et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reich et al.,

2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sch√∂lvinck et al., 2015)</ref>, and correlated activity has been typically linked to redundant coding schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Attneave, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barlow, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gutnisky and Dragoi, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Second, redundancy was previously observed when multiple neurons were recorded tangentially across the cortical surface and not along the cortical column <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Montani et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reich et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, we confirmed previous findings and observed similar redundancy-dominated information encoding in tangential recordings from the superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Cortical columns have been hypothesized to be the elementary functional and computational module of the neocortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Rakic, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mountcastle, 1997)</ref>, and columnar structure coupled with laminar morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hubel and Wiesel, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lund and Boothe, 1975)</ref> have been intriguing subjects of study over the past several decades.</s><s>Although we know much about anatomy, cell types, input-output architecture, and recurrent connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Briggs and Callaway, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr"

column process information redundantly or synergistically is unknown.</s><s>Third, the timescales used to compute redundancy in previous studies were much shorter than those normally experienced during wakefulness, such as those occurring during natural viewing when each gaze fixation lasts for hundreds of milliseconds.</s></p><p><s>We re-examined the idea of redundant coding in neocortex by measuring the amount of information about visual stimuli transmitted by neurons within a microcolumn in awake monkey primary visual cortex (V1) at a timescale relevant for visual perception.</s><s>We found significant synergistic interactions between nearby neurons that were clustered nonrandomly across cortical layers to form synergy and redundancy hubs.</s><s>Neuronal populations comprising only synergy hubs were significantly better at decoding stimulus information compared to redundancy hubs or populations comprising both synergy and redundancy hubs.</s></p><p><s>These findings suggest that the generality of the redundant coding idea in sensory cortex needs to be revisited.</s><s>That is, columnar neuronal populations can efficiently encode information due to synergistic inter-neuronal interactions, even when receptive fields overlap and shared noise between cells is high.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Spike trains were recorded from multiple V1 neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>; n = 201 single units) in two fixating monkeys using multi-contact laminar arrays advanced perpendicularly to the cortical surface.</s><s>Stimuli consisted of five sine-wave gratings flashed for 300 ms and presented at equally spaced orientations within 20¬∞ of the cells' optimal orientation.</s><s>Gratings were 5¬∞ in diameter, i.e., large enough to cover the receptive fields of all the neurons recorded by the linear array (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Spatial frequency was chosen to maximize the number of V1 neurons that were driven in a session (average number of presentations of each stimulus per session was 84 ¬± 13).</s><s>Because recordings were performed in a cortical column, cells had largely overlapping receptive fields and were tuned to the same stimulus orientation <ref type="bibr">(Figures S2A and S2B)</ref>.</s><s>Representative examples of V1 responses of five single units to multiple presentations of sine wave gratings are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>.</s><s>From these responses, we calculated the bias-corrected amount of mutual information that spike timing and spike counts carried about stimulus orientation (STAR Methods) as a function of time, from 200 ms before stimulus onset to 1,000 ms poststimulus onset.</s><s>Because the responses of cortical neurons are noisy, it is difficult to estimate the precise time of the first spike in response to the stimulus.</s><s>Therefore, for each time t, we computed the information conveyed by the preceding spike and interspike interval (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>To compare these information values with those based on spike counts, at each instant of time t, we calculated the information conveyed by spike counts in windows of different sizes: 10; 50; 100; 200; 300; and 400 ms.</s></p><p><s>Despite the great variability in the amount of information conveyed by pairs of neurons, there was a clear increase in mutual information about 40 ms after stimulus onset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>), which is expected given the time the visually evoked neural impulses need to reach primary visual cortex.</s><s>Contrary to findings in the retina <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berry et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gollisch and Meister, 2008)</ref>, spike counts were more informative than spike times and spike intervals in neuronal pairs (this was also true for single neurons; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C</ref>).</s><s>Hence, we focused our subsequent analysis on the 300-ms time window, as spike counts in this window were most informative and matched the duration of the flashed stimulus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2D</ref>).</s><s>As expected, the peak mutual information carried by pairs of neurons represents an almost two-fold increase in information relative to that carried by single cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We further examined whether combinations of cells jointly convey less information (redundant coding), the same information (independent coding), or more information (synergistic coding) in their spike counts compared to the sum of the information conveyed independently by individual neurons.</s><s>On average, the amount of information encoded jointly by a pair of cells was not significantly higher (p &gt; 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum) than the sum of the information provided by the two neurons forming the pair (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>; the difference between these two quantities was labeled ŒîI).</s><s>Although this may suggest that pairs of neurons encode stimuli in an independent manner, when ŒîI was analyzed separately for each pair (STAR Methods), we observed a significant number of pairs exhibiting synergistic ŒîI &gt; 0; p &lt; 0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>) and redundant interactions (ŒîI &lt; 0; p &lt; 0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons).</s><s>However, when ŒîI was averaged across all the pairs, we failed to observe either net synergy or redundancy <ref type="bibr">(Figure 1G,</ref><ref type="bibr">inset)</ref>.</s><s>Out of 1,031 pairs, 43% were synergistic, 47% were redundant, and the remaining 10% were independent (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>).</s><s>Thus, contrary to previous findings originating from tangential recordings across the cortical surface (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), cortical columns in awake macaque V1 are characterized by a large proportion of synergistic pairs.</s><s>Although synergistic pairs were slightly less abundant than redundant pairs, they carried significantly more information about incoming stimuli (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1I</ref>; p &lt; 0.0001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</s><s>To examine whether these results extend beyond pairwise interactions, we calculated synergy and redundancy for triplets (n = 4,034) and quadruplets (n = 12,526; Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A-S3F</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, approximately 40% of triplets and quadruplets were synergistic.</s><s>These synergistic groups carried more stimulus information compared to their redundant counterparts, which is consistent with the results found in pairs.</s></p><p><s>To quantify the relative strength of synergy and redundancy, we calculated the peak synergy and redundancy fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Montani et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">STAR Methods)</ref> for the two separate groups of pairs.</s><s>We found that, on average, synergistic pairs provided approximately 45% more information than the sum of the individual information values provided by the neurons forming the pair, and redundant pairs provided approximately 40% less information.</s><s>The strength of synergistic and redundant interactions gradually increased as spike counts were calculated over larger windows (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J</ref>).</s><s>Contrary to previous studies, these findings provide evidence for strong synergy and redundancy, and relatively little independence, within the cortical columns of V1.</s></p><p><s>In principle, one might expect that nearby neurons within a column would have similar tuning curves, and hence, cells separated by smaller distances would mostly have redundant interactions.</s><s>In that case, our results would simply reflect a distance-based encoding rule.</s><s>However, we found no significant difference in cortical distance between the neurons forming synergistic and redundant pairs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1K</ref>; p &gt; 0.05; Wilcoxon rank sum test).</s><s>It might also be possible that small differences in tuning preference or mean firing rates between the cells in a pair could be associated with synergistic or redundant interactions.</s><s>Therefore, we calculated the difference in tuning preferences and the mean firing rates but did not observe significant differences between the distributions for pairs corresponding to synergistic and redundant interactions (tuning preference: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3G</ref>, Watson-Williams test; p &gt; 0.05; firing rates: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3H</ref>, one-way balanced ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons test; p &gt; 0.05).</s><s>Altogether, these results demonstrate that synergistic interactions cannot simply be explained in terms of spatial proximity, tuning differences, or firing rate differences between the cells in a pair.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synergy and Redundancy Hubs</head><p><s>We further examined whether we can identify neurons preferentially engaging in synergistic or redundant interactions with the rest of the cells in a column or whether interactions are mixed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>That is, do some neurons have a higher probability than others to establish synergistic or redundant interactions?</s><s>To examine this issue, we calculated the participation coefficient (PC) of a neuron as the fraction of interactions that were either synergistic or redundant.</s><s>For example, a neuron with 7 synergistic and 3 redundant pairwise interactions would have a participation coefficient of 0.7 for synergy and 0.3 for redundancy.</s><s>To assess the statistical significance of the PC values, we calculated the normalized participation coefficient (PC norm ) by randomly assigning the same number of redundant and synergistic interactions between neurons (STAR Methods).</s><s>The normalized coefficient was obtained by dividing the actual PC for a neuron by the mean PC calculated from the randomized set.</s><s>Neurons that had a participation coefficient &gt;0.5 and normalized participation coefficient significantly &gt;1 (see STAR Methodsfor statistical testing) were labeled as synergy or redundancy "hubs," depending on which interaction dominated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Neurons not satisfying this criterion were labeled as "non-hubs."</s><s>We found that approximately 26% of the neurons in our population were synergy hubs, whereas 37% were redundancy hubs.</s><s>This demonstrates that synergistic and redundant interactions do cluster such that some neurons preferentially participate in one or the other type of interaction with their neighbors.</s><s>However, there was no significant difference in mean cortical distance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>) between the neurons forming synergy and redundancy hubs (p &gt; 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</s></p><p><s>What could be the functional role of such hubs?</s><s>To answer this question, we built subpopulations of neurons consisting of varying numbers of synergy and redundancy hubs (STAR Methods) and examined their impact on stimulus decoding.</s><s>For instance, to construct a homogeneous sub-population consisting of 5 neurons, all five neurons were randomly sampled from the pool of either synergy or redundancy hubs in a particular session.</s><s>Heterogeneous sub-populations of five neurons were constructed by selecting different numbers of synergy and redundancy hubs, e.g., 3 synergy hubs were combined with 2 redundancy hubs or 1 synergy hub was combined with 4 redundancy hubs, etc. (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>All possible drawings of neurons from the synergy and redundancy pools were used to construct these sub-populations.</s><s>We subsequently used a linear discriminant classifier to decode stimulus identity using the spike count responses of the neurons in each subpopulation.</s><s>We normalized decoder accuracy with respect to that of sub-populations containing only redundancy hubs for each session.</s><s>There was an increase in peak decoder accuracy as the percentage of synergy hubs was increased (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref> shows one example session).</s><s>The lowest decoder accuracy was obtained for homogeneous populations exclusively consisting of redundancy hubs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>To compare across sessions, we normalized decoder accuracy for each sub-population (homogeneous or heterogeneous) by the lowest performance (hence, the normalized decoder accuracy had values &gt;1 for different sub-populations).</s><s>Across sessions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3I-S3K</ref>), there was a clear increase in mean normalized decoder accuracy with the increase in the number of synergy hubs in the populations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>; n = 11 sessions; p &lt; 0.001; one-way balanced ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons test).</s><s>Normalized decoder accuracy was not significantly greater than 1 (p &gt; 0.05; t test) for sub-populations where less than half of neurons were synergy hubs.</s><s>There was a 20% increase in decoder accuracy between sub-populations with only synergy compared to only redundancy hubs.</s><s>Altogether, these results indicate that there is a specialized subgroup of neurons encoding more stimulus information, and these cells tend to form hubs of synergistic interactions.</s></p><p><s>Next, we examined the nature of the interactions between synergy and redundancy hubs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, are synergy-synergy hub interactions predominantly synergistic or redundant?</s><s>Across sessions (STAR Methods), we found that the probability that synergy hubs interact synergistically with each other is 75% ¬± 5%, and the probability that redundancy hubs interact synergistically is only 26% ¬± 6% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>However, one might expect that, by chance, a synergy hub would interact primarily through synergistic interactions with other synergy hubs.</s><s>Therefore, the probability of a synergistic interaction between two synergy hubs would be high, and the same could be expected for redundancy hubs.</s><s>To control for this possibility, we calculated the probability of different types of hubhub interactions by shuffling the interaction labels across the population of pairs while holding the total number of synergistic or redundant interactions for each neuron the same as in the actual data.</s><s>From these "randomized" networks, we calculated a distribution of interaction percentages for each type of hub-hub interaction, and if the actual interaction percentage was greater than the mean of this distribution (p &lt; 0.05; right-tailed Wilcoxon sign rank test), that session was included for analysis (STAR Methods).</s><s>Across sessions, the probabilities of 2 nd -order interaction between hubs were statistically different from 50% (p &lt; 0.001; two-tailed Wilcoxon sign rank test).</s><s>However, interactions between synergy and redundancy hubs are equally likely to be synergistic or redundant (not significantly different from 50%; two-tailed Wilcoxon sign rank test;

layers, they belong to different cortical columns (interelectrode spacing up to 4 mm) and hence different preferred orientations.</s><s>In that case, neuronal responses are primarily influenced by lateral (short-and long-range cortical connections).</s><s>On the other hand, the neurons in superficial layers recorded by our laminar array have identical stimulus preference and overlapping

that the raw ŒîI values of synergy and redundancy measured in columnar networks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>) are too small to significantly impact information coding.</s><s>First, it is noteworthy that the ŒîI values are small because the recorded columnar neurons have very similar tuning preferences, which implies homogeneous tuning curves for the recorded

This yields a symmetric 10 √ó 10 matrix that summarizes the structure of interactions between all possible pairs.</s><s>PC syn was calculated by dividing the number of synergistic interactions a neuron had, by the total number of possible interactions that the neuron can have with the rest of the recorded neurons in a session.</s><s>Participation coefficient for redundant interactions was calculated in a similar way, except considering the redundant interactions of a neuron.</s><s>To generate values of PC expected by chance we created a new shuffled 10 √ó 10 matrix by assigning the same number of +1 s (synergistic interactions) and -1 s (redundant interactions) at random.</s><s>This creates a shuffled interaction matrix which has the same number of interactions of each type, but assigned randomly between pairs.</s><s>One can calculate the participation coefficient for synergistic and redundant interactions for each neuron in this new shuffled matrix.</s><s>Multiple realizations of the shuffled interaction matrix (N = 500) can then be used to create a distribution of participation coefficient values expected from random assignment of synergistic and redundant interactions without any structure.</s><s>If there is non-random structure in the actual data, the participation coefficients should be significantly higher than those calculated from the shuffled realizations of the interaction matrix.</s><s>A distribution of PC norm values was generated by dividing the actual PC value and the shuffled PC values.</s><s>A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to ascertain whether the median of the distribution was greater than 1.</s><s>Neurons with PC &gt; 0.5 and PC norm significantly &gt; 1 were assigned as synergistic or redundant hubs depending upon which interaction dominated.</s><s>Hence, in our case a neuron is a synergy hub not only if it has more synergistic interactions compared to redundant, but also if its participation coefficient is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance for a neuron with the same number of synergistic and redundant interactions.</s></p><p><s>Hub interaction analysis-For each session we examined the pairwise interactions between synergy and redundancy hubs.</s><s>The percentage of synergistic interactions was calculated by dividing the number of synergistic interactions within the group by the total number of possible interactions.</s><s>The same analysis was done for within-group interactions for redundancy hubs.</s><s>We also calculated the percentage of synergistic interactions between synergistic and redundancy hubs.</s><s>To control for the fact that by chance the probability of synergistic interactions within synergy hub groups and redundant interactions between redundancy hubs groups would be high we calculated chance values of the % synergistic/ redundant interactions in randomized interaction networks.</s><s>To construct a randomized synergistic interaction matrix, we randomly assigned synergistic interactions between pairs while keeping the total number of synergistic interactions for each neuron constant.</s><s>Hence the identity of the hubs was retained even post randomization.</s><s>The percentage of synergistic interactions was then calculated for this randomized network.</s><s>A distribution of randomized values was calculated by repeating the randomization process multiple times (n = 500).</s><s>If the actual percentage exceeds the median of the randomized distribution (Wilcoxon signed rank test; p &lt; 0.05), then that session was used for the analysis, otherwise it was rejected.</s></p><p><s>Finally the distribution of values obtained for all sessions was tested against 50% using a Wilcoxon signed rank test to conclude whether the interaction percentage was significantly less than or greater than 50%.</s></p><p><s>Decoder analysis-We created sub-populations of different sizes with synergy and redundancy hubs for each session.</s><s>The size of the sub-population depended on the number of synergy and redundancy hubs found in that session.</s><s>For a fixed sub-population size, the number of synergy hubs and redundancy hubs was varied such that there were subpopulations with only redundancy hubs, only synergy hubs, or a mix of synergy and redundancy hubs in different proportions.</s><s>Thus, we created homogeneous and heterogeneous populations.</s><s>We explored all possible combinations of synergy and redundancy hubs for creating the heterogeneous sub-populations.</s><s>We decoded neural activity by using a multiclass linear discriminant analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Averbeck et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pesaran et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The classifier was trained on 70% of the trials and performance was tested on the remaining 30%.</s><s>We repeated this classification process 20 times with different training and testing sets drawn randomly from the trials from a session.</s><s>Decoder performance was averaged over all possible realizations of the sub-populations of a fixed size and over the number of iterations.</s></p><p><s>The responses used for decoding were spike counts in 300 ms bins and we employed the sliding window approach as described in the previous section to generate decoder accuracy as a function of time.</s><s>The maximum decoding accuracy above chance levels from this time course was used to quantify the decoding power of a sub-population.</s><s>Finally, to account for sub-populations with different number of neurons from different sessions, we calculated the normalized decoding accuracy which was obtained by dividing the decoder accuracy of a sub-population by the decoding accuracy of the homogeneous population containing only redundant hubs.</s></p></div>
