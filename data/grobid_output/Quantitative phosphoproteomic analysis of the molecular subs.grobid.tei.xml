proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies of whole brain lysates using multiplex tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1a</ref>).</s><s>A total of 4 proteomic and 13 phosphoproteomic experiments were performed (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1,</ref><ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>As a stringent internal quality control, the amount of peptides or phosphopeptides from skipped exon 13 of Sik3 Slp was specifically reduced by 40% in Sik3 Slp/+ relative to Sik3 +/+ samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4a</ref>).</s><s>In summary, proteomic analysis quantified 7,963 proteins, of which 5,280 are overlapped among the SD6/RS3 (5,769), SD6/S6 (6,067) and Slp/WT (7,650) groups (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4b-h</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Phosphoproteomic analysis quantified a total of 62,384 unique phosphopeptides from 7,104 phosphoproteins and identified 51,821 phosphorylation sites (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Few quantified peptides or proteins showed significant abundance changes (q &lt; 0.2) in the Slp/WT (0.09%; 3.5%), SD6/RS3 (0.01%; 0%) or SD6/S6 (0%; 0.01%) proteome comparisons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1d-f</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4g</ref>), suggesting a global stability of whole brain proteome (Supplementary Discussion 1).</s><s>In contrast, a sizable portion of phosphopeptides showed significant changes in the SD6/RS3 (12.4%),</s><s>SD6/S6 (4%) and Slp/WT (18.3%) phosphoproteome comparisons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1g-j</ref>).</s><s>In sleep-deprived brains, the majority of phosphorylation changes are increases (In): SD6/RS3 (3,551/4,293 = 82.7%)</s><s>or SD6/S6 (1,198/1,381 = 86.7%)</s><s>(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>The mean abundance of 918 phosphopeptides that are changed in both SD6/RS3 and SD6/S6 groups was, respectively, ~32% or ~25% lower in S6 or RS3 brains than in SD6 brains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1j,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>).</s><s>This asymmetric increase in phosphorylation was not observed in liver phosphoproteome after sleep deprivation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>Rather, most phosphorylation changes in the liver are decreases (De): SD6/S6 (1,275/2,186 = 58.3%)</s><s>and SD6/RS3 (286/433 = 66.1%) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>These studies suggest that sleep and wake promote opposite remodeling of brain phosphoproteome: prolonged wakefulness causes hyper-phosphoproteome, whereas sleep promotes global dephosphorylation of brain proteome.</s></p><p><s>Comparison of Sleepy and sleep-deprived models reveals 329 phosphopeptides that are significantly altered in all three (Slp/WT, SD6/S6, SD6/RS3) groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1j</ref>).</s><s>According to the mean abundance of each of 329 phosphopeptides, unsupervised cluster analysis indicates that Sleepy samples nicely cluster with SD6 samples, whereas wild-type samples cluster with S6 and RS3 samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1l</ref>).</s><s>We used phospho-site specific antibodies to validate hyper-phosphorylation of multiple proteins in both Sleepy and SD6 samples (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that Sleepy mutant brains exhibit a hyper-phosphoproteome mimicking sleep-deprived brains.</s></p><p><s>Protein functions can be switched on/off by site-specific phosphorylation, or modulated by cumulative phosphorylation of multiple sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> .</s><s>We noted a group of proteins containing multiple phosphorylation sites that seemed to be coordinately regulated in both models (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>For example, the synaptic vesicle protein Synapsin-1 contains multiple functionally important phosphorylation sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> , almost all of which are hyperphosphorylated in sleep-deprived and Sleepy brains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref>).</s><s>We devised a formula to measure overall phosphorylation state change (∆Ps) of Synapsin-1 by calculating the sum of log 2 (fold change) values of all significantly changed phosphopeptides.</s><s>Thus, Synapsin-1 exhibits a ∆Ps value of 7.5, 5.5 and 13.7 for the SD6/ RS3, SD6/S6 and Slp/WT comparisons, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2a</ref>).</s><s>Hyper-phosphorylation of Synapsin-1 in Sleepy and SD6 brain lysates was validated by phospho-tag gel electrophoresis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we performed global ∆Ps analysis for all quantified phosphoproteins in our datasets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2c</ref>-e and Supplementary
