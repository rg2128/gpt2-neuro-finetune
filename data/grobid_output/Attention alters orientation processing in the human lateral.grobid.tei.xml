Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Our pattern analysis results indicated that reliable orientation information was present not only in V1, but in the human LGN, as well (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>; all p's&lt;0.01).</s><s>Next, we asked whether the top-down effects of attentional feedback might influence orientation-selective responses in the LGN.</s><s>To do so, we measured the extent to which attention improved orientation classification performance, separately for oblique and cardinal orientations, based on the hypothesis that cortical feedback might selectively bolster the representation of oblique orientations in the LGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>We observed a significant interaction between the effects of attentional modulation, orientation, and visual area on classification performance, F(4,40) = 5.51, p = 0.001.</s><s>In V1, attention increased the strength of orientation responses for both oblique and cardinal orientations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, all p's &lt; .01) to a comparable extent, t(5) = 0.39, p = 0.71.</s><s>In the LGN, however, the attentional effect was significantly greater for oblique orientations than for cardinal orientations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>; t(5) = 4.76, p = 0.002).</s><s>Specifically, the withdrawal of attentional feedback led to substantially weaker orientation-selective activity patterns for oblique orientations in the LGN, but had no reliable effect on cardinal orientations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>The qualitatively different pattern of results observed in the LGN and V1 suggests that a distinct type of featureselective modulation is occurring in the LGN, leading to the selective enhancement of oblique orientations (Supplementary Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Do these attentional effects reflect changes in the pattern-specific component of these orientation responses, or might they reflect gross changes in mean BOLD activity?</s><s>We compared the overall magnitude of the BOLD response for cardinal and oblique orientations.</s><s>Attention led to enhanced responses in both the LGN and V1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, F(4,40) = 20.19,</s><s>p &lt; .001),</s><s>but the magnitude of modulation was comparable for cardinal and oblique orientations in the LGN and V1, with no evidence of an interaction effect, F(4,40) = 0.38, p = .56.</s><s>Taken together, our results indicate that attention enhances the overall BOLD response of the LGN regardless of stimulus orientation, but that the impact of attentional feedback on feature selectivity is more nuanced: the degree to which attention affects LGN processing of a visual stimulus depends on stimulus orientation.</s></p><p><s>The amount of orientation information we observed in LGN activity patterns was modest, when compared to the high classification performance of area V1.</s><s>This was to be expected due to several factors, including broader orientation selectivity of LGN neurons, poorer quality of fMRI signals from subcortical than cortical regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , and the relatively smaller size of the LGN structure.</s><s>Nevertheless, we observe reliable orientation-selective responses in the human LGN, and these may arise from several sources.</s><s>For example, animal studies have suggested that ganglion cell receptive fields are not uniformly circular <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , but instead exhibit modest orientation preferences organized at both fine <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and coarse spatial scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>To determine whether one such coarse-scale orientation bias, known as the radial bias, exists in the human LGN, we conducted an additional experiment to examine whether LGN responses depend on the correspondence between stimulus orientation and retinotopic preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>LGN voxels were localized based on their retinotopic preference for either of the two diagonal radial axes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), and mean BOLD responses were significantly greater for full-field gratings that were collinear rather than orthogonal to a voxel's preferred radial axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, LGN: t(3) = 6.649, p = .003;</s><s>V1: t(3) = 7.536; p = .</s><s>002).</s><s>These results indicate that the human LGN exhibits a coarse-scale preference for radial orientations, similar to what has been previously found in the human V1.</s><s>In another experiment, we found that that the orientation of logarithmic spiral gratings could also be decoded from LGN activity patterns, indicating the presence of other sources of orientation preference in human LGN, distinct from radial bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In a final experiment, we used univariate fMRI analyses to test whether the LGN is sensitive to orientation-tuned masking.</s><s>By combining target and mask images that have collinear or orthogonal orientations, one can test for nonlinear orientation-selective responses to the linearly summed image pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>We found that BOLD responses in the LGN and V1 exhibit a predicted dependence on orientation: responses were weaker when target and mask were collinear rather than orthogonal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure">d,</ref> LGN: t(3) = 7.44, p = .002;</s><s>V1: t(3) = 4.11; p = .013).</s><s>These differential responses could not result from LGN detectors that lacked orientation tuning, providing further evidence that orientation responses are present in the human LGN (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Recent studies demonstrate that top-down attention can impact the neural responsivity of the LGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , but we are in the nascent stages of understanding of how it might affect featureselective processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Our study provides converging evidence, using both multivariate and univariate fMRI approaches, for orientation-selective responses in the human LGN.</s><s>These orientation-selective responses exhibit some degree of coarse organization coincident with retinotopic preference, and they appear to exhibit orientation-dependent interactions.</s><s>Taken together, these results suggest that the LGN may play an underappreciated role in processing orientation information, a process that has traditionally been attributed to the visual cortex.</s><s>Moreover, we found that attention altered these orientation-selective responses suggesting a remarkably early locus by which top-down processes act upon feature-selective responses.</s><s>Even modest levels of attentional modulation at this stage could potentially lead to larger effects downstream, suggesting that this early modulation may have an important role in visual perception.</s></p></div>

Orientation-Tuned Masking experiments, BOLD responses were estimated per condition by fitting the time series with a GLM.</s><s>However, in these experiments there were epochs of blank fixation (12 s)
