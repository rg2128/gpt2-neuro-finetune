<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this paper we have investigated the dimensionality of the neural activity in the gustatory cortex of alert rats.</s><s>Dimensionality was defined as a collective property of ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons that reflects the effective space occupied by the ensemble activity during either ongoing or evoked activity.</s><s>If one represents ensemble activity in terms of firing rate vectors, whose dimension is the number of ensemble neurons N, then the collection of rate vectors across trials takes the form of a set of points in the N-dimensional space of firing rates.</s><s>Roughly, dimensionality is the minimal number of dimensions necessary to provide an accurate description of such set of points, which may be localized on a lower-dimensional subspace inside the whole firing rate space.</s></p><p><s>One of the main results of this paper is that the dimensionality of evoked activity is smaller than that of ongoing activity, i.e., stimulus presentation quenches dimensionality.</s><s>More specifically, the dimensionality is linearly related to the ensemble size, with a significantly larger slope during ongoing activity compared to evoked activity (compare Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>We explained this phenomenon using a biologically plausible, mechanistic spiking network model based on recurrent connectivity with clustered architecture.</s><s>The model was recently introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mazzucato et al. (2015)</ref> to account for the observed dynamics of ensembles of GC neurons as sequences of metastable states, where each state is defined as a vector of firing rates across simultaneously recorded neurons.</s><s>The model captures the reduction in trial-to-trial variability and the multiple firing rates attained by single neurons across different states observed in GC upon stimulus presentation.</s><s>Here, the same model was found to capture also the stimulus-induced reduction of dimensionality.</s><s>While the set of active clusters during ongoing activity varies randomly, allowing the ensemble dynamics to explore a large portion of firing rate space, the evoked set of active clusters is limited mostly to the stimulusselective clusters only (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mazzucato et al., 2015</ref> for a detailed analysis).</s><s>The dynamics of cluster activation in the model thus explains the more pronounced dependence of dimensionality on ensemble size found during ongoing compared to evoked activity.</s></p><p><s>We presented a simple theory of how dimensionality depends on the number of simultaneously recorded neurons N, their firing rate correlations, their variance, and the number and duration of recording trials.</s><s>We found that dimensionality increases with N and decreases with the amount of pair-wise correlations among the neurons (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8C</ref>).</s><s>At parity of correlations, dimensionality is maximal when all neurons have the same firing rate variance, and it decreases as the distribution of count variances becomes more heterogeneous (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8B</ref>).</s><s>The estimation of dimensionality based on a finite dataset is an increasing function of the number of trials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8A</ref>).</s><s>Finally, introducing clustered correlations in the theory, and sampling one neuron per cluster as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9B</ref>, results in cusps at values of N that are multiples of the number of clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9D</ref>), in agreement with the predictions of the spiking network model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9A</ref>, full lines).</s></p></div>
