<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Volunteers and Drinks</head><p><s>All volunteers were Burkinabe adult males aged between 20 and 43 years in good health and not using any medication.</s><s>On the day of experiment the participants were asked not to smoke, drink alcohol or use deodorants.</s><s>A total of 43 participants were randomly assigned to the beer (n = 25 volunteers) or the water groups (n = 18 volunteers).</s></p><p><s>The beverage used in this experiment is a local beer called dolo with low alcohol content (,3%) and prepared from fermented dough of sorghum.</s><s>Dolo is the most commonly consumed alcoholic beverage in Burkina Faso with 40% of the total sorghum grain production used for its preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36]</ref>.</s><s>Dolo is predominantly consumed by males during the evening at specific production sites called ''cabarets''.</s><s>For our experiment, we bought the dolo from two different production sites in the district of Dioulassoba (Bobo-Dioulasso) between one to two hours before the start of the experiment.</s><s>Participants from the water group drank potable tap water from Bobo-Dioulasso.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mosquitoes</head><p><s>Experiments were conducted using the F 1 progeny of fieldcollected gravid An. gambiae from villages of the Kou Valley, located 30 km north of Bobo-Dioulasso in south-western Burkina Faso <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>.</s><s>In this area, the An.</s><s>gambiae complex is composed almost exclusively of An. gambiae s.s. with the M molecular form predominating <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38]</ref>.</s><s>The mosquitoes were reared at 25uC in the insectary of the Institut de Recherches en Sciences de la Sante (IRSS) in Bobo-Dioulasso <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Groups of 50 adult female mosquitoes (3 to 4-day old) without prior access to a blood meal were randomly collected from the rearing cages 6-8 h before the start of the experiments, and placed in paper cups covered by a gauze <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Beer consumption, as opposed to water consumption, significantly increased both the activation and orientation of An. gambiae.</s><s>Beer consumption ('After Beer' (AB) treatment) activated significantly more of the mosquitoes (47%, GLMM; Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.63; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = [1.41,</s><s>1.89]; P,0.001) than the three other treatments, 'Before Beer' (BB, 35%), 'Before Water' (BW, 37%) and 'After Water' (AW, 38%) (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>The proportion of activated mosquitoes retrieved from the volunteers' odour-baited trap was 50, 53 and 47% for the treatments BB, BW and AW respectively, indicating that mosquitoes did not orientate preferentially towards human odours relative to outdoor air (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, 65% of the An.</s><s>gambiae flying upwind, orientated toward the odour trap after the volunteers consumed beer, indicating a significant increase in orientation following beer consumption (OR = 1.77;</s><s>CI = [1.36,</s><s>2.30]; P,0.001; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Axillary temperature decreased slightly after alcohol consumption (starting mean 6 SE = 36.360.09</s><s>Cu to 36.160.08 Cu; paired t-test, t = 3.2, df = 23, P = 0.004) and water consumption found before and after beer (582637 ppm and 568638 ppm) or water consumptions (563638 ppm and 589642 ppm).</s><s>The level of CO 2 exhaled by volunteers in the Y-olfactometer had no effect on mosquito activation (OR = 1; CI = [0.99,</s><s>1.1]; P = 0.9), but higher levels of exhaled CO 2 were associated with a lower degree of orientation (OR = 0.998; CI = [0.997,</s><s>0.999]; P,0.001).</s><s>These Activation and orientation varied with the volunteer tested (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>There was no relationship between activation and orientation (before drink consumption: r 2 = 20.016,</s><s>P = 0.56; and after dolo consumption: r 2 = 0.07, P = 0.11; or after water consumption: r 2 = 20.05,</s><s>P = 0.7).</s><s>Volunteers that induced high mosquito activation did not systematically induce high mosquito orientation.</s></p><p><s>Individual volunteers' odours affected mosquito behaviour consistently across trials (activation: r 2 = 0.31, P,0.001, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>; orientation: r 2 = 0.37, P,0.001, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>Volunteers that induced high activation or orientation before drinking also induced high activation or orientation after drinking.</s></p><p><s>Overall, our findings indicate that, despite the individual differences of volunteers, beer consumption consistently increased volunteers' attractiveness to mosquitoes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We explored the effect of beer consumption on human attractiveness to a natural population of An. gambiae using a Y-olfactometer designed to accommodate total body emanations as a source of odour stimuli.</s><s>We found that beer consumption not only enhanced the number of mosquitoes that engage in odourmediated upwind flight (mosquito activation) but also enhanced the strength of their odour-mediated anemotactic response (mosquito orientation).</s><s>Mosquito activation and orientation are important parts of the natural host-seeking process of An. gambiae and any increases in these behaviours will facilitate vector-human contacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref>.</s><s>Water consumption did not affect these mosquito behavioural responses, demonstrating that beer was solely responsible for increased human attractiveness.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that beer consumption increases human attractiveness to An. gambiae, which is the principal vector of malaria in Africa.</s></p><p><s>The proximate reasons for why people are more attractive after beer consumption are currently unclear.</s><s>The increased attractiveness of pregnant women has been attributed to increased body temperatures and exhaled breath <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Here, higher body temperatures were not associated with higher attractiveness and beer consumption actually resulted in decreased body temperatures.</s><s>Our results also indicate that increased exhaled breath cannot account for the observed increase in human attractiveness following beer consumption.</s><s>Higher levels of exhaled breath (as measured with a CO 2 analyser) were not associated with higher attractiveness and beer consumption did not affect CO 2 expiration rate.</s><s>We postulate that the metabolism of alcohol following beer consumption induces changes in breath and odour markers (i.e.</s><s>increases the production of kairomones such as 1-octen-3-ol) that increases attractiveness to An. gambiae.</s><s>Beyond this coincidental side effect of beer consumption, mosquitoes may have evolved preferences for people who recently consumed beer -possibly due to reduced host defensive behaviours or highly nutritious blood-meals.</s><s>This hypothesis is appealing but requires further investigations.</s></p><p><s>Although beer consumption significantly increased the volunteer attractiveness relative to the outdoor air control (mosquito orientation), the absence of orientational bias toward volunteer odours in the three other treatments (BB, BW and AW) is intriguing.</s><s>Similar results have been recently obtained using the same methodology and mosquito population <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</s><s>In field situations, odour-mediated anemotaxis is an effective strategy to locate a vertebrate.</s><s>Upon arrival in the vicinity of the host, additional cues such as warm, moist convective currents and host movement are exploited by the insect to orientate toward the host.</s><s>Therefore, the absence of orientational bias for the volunteer odour-baited trap may have stemmed from the fact that our bioassay removes some of these host-related short-range stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Unsurprisingly An. gambiae activation increased over the evening (17:00 to 21:30).</s><s>Like most anopheline species, An. gambiae is a night biter.</s><s>In this species, the biting cycle starts at sunset and rises to peak between 24:00 and 1:00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the positive relationship between mosquito activation and time simply reflects the natural circadian flight activity, the process by which hungry females of An. gambiae engage in non-oriented flight to optimise their chance of encountering host stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Upon contact with odour stimuli, An. gambiae then switches from this appetitive search to the actual host location behaviours.</s></p><p><s>We found that higher levels of expired CO 2 were associated with lower mosquito orientation.</s><s>This result is in apparent contradiction with the general acceptance that blood-feeding insects are attracted to carbon dioxide.</s><s>Despite thorough investigations, the role of CO 2 in host-finding by An. gambiae mosquitoes remains equivocal <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>At least three lines of arguments can be advanced to resolve this apparent contradiction.</s><s>First, it is increasingly recognized that while CO 2 , a compound exhaled by all mammals, induces mosquito activation, it does not provide accurate orientational cues to the anthropophilic An. gambiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref>.</s><s>Second, compounds which are termed attractants can also act as repellents at high concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>.</s><s>In natural conditions, human exhalations are dispersed and strongly diluted before contacting host-seeking mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, the CO 2 concentration released in the volunteer trap (575 ppm on average) may have been too strong, resulting in a negative effect on mosquito orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the fine-scale structure of the CO 2 plume (continuous vs. pulsed stream) is known to affect the orientation, with a continuous plume reducing the behavioural responses of mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46]</ref>.</s><s>We do not know the structure of the CO 2 plume in this bioassay.</s></p><p><s>Alcohol consumption is a widespread phenomenon throughout the world and represents one of the most pressing global health priorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>.</s><s>The alcoholic beverage used in this experiment is a very popular drink in West Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the increased attractiveness following beer consumption found here raises crucial issues regarding strategic planning for malaria control.</s><s>Recent models have stressed that local malaria control can only be reached if people who are bitten the most can be identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</s><s>By ascertaining beer consumption as a risk factor, our study has identified a potential underlying cause of heterogeneous biting, and hence provides insights into the feasibility of targeted interventions.</s></p><p><s>The outlook may be even worse if we consider that alcohol contributes substantially to the global burden of diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>, especially by compromising the host immune defence against parasites.</s><s>Numerous studies have demonstrated that moderate and chronic alcohol consumptions can have strong immunosuppressive effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, people who drink beer are not only at higher risk of exposure to malaria mosquitoes but could also be more
