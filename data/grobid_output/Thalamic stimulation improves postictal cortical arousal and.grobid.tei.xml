2002)</ref> and is hypothesized to support synchronization and effort regulation in neural networks that underlie cognitive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jones, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It has long been postulated that the thalamus works as a major network hub in ictal and postictal states of impaired consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Penfield, 1936)</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies in chronically implanted animals demonstrated that CL stimulation induced cortical desynchronization in LFP recordings during the postictal state after secondarily generalized seizures <ref type="bibr">(Gummadavelli et al., 2015a)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, Kundishora et al. found that dual-site stimulation of the CL and pontine nucleus oralis (PnO) bilaterally restored an awake-appearing cortical physiological state and improved behavioral arousal during the ictal period in focal seizures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kundishora et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>These studies emphasize the important role of CL in maintaining consciousness.</s><s>However, consciousness level in these studies was evaluated based on simple observation of resumed exploratory behavior and movement in rats.</s><s>Evaluation of task performance requiring purposeful behavior was needed beyond these more basic previous behavioral observations to further explore the efficacy and safety of CL stimulation during the postictal period.</s><s>The present study focused on evaluation of task performance based on purposeful behaviors in the postictal period after secondarily generalized seizures.</s><s>Because this is a state in which patients are typically profoundly impaired this work has important clinical relevance.</s></p><p><s>Focal seizures also often impair consciousness ictally and postictally, although to a lesser extent than generalized seizures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(McPherson et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Focal seizures should be investigated with purposeful behavioral tasks as well in future work with rodent models.</s><s>In addition, to further investigate potential side effects and benefits in a model more closely resembling treatment of epilepsy patients, the effects of CL stimulation following closed-loop seizure detection in spontaneous seizure rodent models should also be done.</s><s>Another subject for further investigation is potential direct effects of CL stimulation on seizure severity.</s><s>In our experiments with the sucrose reward task, CL stimulation began immediately with seizure onset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), thus fully overlapping the seizure period.</s><s>We did not see a significant difference in seizure duration or amplitude (based on delta power; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>) during the ictal period, suggesting the effects of CL stimulation was not simply to reduce seizure severity.</s><s>In addition, we did see benefits of CL stimulation even when it was delivered fully in the postictal period with no overlap of the seizure time period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>), producing improvements in both postictal physiology and behavior on the E/A task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Nevertheless, additional studies of possible direct effects of CL stimulation on seizure severity would be valuable.</s></p><p><s>In the current study, rats in the group that received CL stimulation showed modest improvement in performance during the postictal period in the sucrose reward task and marked improvement on the E/A task.</s><s>Interestingly, in the sucrose reward task, electrophysiological improvement (decreased delta-wave power) was obvious during the postictal DBS period; however, significant behavioral improvement (increased licking rate) was observed only at later times even after DBS had ended.</s><s>In other words, the behavioral licking response seemed to lag behind the electrophysiologic changes.</s><s>These findings suggest that during the postictal period, when DBS abolished cortical slow waves, other factors aside from cortical arousal might have contributed to the persistently reduced spontaneous licking responses.</s><s>In contrast, with the shock E/A task postictal thalamic CL DBS dramatically improved lever-press responses.</s><s>Of note, the sucrose reward task we developed was a positive reinforcement type task; rats received no punishment if they did not lick and received rewards when they did.</s><s>Thus, we can speculate that the motivation to perform in this task was less than in the E/A task, where failing to perform led to a negative consequence.</s><s>In addition, the absence of an auditory stimulus as a cue to signal sucrose availability would require more internal motivation for rats to initiate performance compared with the E/A task where an auditory warning signaled incipient arrival of the aversive shock.</s><s>Compared with the sucrose reward task, the E/A task we developed was a negative reinforcement type task.</s><s>The rats received an aversive stimulus in the form of an electrical shock if they failed to push the lever after the auditory signal.</s><s>Our results demonstrated that avoidance percentage for the rats that received CL DBS was significantly higher and response times significantly shorter when compared with the sham group.</s><s>Importantly, these findings suggest that thalamic CL neurostimulation could have a potential therapeutic benefit in promoting self-preservation and thus improving the safety of patients with epilepsy in the postictal period.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have developed two behavioral tasks that allowed us to characterize the postictal state in a rodent model of secondarily generalized limbic seizures.</s><s>CL DBS decreased cortical slow wave activity and improved task performance in the postictal period, particularly in the E/A task.</s><s>Because preclinical task performance studies are crucial to explore the effectiveness and safety of DBS treatment, our work is clinically relevant as it could support and help set the foundations for human neurostimulation trials (https://braininitiative.nih.gov/funded-awards/</s><s>thalamic-stimulation-prevent-impaired-consciousness-epilepsy).</s><s>In particular, therapeutic benefits of DBS during the ictal period could be substantially augmented by improved responsiveness in the postictal period in patients with medically and surgically refractory epilepsy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
