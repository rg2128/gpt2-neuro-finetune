Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the mean ROC values for these cells as a function of bar length for the control and the mecamylamine-applied condition.</s><s>A twofactor ANOVA did not show significant effects of drug application (F 1,744 = 0.54, P = 0.465), whereas there was a significant effect of bar length (F 6,744 = 2.98, P = 0.0069) on the size of the ROC values.</s><s>There was no interaction between mecamylamine applied/notapplied and bar length (F 6,744 = 0.40, P = 0.881).</s><s>These findings were consistent for the two animals.</s><s>The same outcome was true when the modulation index was used to quantify the effects of mecamylamine application on attentional modulation (F 1,744 = 1.41,</s><s>P = 0.236, two-factor ANOVA).</s></p><p><s>None of the effects of ACh, scopolamine or mecamylamine were due to differences in eye position induced by drug application (see Supplementary Methods).</s></p><p><s>For the neuromodulator dopamine it has been reported that only an optimal dose benefits neuronal and behavioural performance19, whereby too much and too little dopamine is detrimental for cognitive performance.</s><s>We found evidence for a similar pattern of results for ACh in V1: that is, only small doses of extra ACh increased attentional modulation (for details, see Supplementary Methods).</s></p><p><s>Systemic applications of cholinergic drugs or large injections into higher cortical areas have been shown to affect performance in humans20 and macaque monkeys21.</s><s>The highly local character of iontophoretic drug application used in our study made it unlikely that performance would be affected, as even systemic infusions result in relatively small changes to reaction times20.</s><s>In line with this expectation, neither scopolamine nor mecamylamine application affected reaction times significantly.</s><s>However, when ACh was applied we found a significant interaction between drug application and the locus of attention on reaction times (F 1,31827 = 4.56, P = 0.038, three-factor ANOVA).</s><s>ACh increased reaction times in the attend-away condition and decreased reaction times in the attend-receptive-field condition.</s><s>This effect was significant across the three monkeys, but only individually in monkey HO (F 1,5588 = 4.77, P = 0.029, three-factor ANOVA).</s><s>Similar trends were found in monkey HU and monkey B, but they did not reach significance (interaction between ACh application and locus of attention on reaction times: monkey HU, F 1,20334 = 3.03, P = 0.081; monkey B, F 1,5905 = 3.06, P = 0.080).</s><s>These results indicate that ACh boosts aspects of attention when the animals attend to the stimulus in the receptive field, thus decreasing reaction times.</s><s>The increase in reaction times in the attend-away condition could be due to improved neuronal processing at the application site making it more difficult to disengage attention from the irrelevant location, thus slightly increasing reaction times (for more information, see Supplementary Methods).</s></p><p><s>We found that ACh contributes to attentional modulation in V1, of the macaque monkey through muscarinic, but not nicotinic, receptor mechanisms.</s><s>Fewer excitatory cells compared to inhibitory cells are subject to muscarinic modulation in V1 (ref.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>, raising the possibility that our recordings were mostly from inhibitory neurons.</s><s>Analysis of the 'spike' waveform, however, suggests that recordings were mostly from excitatory neurons.</s><s>Thus, the effects may have been mediated through local cortical circuitry, perhaps through an effect on the sort of oscillatory activity that has been linked to attentional effects23.</s><s>Alternatively, the fact that attentional effects are stronger in V2 and V4 (ref.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>, where there are also more muscarinic receptors22 on excitatory cells, suggests that the effects may have been more direct and not necessarily mediated by changes in the overall network state.</s><s>Nicotinic receptors in macaque V1 are mostly located presynaptically on thalamocortical terminals in layer 4C, where they affect the neuronal gain25.</s><s>Although attention affects firing rates in simple cells of V1 (ref.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>, where nicotinic receptors would be expected to have the most direct effect25, our result indicates that this is not mediated at the thalamocortical synaptic input stage.</s><s>Although we found no evidence of nicotinic receptor contribution to attentional modulation in V1 it is probable that they contribute to attentional modulation in higher areas27, perhaps through the feed-forward cortico-cortical pathway.</s></p><p><s>An important question for neuromodulatory accounts of attention28 is reconciling the highly localized and fast effects of spatial attention with the apparent (though perhaps arguable29) coarseness of the ACh innervation.</s><s>One possibility is that an interaction between ACh and glutamatergic feedback mediates attentional processing in sensory areas.</s><s>Increased amounts of ACh alter the strengths of the connections in V1 and the biophysical state of sensory neurons which may then allow spatially specific glutamatergic feedback to enhance specific incoming information.</s><s>Other possible sources of highly localized cholinergic contribution to attentional modulation are the recently described cholinergic cortical interneurons30.</s><s>Future studies will be necessary to clarify these issues.</s><s>Nevertheless, the first step in understanding attentional modulation is to unpick its cortical determinants; our findings directly address this.</s></p></div>
