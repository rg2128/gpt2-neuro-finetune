when cholinergic inputs to the olfactory system were decreased <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Devore et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>These results are in agreement with data from other systems, such as hippocampus and sensory cortex, where encoding of overlapping or ambiguous information is enhanced by cholinergic modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baxter and Chiba, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">De Rosa et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ljubojevic et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Experiments from our and other labs have shown that cholinergic modulation in the olfactory bulb regulates the similarity between odor representations, and that this regulation is specifically important during encoding but not recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Linster et

computationally that a feedback loop between olfactory cortex and the nucleus providing cholinergic input to the olfactory bulb and cortex, the HDB, allows the olfactory system to compare an odor stimulation to previously encoded odors and dynamically regulate if an odor will be encoded or not.</s><s>The model presented relies on a projection, direct or indirect, between olfactory cortical pyramidal cells and HDB GABAergic interneurons.</s><s>While such a connection has not been demonstrated, it has been shown that electrical stimulation of olfactory cortex can modulate neural activity in the HDB at a precise and short latency <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Linster and Hasselmo, 2000)</ref>, at least not excluding the possibility of such a projection.</s><s>As a consequence, the possibility of feedback regulation exists in this system.</s><s>Consequences of our proposed feedback loop are: (1) a relatively high spontaneous activity in cholinergic neurons in the HDB in the absence of odor stimulation, (2) a decrease in cholinergic neuron activity as an odor becomes increasingly familiar, accompanied by an increase in GABAergic activity in the HDB and (3) an increase in cortical pyramidal cell activity in response to increasingly familiar odorants.</s><s>Our accompanying recordings from a small number of HDB neurons in a simple odor reward association task show that a small percentage of neurons each decreased or increased their firing rate significantly below or above their spontaneous rate over the course of sampling a same odor repeatedly.</s><s>When presented with a second, novel odor, these neurons first return to their initial firing rate and then either decrease or increase their firing rates similarly as in response to the first odor.</s><s>The return to baseline response levels upon initial presentation of the novel odor shows that the increase of decrease of activity is not merely a temporal phenomenon but depends on odor familiarity.</s><s>Despite the small number of neurons recorded, the data are consistent in that all neurons clearly fell into three categories and hence we think can be representative for the behavior of HDB neurons in general for the particular behavioral task implemented here.</s><s>While it is not possible to categorize GABAergic and cholinergic neurons from these recordings it cannot be excluded that populations of HDB neurons (GABAergic, cholinergic or glutamatergic) could correspond to the separate responses in this particular task.</s><s>Overall, these recordings are in agreement with the predictions from our computational model as presented here; however the data presented is not exclusively compatible with the theoretical ideas presented here but could result from a number of different scenarios.</s><s>For example, internal synaptic connections between HDB neurons, as evidence by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Yang et al. (2014)</ref> could result in differential activities of HDB neurons as observed here.</s></p><p><s>Our simulations show that cortical learning could modulate olfactory bulb odor representations by modulating the degree of cholinergic inputs.</s><s>As a consequence, encoded OB odor representations are sparse and synchronous, with high signal to noise ratio.</s><s>As we have shown before <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(de Almeida et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Devore et al., 2014)</ref>, cholinergic modulation of OB processing enhances cortical learning and stability and duration of cortical representations.</s><s>In the context presented here, cholinergic input to the OB is not strictly necessary for the regulation of learning to occur but enhances the specificity of the learned odor representation.</s><s>In our simulations, the size of the cortical attractor decides if an odor is considered familiar or novel.</s><s>Together with previous experimental and computational work from olfactory and other systems, our results strongly suggest the existence of a feedback loop between sensory representations and learning, mediated by cholinergic projections.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>v hyper = -10 mV; t refrac = 2 ms* Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) τ = 5 ms; β = 1; θ min = 0 mV; θ max = 15 ms; β = 2; θ min = -1 mV; θ max = 7 mV|3 mV † Periglomerular (PG) τ = 2 ms; β = 1; θ min = 0 mV; θ max = 10 mV|5 mV † Granule (Gr) τ = 5 ms; β = 2; θ min = -0.3</s><s>mV; θ max = 9.5 mV|7 mV † Feedforward (Ff) τ = 5 ms; β = 1; θ min = -0.3</s><s>mV; θ max = 15 mV Pyramidal (Pyr) τ = 10 ms; β = 2; θ min = 0 mV; θ max = 15 mV Feedback (Fb) τ = 5 ms; β = 2; θ min = -0.03</s><s>mV|-0.13</s><s>mV † ; θ max = 15 mV Gabaergic (Gb) τ = 5 ms; β = 3; θ min = 0 mV; θ max = 15 mV Cholinergic (Ac) τ = 10 ms; β = 1; θ min = -0.5 mV; θ max = 15 mV OSN to PG g max = 0.166; E N = +70 mV; τ 1 = 1 ms; τ 2 = 2 ms OSN to Mi (apical) g max = 0.35; E N = +70 mV; τ 1 = 1 ms; τ 2 = 2 ms PG to Mi (apical) g max = 0.38; E N = -10 mV; τ 1 = 4 ms; τ 2 = 8 ms Mi (soma) to Gr g max = 0.09; E N = +70 mV; τ 1 = 1 ms; τ 2 = 2 ms Gr to Mi (soma) g max = 0.18; E N = -10 mV; τ 1 = 4 ms; τ 2 = 8 ms Mi (soma) to Ff g max = 0.2; E N = -10 mV; τ 1 = 4 ms; τ 2 = 8 ms Mi (soma) to Pyr g max = 0.76; E N = +70 mV; τ 1 = 1 ms; τ 2 = 2 ms Ff to Pyr g max = 0.055; E N = -10 mV; τ 1 = 4 ms; τ 2 = 8 ms Pyr to Fb g max = 0.25; E N = +70 mV; τ 1 = 1 ms; τ 2 = 2 ms Fb to Pyr g max = 0.55|0.28</s><s>† ; E N = -10 mV; τ 1 = 4 ms; τ 2 = 8 ms Pyr to Pyr (association fibers) g max = 650|300 † ; E N = +70 mV; τ 1 = 1 ms; τ 2 = 2 ms Pyr to Gb g max = 0.085; E N = +70 mV; τ 1 = 1 ms; τ 2 = 2 ms Gb to Ac g max = 0.12; E N = -10 mV; τ 1 = 4 ms; τ 2 = 8 ms Pyr adaptation A ahc = 10|0*; E N = -15 mV; τ ahc = 100 ms *Spiking neurons; † different values are without|with cholinergic modulation, respectively;</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
