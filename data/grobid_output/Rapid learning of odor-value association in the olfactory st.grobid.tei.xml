<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Animals (general).</s><s>All experimental animals of either sex were C57BL/6 mice obtained from the Charles River Laboratories and were 2-4 months of age at the start of the experiments.</s><s>Following surgical implantation of a tetrode drive and a custom head plate, all mice we rehoused individually.</s><s>Experiments were conducted in accordance with Harvard University Animal Care Guidelines.</s></p><p><s>Surgery.</s><s>Surgeries were performed on naive animals, and all behavioral training began after recovery from surgery.</s><s>Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ketamine (80 mg/kg).</s><s>To access sniffing information, airflow was measured through a cannula implanted in the nasal canal.</s><s>A craniotomy (;1 mm) was made over the nasal canal (2 mm anterior of nasal/frontal fissure, 1 mm lateral) on the skull, with a goal of implanting a nasal cannula to monitor sniffing during behavioral and physiological experiments.</s><s>An 18 gauge stainless steel cannula (;5 mm in length) was inserted into the craniotomy.</s><s>To affix the cannula to the skull, superglue was used for initial placement followed by two applications of dental cement to ensure stability of the cannula.</s><s>Additionally, a craniotomy (;1 mm) was made over the dorsal skull at a location directly above the areas targeted for electrophysiological recordings with the goal of implanting a tetrode bundle (six tetrodes plus a 200-mm-diameter optic fiber to ensure stability).</s><s>The target locations were as follows: pPC (coordinates: 0.5 mm posterior and 3.8 mm lateral from bregma, and 3.8 mm ventral from brain surface) and OT (coordinates: 1.2 mm anterior and 1.5-2 mm lateral from bregma, and 4.6 mm ventral from brain surface).</s><s>To ensure stability of the head of the animal during behavior and recording at a later stage, a custom-made head plate (made of light-weight titanium; dimensions, 30 Â 10 Â 1 mm; weight, 0.8 g) was affixed to the skull.</s><s>A shallow well was drilled over the posterior lateral skull, and a single skull screw was affixed at that location.</s><s>A wire was attached to this skull for grounding electrophysiological recordings.</s><s>At the end of the surgery, a removable plastic cap was placed on the top of the nasal cannula to prevent foreign objects from entering the cannula.</s><s>In addition, a plastic cone was positioned around the tetrode drive, and capped with a removable lid, to prevent damage to the drive.</s><s>The nasal cannula and tetrode drive were implanted during the same surgery, but always on opposite (i.e., contralateral) sides.</s><s>Each lateral olfactory tract delivers sensory input from a single olfactory bulb to the ipsilateral pPC and OT.</s><s>Implanting the nasal cannula and tetrode drive on opposite sides was intended to avoid altering the natural airflow to the relevant sensory neurons for our recordings.</s><s>Following the completion of the surgery, mice were given 1 week to recover.</s></p><p><s>Odor stimulus delivery.</s><s>A custom-made 16-odor olfactometer was used to deliver stimuli during behavioral tasks.</s><s>The olfactometer had a carrier stream of air calibrated to flow at 1 L/min.</s><s>A single odor at a time could be added onto this carrier stream by opening an odor-specific valve to permit airflow (at 0.1 L/min) from an input manifold, through a tube containing liquid-phase odorant, and finally into the carrier stream.</s><s>One-way check valves prevented the flow of odor from odorant-containing tubes into the carrier stream or back into the input manifold when air was not actively being flowed.</s><s>Odor delivery to the animal was gated by a single ("final") valve that directed odor to the animal or, between odor presentations, to an exhaust system.</s><s>Note that this single valve was common to all odors and thus was not informative about odor identity.</s><s>When odor was not flowed to the animal, a stream of clean air of the same flow rate was directed to the animal.</s><s>This ensured active clearing of odors between trials.</s><s>In addition, an exhaust system cleared odors from the behavior chamber.</s><s>To ensure immediate delivery of odors, and comparable odor concentration from trial to trial, the line to the final valve was primed with odor from the current trial beginning at the end of the previous trial (i.e., minimum of 5 s, sufficient to replace the line volume three to five times).</s><s>Sound from the switching of an odor-specific valve to perform selection of an odor for the upcoming trial was masked by a substantially louder non-odor-specific valve turned on simultaneously.</s><s>The valves corresponding to each odor were randomly switched occasionally between sessions to prevent animals from learning sound cues, rather than odor cues.</s><s>Finally, all tubing that was odor specific was replaced at the same time as new odors were added to the olfactometer to prevent odor from previous sessions lingering and being used as cues for task performance.</s></p><p><s>Behavioral task.</s><s>When animals fully recovered from surgery (;7 d), they were placed on a water deprivation schedule for behavioral conditioning.</s><s>Animals were first acclimated to head restraint (with their implanted head plate held in place) on the behavior rig over the course of 3-5 d.</s><s>Then, animals were trained to lick for water from a spout positioned 2-3 mm from the mouth until satiated (typically, 1-1.5 ml); licking this spout (or not licking) would subsequently serve as the response for all behavioral tasks (Go/No-Go).</s><s>Lick training took ;2-4 additional days.</s><s>Next, odors were presented for 1 s with a varying (3 s minimum plus an exponential distribution with mean of 5 additional seconds) interstimulus interval, and reward was only available for a subset (half) of these odors.</s><s>At first, only two odors (one rewarded, one unrewarded) were presented to expedite learning.</s><s>The number of odors was increased to four and then eight (i.e., full task odor panel).</s><s>Initially, water reward would be available immediately on licking during odor presentation.</s><s>Gradually, the delay between lick/odor presentation and reward delivery was increased until reward delivery occurred at least 500 ms after the conclusion of odor presentation.</s><s>To discourage a high false alarm rate, a hit was scored only on trials that the mouse licked in at least three of four 350 ms bins, beginning at the time of odor onset.</s><s>It follows that mice were required to make a decision before the end of the second bin, 700 ms into the odor presentation, but this did not seem to force early inaccurate decisions.</s></p><p><s>Neural recordings began once the animals reach strong performance (.90% correct) on the full eight-odor panel.</s><s>No odors were replaced during this initial period to facilitate the acquisition of task structure.</s><s>In the final stage of experiments, a subset of odors was replaced between some sessions to study the learning of novel odorreward associations.</s></p><p><s>Respiration monitoring.</s><s>Respiration was recorded through a nasal cannula implanted during surgery.</s><s>Following surgery, the nasal cannula was cleaned daily to prevent clogging.</s><s>In this way, nasal cannulae typically stayed clear continuously for months of recordings.</s><s>During experiments, a plastic tube connected to a pressure sensor was fitted over the nasal cannula to form a continuous pressure environment.</s><s>Pressure signals were amplified 10Â, bandpass filtered 0.1-100 Hz, and recorded at 1000 samples per second.</s><s>For analysis, the start of each inhalation was identified as a negative-going zero crossing in the pressure signal.</s><s>Likewise, the end of each inhalation (i.e., start of exhalation) was identified as a subsequent positive-going zero crossing in the pressure signal.</s></p><p><s>Electrophysiology.</s><s>Neural activity was recorded with drives containing six tetrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gray et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>The tip of each wire was gold plated until the impedance was 250-450 kV.</s><s>Electrophysiological signals were acquired and amplified with a custom-made system built on two 16channel analog chips designed by Intan Technologies.</s><s>Each channel was digitized, sampled at 20 kHz, and bandpass filtered with a second-order Butterworth filter at 500-3000 Hz.</s><s>Potential spike events were detected as any activity that crossed 3.7 SDs of noise (corresponding to 1:10,000 events by chance).</s><s>Potential spike events were then manually clustered with MClust software (David Redish) to identify singleunit activity.</s><s>The quality of clustering was ensured by requiring ,1 in 1000 spikes to have occurred within a 2 ms refractory period of one another, clear overlap of singlespike waveforms, and L-distance ,0.05.</s><s>To minimize selection bias, all spikes that were visible during each session were recorded, sorted, and analyzed.</s><s>At the end of the recording session each day, the entire bundle of tetrodes was lowered 40 mm to obtain a new set of neurons for the subsequent day.</s><s>Following the completion of all behavior and recordings, tetrode placement was confirmed with an electrolytic lesion and postmortem histology.</s><s>Reconstruction was attempted on all mice, but the electrolytic lesion location was only identifiable in five of six pPC mice and five of eight OT mice.</s><s>We note that tetrodes were implanted with stereotactic technique to the same coordinates for each brain region across all animals, and we anticipate the remaining locations to also be on target (although we cannot be sure).</s></p><p><s>Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis.</s><s>To characterize the responses of neurons to odors, we used the metric of area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (auROC) for each cell-odor pair relative to baseline (i.e., prestimulus) firing rate.</s><s>The auROC gives a measure of how well the firing rate at any given time can be discriminated from the baseline firing rate for that cell, independent of the absolute firing rates.</s><s>Briefly, the value of the auROC for a given time bin indicates the percentile of that time bin in the distribution of baseline firing rates for bins of the same width.</s><s>Therefore, a firing rate that is exactly the median of the baseline firing rate distribution would have an auROC of 0.5.</s><s>Excitatory responses (yellow) correspond to an auROC .0.5 but 1, whereas inhibitory responses (blue) correspond to an auROC of ,0.5 but !0.</s><s>For analysis as well as data visualization, the auROC provides a more consistent measure to compare across neurons than absolute firing rate.</s></p><p><s>Decoding.</s><s>Decoding analysis (both identity and reward category) was done with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a linear kernel, using the standard 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% test.</s><s>Random shuffles from the entire population of neurons in a given region allowed many combinations, and therefore error estimates for decoding accuracy.</s><s>Responses were obtained in a standard window of 200 ms from the onset of odor and first sniff inhalation (but see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>, where this window was systematically varied).</s><s>Shuffle controls for decoding reward category were obtained by scrambling the valence assignment across the odors.</s></p><p><s>Experimental design and statistical analysis.</s><s>Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were calculated using the signrank function in MATLAB.</s><s>Data are available on request.</s></p></div>

contributions from different neuron types and subregions.</s></p><p><s>There is significant anatomic and pharmacological work implicating the OT in reward and motivated behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Heimer et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ikemoto, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ikemoto, , 2007))</ref>.</s><s>Recent work has implicated the OT in valence coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gadziola et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gadziola and Wesson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017a)</ref>, though the relationship between valence coding and stimulus tuning was not clear.</s><s>Here, we used a large number of odors to probe the breadth of stimulus responses when many different odors reliably predict reward or no reward.</s><s>We find that OT neurons multiplex odor identity and reward category information.</s><s>Additionally, the behavioral performance of the mouse for an individual odor is correlated with the ability to decode reward category from OT activity in response to that odor.</s><s>By monitoring sniffing, we could determine the timing of neural responses at high resolution and found that reward category-related activity in the OT arises rapidly (on average, 100 ms after the onset of sniffing, well before the average onset of the motor act).</s><s>In contrast, we found little evidence for an explicit representation of reward category information in the pPC, beyond that which is expected merely from sensory tuning.</s><s>This appears to be at odds with an earlier study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Calu et al., 2007)</ref> suggesting that the activity of pPC neurons can be modulated by reward.</s><s>However, that study used only a few odors and only a few cells (less than five) showed the effect, leaving open the possibility that the responses they observed were due to sensory tuning alone (as demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) or reflected lateronset brain-wide reward consumption or anticipatory signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schultz, 2000)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>How do OT neurons acquire reward-selective responses so early during learning?</s><s>The emergence of reward-selective responses in the striatum is not unprecedented.</s><s>Monkeys trained to associate reward with visual stimuli develop reward selectivity in the dorsal striatum that is apparent in the activity of individual neurons within a few trials of successful learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schultz et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, neurons in the prefrontal cortex took much longer to acquire reward selectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pasupathy and Miller, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>OT, at least in rodents, has been suggested to implement similar computations for olfactory information that the rest of striatum implements for other modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wesson and Wilson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Giessel and Datta, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, OT and dorsal striatum have a similar composition of cells (e.g., ;98% D 1 or D 2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons), comparable density of input from VTA, and the same output targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wesson and Wilson, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Our results strengthen the analogy between OT and dorsal striatum, adding physiological data to the known anatomic and cytoarchitecture similarities.</s></p><p><s>Reward-selective responses might emerge in the striatum early during learning to support decision-making.</s><s>Indeed, corticostriatal inputs have been shown to drive decision-making in an auditory discrimination task <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013)</ref>, and corticostriatal synapses exhibit plasticity over the course of training <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Xiong et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the strength of olfactory synaptic inputs to the ventral striatum can be modulated by optogenetic release of dopamine in slices <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Wieland et al., 2015)</ref>, and the activation of VTA projections to the OT can induce odor preference in mice <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al., 2017a)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Sensory processing begins with a dedicated channel (glomerulus) for each olfactory receptor in the OB.</s><s>An optimal linear readout of these channels is sufficient to determine the presence of any individual odor among at least a moderately sized (16 odor) panel of structurally similar odors and, thus, decide the appropriate motor action given a complex sensory scene <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mathis et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The success of a linear readout implies that any monosynaptic recipient of OB output could learn to make accurate sensorimotor decisions through biologically plausible mechanisms such as reward-gated Hebbian plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Reynolds and Wickens, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hung et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Loewenstein and Seung, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pfeiffer et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, one possible model for rapid learning of reward selectivity involves OB or PC inputs that evoke odor responses in OT being subsequently reinforced by dopamine release from VTA projections to the OT on reward delivery.</s></p><p><s>A study was published recently during the preparation of this article that takes a complementary approach to examine the relationship between pPC and OT in coding odor-reward associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gadziola et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Those authors use reward contingency reversals to demonstrate that odor-evoked responses in OT change in response to experimental manipulation of the reward valence predicted by the odor.</s><s>Their results corroborate the much denser reward coding in OT than pPC observed in our work.</s><s>In addition, our approach of training each mouse to learn many odor-reward associations enabled the dissociable characterization of odor and reward valence components of the tuning of the cells in the OT.</s><s>Together, along with previous literature, our two studies lend strong support for a central role of the OT in odor-driven reward-motivated behaviors.</s></p><p><s>Our study sheds light on the representation of a behaviorally relevant aspect of the environment, reward, and how it relates to sensory coding in the olfactory system.</s><s>The rapidity of odorguided learning in mice and the direct connectivity of the OT to the sensory periphery, as well as motor and reward areas, make this behavior and brain region attractive candidates for the dissection of rapid sensorimotor reinforcement.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
