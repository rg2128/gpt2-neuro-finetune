<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>response modifying odours offer powerful instruments for developing new generations of insect repellents and lures, which even in small quantities can interfere with the ability of mosquitoes to seek humans.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Text</head><p><s>Each year A. gambiae, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes transmit deadly diseases such as malaria and dengue to &gt;half a billion people and cause millions of deaths.</s><s>Female mosquitoes need to find and obtain a blood meal from an infected person and subsequently find an uninfected human-host to bite.</s><s>Disruption of host-seeking in mosquitoes could therefore reduce incidence of both steps.</s></p><p><s>Female mosquitoes depend primarily on olfactory cues that are emitted from human breath, skin and sweat to find hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Yet very few strategies that target the mosquito olfactory system, like the effective repellent DEET (N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , have emerged.</s><s>However, the relatively high cost of DEET, and need for repeated application to the skin at high concentrations (10-70%) precludes its use in tropical countries.</s><s>DEET is also known to melt plastics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , and to block cation channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and cholinesterase activity in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ..Moreover, DEET resistance has been observed in Drosophila melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Anopheles albimanus <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and A. aegypti <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , which reiterates a need to identify additional classes of repellents.</s></p><p><s>An ideal target for disrupting host-seeking is the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) detection machinery.</s><s>CO 2 exhaled by humans is a vital cue for mosquitoes.</s><s>Female mosquitoes are exquisitely sensitive to minute changes in CO 2 concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , which they potentially sense from long distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Upon encountering a plume of CO 2 , a female mosquito orients upwind using optomotor anemotaxis, while maintaining contact with the host-odour plume <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Remarkably, CO 2 exposure also increases the sensitivity of A. aegypti to human skin odours <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>CO 2 is detected by heteromeric receptor proteins that are highly conserved across dipterans including the three vector mosquitoes studied here and Drosophila 14 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), and are expressed in a dedicated labelled-line CO 2 -detection circuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> .</s><s>This circuit provides means to disrupt key aspects of host-seeking behaviour in multiple species.</s><s>Previously we identified odorants that inhibit electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO 2 in D. melanogaster, two of which also inhibited the CO 2 response in C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To identify more effective and across-species inhibitors of the conserved CO 2 receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , we screened a panel of compounds structurally related to the known inhibitors using singlesensillum electrophysiology on A. gambiae, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus females, and identified several efficient inhibitors for each (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The effects of some compounds were conserved across 250 MY of evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> while others were species-specific.</s><s>Subtle changes in structure influenced the strength of inhibition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), but volatility or solubility did not appear to be as important (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Inhibition was dosedependent (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) and the temporal dynamics of inhibition were odour-dependent (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Most trapping devices use CO 2 to attract mosquitoes.</s><s>Unfortunately, these are rarely used for surveillance or control in tropical countries because of high costs and difficulties in supplying CO 2 via gas cylinders, dry ice, or propane combustion.</s><s>Using a parallel electrophysiology screen we identified 2-butanone as a dose-dependent activator of the cpA neuron in all three mosquito species (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Repeated stimuli of 2butanone showed a temporal pattern of cpA neuron activation indistinguishable from that elicited by CO 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Such odours that mimic CO 2 activity, are ideal candidates for formulating convenient, compact, and economical lures for use in trap-based mosquito control in developing countries.</s></p><p><s>In the electrophysiology screen we also identified an additional structurally related odourant, 2,3-butanedione, which activates the cpA neuron in the three mosquito species (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>2,3-butanedione exhibits an unusual property: exposure to a brief 1-sec pulse results in ultra-prolonged activation of the cpA neuron (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>The activity of the cpA neuron remained high for the entire 5 ½-minute recording period.</s><s>In contrast, response to a comparable CO 2 stimulus rapidly decays immediately after the end of stimulus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that express Or genes rarely show this property and rapidly adapt in the first second upon stimulus exposure, even with a continuous stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Not much has been reported quantitatively on temporal response termination kinetics for single odorants beyond two seconds post stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>An individual neuron trace of a moth to a plant volatile suggests activation beyond the stimulus period <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>In another example an ORN of a male moth showed activity for &gt;10 minutes following a 1sec pulse of a pheromone analog, but only with an increase of ∼3 spikes/sec <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Most importantly, the brief 2,3-butanedione exposure evoked such a strong prolonged response in cpA neurons of A. gambiae and A. aegypti that responses to subsequent CO 2 stimuli during the 5.5-min recordings were severely reduced, displaying little activation above the high baseline firing of the neuron (Figure <ref type="figure">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>This property is neither enhanced nor reversed efficiently by a subsequent intervening stimulus of another activator, or inhibitors (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) suggesting that an active state, perhaps of the receptor, G-protein signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , or OBP may be stabilized by 2,3-butanedione.</s></p><p><s>To find more effective long-term maskers we tested multiple combinations of CO 2 responsemodifying odours and identified a blend of four odourants, 2,3-butanedione, 1-hexanol, 1butanal and 1-pentanal, which is effective at a 10-fold lower dilution <ref type="bibr">(10 -2</ref> ).</s><s>This blend caused prolonged activation and rendered the A. aegypti cpA neuron unresponsive to CO 2 stimuli throughout the 5.5 minute duration of the assay (Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e,</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>The effect of the "ultra-prolonged" odour(s) is specific to the CO 2 -sensitive cpA neuron since the response of a neighbouring neuron, with a smaller spike amplitude to 1octen-3-ol, was not affected (Figure <ref type="figure">2 d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>The same "ultra-prolonged" activating blend was also highly effective on the C. quinquefasciatus cpA neuron (Figure <ref type="figure">2f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Aedes females show rapid (&lt;200msec) and robust responses to entering (turn upwind) and exiting (turn crosswind) a plume of CO 2 , both important for source finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>In fact the cpA-neuron displays an exquisite temporal resolution of the presence or absence of abovebaseline concentrations of CO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) as required for a system whose sensory input plays a key role in the control of flight behaviour.</s><s>This form of rapid odour-evoked flight modulation (turning and surging) in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> involves both odour detection and discrimination dependent upon moment-to-moment changes in olfactory neuron activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Higher order projection neuron circuits are also particularly sensitive to the onset of odour stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Thus, an "ultra-prolonged activator" that compromises the ability of the sensory neuron to detect rapid changes in CO 2 concentration could disrupt CO 2 -mediated attraction behaviour very effectively.</s></p><p><s>To test the effect of ultra-prolonged activators on behavioural attraction to CO 2 , mated A. aegypti females were pre-treated with odourant(s) vapours and tested in a wind tunnel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Mock-treated A. aegypti females that were pre-exposed to solvent alone all left the holding cage, crossed the half-way point of the tunnel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) and navigated successfully along a turbulent CO 2 plume and flew through the CO 2 -emitting ring (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, females pre-exposed to the "ultra-prolonged" odour blend were impaired in their ability to fly upwind (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) as well as in finding the CO 2 source, in a dose and time-dependent manner (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>,e,f, Supplemental Videos 1-3).</s></p><p><s>After pre-treatment with the odour blend for 1-min, not only did fewer mosquitoes reach the source (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>,h), they also took longer to get there (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>The proportion of pre-treated mosquitoes that reached the CO 2 source increased as the assay progressed through 5 minutes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>,h), suggesting that their ability to detect CO 2 somewhat improves with time.</s><s>Pre-exposure to 2,3-butanedione caused more pronounced behavioural defects in CO 2 attraction than other components of the blend (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We determined the specificity of the effect of the odour blend by examining its effect on a different odour-mediated behaviour, and found that avoidance to DEET in a non-contact repellency chamber <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> was not reduced by pre-exposure to this blend (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>This result also suggests that, if desired, a long-range CO 2 -masking strategy might be used effectively in combination with short-range repellency to DEET.</s></p><p><s>We then tested for disruption of mosquito hut-entry behaviour in a semi-field environment in Kenya <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Host-seeking C. quinquefasciatus females were released overnight in a large enclosed greenhouse that contained two faux huts with CO 2 -emitting counter-flow geometry traps placed in each of them; females were attracted by the traps and entered the huts through the eaves, and a large majority were then trapped (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Inclusion of a source of the "ultra-prolonged" activating blend at 1% (dissolved in paraffin oil) in the form of small fan-driven odour dispensers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>) resulted in a significant reduction in the number of females that entered the CO 2trap in the treated hut.</s><s>Moreover, the total number of mosquitoes entering the treated hut but not trapped was also significantly lower than in the control hut, both indicating that "ultra prolonged activators" masked CO 2 -mediated attraction to the hut (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, odour treatment in one hut did not lead to an increase in the number of mosquitoes entering the control hut (44.25 mosquitoes/night), compared to numbers entering a similarly CO 2 -baited hut (56 mosquitoes/night) when odour-treatment was not applied to either hut.</s></p><p><s>In a separate greenhouse experiment, mosquitoes were given unrestricted access to a CO 2baited trap in a hut through open door, window and eaves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>There was a significant reduction in capture of female C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in the trap when the "ultra-prolonged" activating blend (3% in paraffin oil) was also continuously dispensed inside the hut (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>) as compared to control experiments in the untreated hut.</s><s>Thus, the odorant blend reduced the number of female mosquitoes inside a hut in both 2-choice and 1choice semi-field behaviour assays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we show that several aspects of CO 2 -mediated behaviour, including activation of upwind flight and navigation towards the CO 2 source, are severely reduced when detection of CO 2 by the cpA neuron is disrupted by exposure to an "ultra-prolonged" activating blend at concentrations as low as 0.1%.</s><s>Importantly, the "ultra-prolonged" blend is absent from the behaviour arena in the wind-tunnel assays.</s><s>This implies that the reduced attraction towards the CO 2 source cannot be attributed to detection of blend-components via other ORNs but is due to the inability of the cpA neurons in pre-treated mosquitoes to detect the CO 2 source.</s></p><p><s>To test whether an "ultra-prolonged" activator like 2,3-butanedione can become attractive at lower concentrations (10 -3 and 10 -4 ), we tested it overnight as an evaporating lure in a counterflow-geometry trap for Culex females in a large enclosed arena in California as well as on female Aedes mosquitoes for attraction towards a turbulent plume of 2,3-butanedione at 10 -3 in a wind tunnel.</s><s>Lower concentrations of the ultra-prolonged activator did not act as an attractive cue for mosquitoes in either assay (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In summary we describe a novel coding mechanism where "ultra-prolonged" activation of a sensory neuron modifies its ability to detect and transmit information about changes in concentrations of its ligands in the environment.</s><s>Along with this class of ligands we have also identified inhibitors and activators of the mosquito CO 2 neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>).</s><s>Several characteristics of these novel classes of volatile chemicals offer powerful advantages as potential tools for reducing mosquito-human contact.</s><s>First, volatile odorants that mask or repel mosquitoes at low concentrations, and that can be easily dispersed in the air, may protect several individuals within a large area.</s><s>Second, area masking agents and repellents may be effective without application on skin, and thus the convenience may lead to widespread adoption in developing countries.</s><s>Third, the use of multiple-odour blends to modify behaviour might delay the emergence of resistant strains, a common concern with other methods of mosquito control.</s><s>Compounds reported in this initial proof-of-principle investigation such as 2,3-butanedione have undesirable safety profiles at high concentrations and are not ideal for human use without further testing.</s><s>However the structures of the agonists and antagonists we have described in this study have enabled us to identify important structural features and pharmacophores (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>) that provide a rational foundation to find additional odorants with improved efficacy and safety profiles.</s><s>Identification of such molecules is of extremely high priority, which may be effective at lower concentrations, is environmentally friendly, economical and useful in preventing mosquito borne diseases.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behaviour in wind tunnel</head><p><s>Wind-tunnel behaviour experiments were performed as described previously 2 with some modifications.</s><s>Briefly, female mated non-blood fed A. aegypti mosquitoes between 7-14 days of age raised in a 14:10 hour light-dark cycle were individually collected in release cages and held for 21 hours at 25°C and 70% relative humidity.</s><s>Mosquitoes in the cage were then transferred into an upended 1 L glass beaker with 100 μL of odour diluted in paraffin oil at the indicated concentration.</s><s>The mosquito in the release cage was removed from the odour and beaker and transferred in room air across the room to the wind tunnel (within ∼15 sec) where it was carefully manipulated into the release cage.</s><s>Air from outside the building was presented in the wind tunnel in a laminar flow at a controlled rate of 30 cm 3 /sec, at ∼70% relative humidity, temperature ∼23°C.</s><s>A turbulent plume of 1% CO 2 was generated by mixing purified CO 2 and air from cylinders (Airgas) and delivered through a glass ring with 8 outlets pointing inwards.</s><s>The cage was opened remotely to release an individual female mosquito.</s><s>Two video cameras were used to record the flight path.</s><s>Analyses of videos were performed on computers offline.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behaviour in repellency chamber</head><p><s>A stainless steel repellency chamber used a standard design <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>A stainless steel plate was added underneath the smaller screened inner cage to hold the stimulus-loaded paper thus preventing contact with mosquitoes.</s><s>A blotting paper (12″×7″ inches) was impregnated with 5 ml of 9.8% DEET (Jungle Juice 98% DEET, REI diluted in acetone) and the solvent allowed to evaporate inside a fume hood for 30 mins before placement on the steel plate inside the repellency chamber.</s><s>Twenty female A. aegypti between 1-2 weeks old were transferred to a release cage 30-mins prior to assay start, and pre-exposed to odourant blend exactly as described previously right before start of assay.</s><s>Mosquitoes were released inside the inner chamber from the release cage and the lights turned off, and the number of mosquitoes escaping from the exit spout at the end of 5 mins counted.</s><s>Equipment was cleaned with acetone or ethanol and dried to avoid contamination.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-Choice Behaviour in MalariaSphere</head><p><s>Experiments were conducted at the Thomas Odhiambo Field Station of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Mbita Point, western Kenya in late April to June.</s><s>Culex quinquefasciatus were obtained from the existing rabbit-blood fed colonies at the station insectary.</s><s>At 18:00 hours 100 female and 20 male Culex were released remotely for every experiment from the centre of a large glass-covered MalariaSphere and allowed to enter either of two huts on two sides until 07:00 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>), each running one CO 2 -baited (250ml/min) counterflow geometry trap (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Each hut also ran two TimeMist® Fan dispensers starting 30-mins prior to mosquito release and run for duration of the assay, the test with a container containing 15 ml of odour (1% in paraffin oil), and the control with container of 15 ml paraffin oil.</s><s>The huts were fitted with one-way entry ports in the eaves as the only mosquito entry points in order to enable us to count all entering mosquitoes, with windows covered by nets and doors closed.</s><s>Additionally, huts were lined with clean black cotton sheets that could be removed and washed to reduce odour contamination between trials.</s><s>Treatment huts and trap positions were randomized.</s><s>At end of trial mosquitoes were counted in each trap and inside each hut.</s><s>Additional non-participating mosquitoes inside the MalariaSphere were removed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>One-Choice Behaviour in MalariaSphere</head><p><s>A smaller single-hut net-covered MalariaSphere (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>) was used.</s><s>At 18:00 hours, 100 female and 20 male Culex mosquitoes were released inside the MalariaSphere and allowed to enter the hut freely through open eaves, door and window.</s><s>A CO 2 -baited (250ml/min) counterflow geometry trap was started at 18:00 inside the hut and trapped mosquitoes were counted at 07:00.</s><s>One TimeMist® Fan dispenser ran continuously during the 4-day duration of the 4 overnight trials with a container containing 15 ml of odour (3%) /paraffin oil which was replaced every 24 hours.</s><s>Because we observed possible long-term contamination effects in thatched roofs and netting in pilot experiments, the no-odour controls were run before odour-treatment to avoid contamination.</s><s>Untrapped mosquitoes were not removed from the MalariaSphere and their approximate numbers taken into account while calculating percentage caught for each night.</s></p></div>
