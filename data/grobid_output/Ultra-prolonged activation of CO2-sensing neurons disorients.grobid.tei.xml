<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>response modifying odours offer powerful instruments for developing new generations of insect repellents and lures, which even in small quantities can interfere with the ability of mosquitoes to seek humans.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Text</head><p><s>Each year A. gambiae, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes transmit deadly diseases such as malaria and dengue to &gt;half a billion people and cause millions of deaths.</s><s>Female mosquitoes need to find and obtain a blood meal from an infected person and subsequently find an uninfected human-host to bite.</s><s>Disruption of host-seeking in mosquitoes could therefore reduce incidence of both steps.</s></p><p><s>Female mosquitoes depend primarily on olfactory cues that are emitted from human breath, skin and sweat to find hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Yet very few strategies that target the mosquito olfactory system, like the effective repellent DEET (N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , have emerged.</s><s>However, the relatively high cost of DEET, and need for repeated application to the skin at high concentrations (10-70%) precludes its use in tropical countries.</s><s>DEET is also known to melt plastics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , and to block cation channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and cholinesterase activity in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ..Moreover, DEET resistance has been observed in Drosophila melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Anopheles albimanus <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and A. aegypti <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , which reiterates a need to identify additional classes of repellents.</s></p><p><s>An ideal target for disrupting host-seeking is the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) detection machinery.</s><s>CO 2 exhaled by humans is a vital cue for mosquitoes.</s><s>Female mosquitoes are exquisitely sensitive to minute changes in CO 2 concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , which they potentially sense from long distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Upon encountering a plume of CO 2 , a female mosquito orients upwind using optomotor anemotaxis, while maintaining contact with the host-odour plume <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Remarkably, CO 2 exposure also increases the sensitivity of A. aegypti to human skin odours <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>CO 2 is detected by heteromeric receptor proteins that are highly conserved across dipterans including the three vector mosquitoes studied here and Drosophila 14 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), and are expressed in a dedicated labelled-line CO 2 -detection circuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> .</s><s>This circuit provides means to disrupt key aspects of host-seeking behaviour in multiple species.</s><s>Previously we identified odorants that inhibit electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO 2 in D. melanogaster, two of which also inhibited the CO 2 response in C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To identify more effective and across-species inhibitors of the conserved CO 2 receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , we screened a panel of compounds structurally related to the known inhibitors using singlesensillum electrophysiology on A. gambiae, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus females, and identified several efficient inhibitors for each (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The effects of some compounds were conserved across 250 MY of evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> while others were species-specific.</s><s>Subtle changes in structure influenced the strength of inhibition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), but volatility or solubility did not appear to be as important (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Inhibition was dosedependent (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) and the temporal dynamics of inhibition were odour-dependent (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Most trapping devices use CO 2 to attract mosquitoes.</s><s>Unfortunately, these are rarely used for surveillance or control in tropical countries because of high costs and difficulties in supplying CO 2 via gas cylinders, dry ice, or propane combustion.</s><s>Using a parallel electrophysiology screen we identified 2-butanone as a dose-dependent activator of the cpA neuron in all three mosquito species (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Repeated stimuli of 2butanone showed a temporal pattern of cpA neuron activation indistinguishable from that elicited by CO 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Such odours that mimic CO 2 activity, are ideal candidates for formulating convenient, compact, and economical lures for use in trap-based mosquito control in developing countries.</s></p><p><s>In the electrophysiology screen we also identified an additional structurally related odourant, 2,3-butanedione, which activates the cpA neuron in the three mosquito species (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>2,3-butanedione exhibits an unusual property: exposure to a brief 1-sec pulse results in ultra-prolonged activation of the cpA neuron (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>The activity of the cpA neuron remained high for the entire 5 ¬Ω-minute recording period.</s><s>In contrast, response to a comparable CO 2 stimulus rapidly decays immediately after the end of stimulus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that express Or genes rarely show this property and rapidly adapt in the first second upon stimulus exposure, even with a continuous stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Not much has been reported quantitatively on temporal response termination kinetics for single odorants beyond two seconds post stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>An individual neuron trace of a moth to a plant volatile suggests activation beyond the stimulus period <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>In another example an ORN of a male moth showed activity for &gt;10 minutes following a 1sec pulse of a pheromone analog, but only with an increase of ‚àº3 spikes/sec <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Most importantly, the brief 2,3-butanedione exposure evoked such a strong prolonged response in cpA neurons of A. gambiae and A. aegypti that responses to subsequent CO 2 stimuli during the 5.5-min recordings were severely reduced, displaying little activation above the high baseline firing of the neuron (Figure <ref type="figure">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>This property is neither enhanced nor reversed efficiently by a subsequent intervening stimulus of another activator, or inhibitors (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) suggesting that an active state, perhaps of the receptor, G-protein signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , or OBP may be stabilized by 2,3-butanedione.</s></p><p><s>To find more effective long-term maskers we tested multiple combinations of CO 2 responsemodifying odours and identified a blend of four odourants, 2,3-butanedione, 1-hexanol, 1butanal and 1-pentanal, which is effective at a 10-fold lower dilution <ref type="bibr">(10 -2</ref> ).</s><s>This blend caused prolonged activation and rendered the A. aegypti cpA neuron unresponsive to CO 2 stimuli throughout the 5.5 minute duration of the assay (Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e,</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>The effect of the "ultra-prolonged" odour(s) is specific to the CO 2 -sensitive cpA neuron since the response of a neighbouring neuron, with a smaller spike amplitude to 1octen-3-ol, was not affected (Figure <ref type="figure">2 d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>The same "ultra-prolonged" activating blend was also highly effective on the C. quinquefasciatus cpA neuron (Figure <ref type="figure">2f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Aedes females show rapid (&lt;200msec) and robust responses to entering (turn upwind) and exiting (turn crosswind) a plume of CO 2 , both important for source finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>In fact the cpA-neuron displays an exquisite temporal resolution of the presence or absence of abovebaseline concentrations of CO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) as required for a system whose sensory input plays a key role in the control of flight behaviour.</s><s>This form of rapid odour-evoked flight modulation (turning and surging) in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> involves both odour detection and discrimination dependent upon moment-to-moment changes in olfactory neuron activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Higher order projection neuron circuits are also particularly sensitive to the onset of odour stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Thus, an "ultra-prolonged activator" that compromises the ability of the sensory neuron to detect rapid changes in CO 2 concentration could disrupt CO 2 -mediated attraction behaviour very effectively.</s></p><p><s>To test the effect of ultra-prolonged activators on behavioural attraction to CO 2 , mated A. aegypti females were pre-treated with odourant(s) vapours and tested in a wind tunnel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Mock-treated A. aegypti females that were pre-exposed to solvent alone all left the holding cage, crossed the half-way point of the tunnel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) and navigated successfully along a turbulent CO 2 plume and flew through the CO 2 -emitting ring (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, females pre-exposed to the "ultra-prolonged" odour blend were impaired in their ability to fly upwind (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) as well as in finding the CO 2 source, in a dose and time-dependent manner (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>,e,f, Supplemental Videos 1-3).</s></p><p><s>After pre-treatment with the odour blend for 1-min, not only did fewer mosquitoes reach the source (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>,h), they also took longer to get there (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>The proportion of pre-treated mosquitoes that reached the CO 2 source increased as the assay progressed through 5 minutes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>,h), suggesting that their ability to detect CO 2 somewhat improves with time.</s><s>Pre-exposure to 2,3-butanedione caused more pronounced behavioural defects in CO 2 attraction than other components of the blend (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We determined the specificity of the effect of the odour blend by examining its effect on a different odour-mediated behaviour, and found that avoidance to DEET in a non-contact repellency chamber <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> was not reduced by pre-exposure to this blend (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>This result also suggests that, if desired, a long-range CO 2 -masking strategy might be used effectively in combination with short-range repellency to DEET.</s></p><p><s>We then tested for disruption of mosquito hut-entry behaviour in a semi-field environment in Kenya <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Host-seeking C. quinquefasciatus females were released overnight in a large enclosed greenhouse that contained two faux huts with CO 2 -emitting counter-flow geometry traps placed in each of them; females were attracted by the traps and entered the huts through the eaves, and a large majority were then trapped (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Inclusion of a source of the "ultra-prolonged" activating blend at 1% (dissolved in paraffin oil) in the form of small fan-driven odour dispensers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>, Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>) resulted in a significant reduction in the number of females that entered the CO 2trap in the treated hut.</s><s>Moreover, the total number of mosquitoes entering the treated hut but not trapped was also significantly lower than in the control hut, both indicating that "ultra prolonged activators" masked CO 2 -mediated attraction to the hut (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, odour treatment in one hut did not lead to an increase in the number of mosquitoes entering the control hut (44.25 mosquitoes/night), compared to numbers entering a similarly CO 2 -baited hut (56 mosquitoes/night) when odour-treatment was not applied to either hut.</s></p><p><s>In a separate greenhouse experiment, mosquitoes were given unrestricted access to a CO 2baited trap in a hut through open door, window and eaves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>There was a significant reduction in capture of female C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in the trap when the "ultra-prolonged" activating blend (3% in paraffin oil) was also continuously dispensed inside the hut (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>) as compared to control experiments in the untreated hut.</s><s>Thus, the odorant blend reduced the number of female mosquitoes inside a hut in both 2-choice and 1choice semi-field behaviour assays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we show that several aspects of CO 2 -mediated behaviour, including activation of upwind flight and navigation towards the CO 2 source, are severely reduced when detection of CO 2 by the cpA neuron is disrupted by exposure to an "ultra-prolonged" activating blend at concentrations as low as 0.1%.</s><s>Importantly, the "ultra-prolonged" blend is absent from the behaviour arena in the wind-tunnel assays.</s><s>This implies that the reduced attraction towards the CO 2 source cannot be attributed to detection of blend-components via other ORNs but is due to the inability of the cpA neurons in pre-treated mosquitoes to detect the CO 2 source.</s></p><p><s>To test whether an "ultra-prolonged" activator like 2,3-butanedione can become attractive at lower concentrations (10 -3 and 10 -4 ), we tested it overnight as an evaporating lure in a counterflow-geometry trap for Culex females in a large enclosed arena in California as well as on female Aedes mosquitoes for attraction towards a turbulent plume of 2,3-butanedione at 10 -3 in a wind tunnel.</s><s>Lower concentrations of the ultra-prolonged activator did not act as an attractive cue for mosquitoes in either assay (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In summary we describe a novel coding mechanism where "ultra-prolonged" activation of a sensory neuron modifies its ability to detect and transmit information about changes in concentrations of its ligands in the environment.</s><s>Along with this class of ligands we have also identified inhibitors and activators of the mosquito CO 2 neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>).</s><s>Several characteristics of these novel classes of volatile chemicals offer powerful advantages as potential tools for reducing mosquito-human contact.</s><s>First, volatile odorants that mask or repel mosquitoes at low concentrations, and that can be easily dispersed in the air, may protect several individuals within a large area.</s><s>Second, area masking agents and repellents may be effective without application on skin, and thus the convenience may lead to widespread adoption in developing countries.</s><s>Third, the use of multiple-odour blends to modify behaviour might delay the emergence of resistant strains, a common concern with other methods of mosquito control.</s><s>Compounds reported in this initial proof-of-principle investigation such as 2,3-butanedione have undesirable safety profiles at high concentrations and are not ideal for human use without further testing.</s><s>However the structures of the agonists and antagonists we have described in this study have enabled us to identify important structural features and pharmacophores (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>) that provide a rational foundation to find additional odorants with improved efficacy and safety profiles.</s><s>Identification of such molecules is of extremely high priority, which may be effective at lower concentrations, is environmentally friendly, economical and useful in preventing mosquito borne diseases.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behaviour in wind tunnel</head><p><s>Wind-tunnel behaviour experiments were performed as described previously 2 with some modifications.</s><s>Briefly, female mated non-blood fed A. aegypti mosquitoes between 7-14 days of age raised in a 14:10 hour light-dark cycle were individually collected in release cages and held for 21 hours at 25¬∞C and 70% relative humidity.</s><s>Mosquitoes in the cage were then transferred into an upended 1 L glass beaker with 100 ŒºL of odour diluted in paraffin oil at the indicated concentration.</s><s>The mosquito in the release cage was removed from the odour and beaker and transferred in room air across the room to the wind tunnel (within ‚àº15 sec) where it was carefully manipulated into the release cage.</s><s>Air from outside the building was presented in the wind tunnel in a laminar flow at a controlled rate of 30 cm 3 /sec, at ‚àº70% relative humidity, temperature ‚àº23¬∞C.</s><s>A turbulent plume of 1% CO 2 was generated by mixing purified CO 2 and air from cylinders (Airgas) and delivered through a glass ring with 8 outlets pointing inwards.</s><s>The cage was opened remotely to release an individual female mosquito.</s><s>Two video cameras were used to record the flight path.</s><s>Analyses of videos were performed on computers offline.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behaviour in repellency chamber</head><p><s>A stainless steel repellency chamber used a standard design <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>A stainless steel plate was added underneath the smaller screened inner cage to hold the stimulus-loaded paper thus preventing contact with mosquitoes.</s><s>A blotting paper (12‚Ä≥√ó7‚Ä≥ inches) was impregnated with 5 ml of 9.8% DEET (Jungle Juice 98% DEET, REI diluted in acetone) and the solvent allowed to evaporate inside a fume hood for 30 mins before placement on the steel plate inside the repellency chamber.</s><s>Twenty female A. aegypti between 1-2 weeks old were transferred to a release cage 30-mins prior to assay start, and pre-exposed to odourant blend exactly as described previously right before start of assay.</s><s>Mosquitoes were released inside the inner chamber from the release cage and the lights turned off, and the number of mosquitoes escaping from the exit spout at the end of 5 mins counted.</s><s>Equipment was cleaned with acetone or ethanol and dried to avoid contamination.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-Choice Behaviour in MalariaSphere</head><p><s>Experiments were conducted at the Thomas Odhiambo Field Station of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Mbita Point, western Kenya in late April to June.</s><s>Culex quinquefasciatus were obtained from the existing rabbit-blood fed colonies at the station insectary.</s><s>At 18:00 hours 100 female and 20 male Culex were released remotely for every experiment from the centre of a large glass-covered MalariaSphere and allowed to enter either of two huts on two sides until 07:00 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>), each running one CO 2 -baited (250ml/min) counterflow geometry trap (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Each hut also ran two TimeMist¬Æ Fan dispensers starting 30-mins prior to mosquito release and run for duration of the assay, the test with a container containing 15 ml of odour (1% in paraffin oil), and the control with container of 15 ml paraffin oil.</s><s>The huts were fitted with one-way entry ports in the eaves as the only mosquito entry points in order to enable us to count all entering mosquitoes, with windows covered by nets and doors closed.</s><s>Additionally, huts were lined with clean black cotton sheets that could be removed and washed to reduce odour contamination between trials.</s><s>Treatment huts and trap positions were randomized.</s><s>At end of trial mosquitoes were counted in each trap and inside each hut.</s><s>Additional non-participating mosquitoes inside the MalariaSphere were removed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>One-Choice Behaviour in MalariaSphere</head><p><s>A smaller single-hut net-covered MalariaSphere (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>) was used.</s><s>At 18:00 hours, 100 female and 20 male Culex mosquitoes were released inside the MalariaSphere and allowed to enter the hut freely through open eaves, door and window.</s><s>A CO 2 -baited (250ml/min) counterflow geometry trap was started at 18:00 inside the hut and trapped mosquitoes were counted at 07:00.</s><s>One TimeMist¬Æ Fan dispenser ran continuously during the 4-day duration of the 4 overnight trials with a container containing 15 ml of odour (3%) /paraffin oil which was replaced every 24 hours.</s><s>Because we observed possible long-term contamination effects in thatched roofs and netting in pilot experiments, the no-odour controls were run before odour-treatment to avoid contamination.</s><s>Untrapped mosquitoes were not removed from the MalariaSphere and their approximate numbers taken into account while calculating percentage caught for each night.</s></p></div>
