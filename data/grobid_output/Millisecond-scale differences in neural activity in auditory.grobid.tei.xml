Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>We designed the stimulation patterns so that the only cue available to guide behaviour was the relative timing of the activity elicited in the two cortical populations.</s></p><p><s>We first trained adult male Long Evans rats to perform a simple auditory two alternative choice task (2-AC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>The animal initiated a trial by inserting its nose into the centre port of a three port operant chamber, triggering one of two acoustic stimuli.</s><s>These stimuli indicated whether the left or right goal port would be rewarded with water (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>; for details, see Supplemental material).</s><s>Chance performance was 50%.</s><s>After animals reached criterion performance (&gt; 90%), we implanted electrodes at two sites (A and B; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) about 1.1 mm apart along the rostro-caudal axis in the rat's left primary auditory cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>).</s><s>We then substituted electrical stimulation (&lt; 30 µA) through these electrodes for the acoustic cue on the 2-AC task.</s><s>Stimulus 1 (associated with the left reward port) consisted of simultaneous (AB) stimulation of the two intracortical sites, whereas stimulus 2 (associated with the right reward port) consisted of sequential (B-ISI-A) stimulation of the two sites.</s><s>The two stimuli were separated by a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) which ranged from 1 to 100 msec.</s><s>After animals reached criterion performance for long ISIs (100 or 35 msec), we reduced the ISI to probe the psychophysical limit for discrimination in the timing of the activity of the two cortical populations.</s></p><p><s>Twenty-six rats successfully learned the easy discrimination (A vs. B) and were trained on more challenging tasks.</s><s>The training history of one subject is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>.</s><s>Like most subjects, it rapidly learned to perform the discrimination for long ISIs (24/26 subjects trained on ISI=100 or ISI=35 msec performed above chance, p&lt;0.01; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> and Supplemental material).</s><s>Surprisingly, this subject also performed above chance (p&lt;0.01) when challenged with the finer temporal discriminations of ISI=5 and even ISI=3 msec, but not ISI=1 msec.</s><s>Over the population, most subjects (10/15) challenged with ISI=5 msec performed above chance (p&lt;0.01;</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>); in some sessions performance exceeded 90% even at this short interval (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Two subjects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">S2-o</ref>) performed above chance even for ISI=3msec, but none of four subjects trained on ISI=1msec performed above chance.</s><s>Performance declined with task difficulty both among (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) and within (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>) subjects, but performance was variable; differences in performance could also be due to variability in the location of the electrodes, the effectiveness of the electrical stimulation, or other experimental factors.</s></p><p><s>Our results demonstrate that even fine differences as short as three milliseconds in the timing of artificially induced neuronal activity in the auditory cortex can be used to guide behaviour.</s><s>Although artificial cortical microstimulation can be perceptually indistinguishable from natural stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , this need not always be the case; our results do not reveal the conditions under which such fine temporal differences are important for the readout of acoustically-evoked (i.e.</s><s>natural) stimuli.</s><s>Nevertheless, the ability of the animal to read out such subtle differences in timing raises the possibility that for some stimuli, the timing of cortical spikes can be behaviourally relevant.</s></p><p><s>Our experiments were conducted in the primary auditory cortex.</s><s>Experiments in the somatosensory cortex have failed to find a correlation between spike timing and behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Audition is often considered to be a "fast" modality, and it is clearly one in which subtle differences in temporal structure can be behaviourally relevant.</s><s>However, no special biophysical or circuit mechanisms need be posited to account for our result; many simple candidate neural circuits could mediate the readout of the fine timing differences we have described.</s><s>Indeed, in auditory cortex the stereotyped sequence of excitatory activity followed 3 msec later by inhibitory activity 8 suggests one possible mechanism for the present results.</s><s>Further experiments will be needed to resolve whether the capacity to exploit fine temporal differences is unique to the auditory cortex, or if it is a general strategy for cortical function (but see ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> ).</s></p></div>

If they could perform the task above chance, we trained them to go left for simultaneous stimulation of A and B, and to go right for stimulation in B only.</s><s>After they could perform this task above chance, we introduced an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) into the task by adding stimulation in site A to the right stimulus.</s><s>We started with ISI = 100 msec, and reduced it to probe the behavioral threshold.</s><s>For rats mz, we began each day of training with a few trials of the easier (ISI=100 msec) task to confirm that the animal was still able to detect stimulation from both sites before challenging with shorter ISIs.</s></p><p><s>In initial experiments (subjects a-o), we reduced the ISI gradually with multiple intermediate steps to obtain an estimate of the timing threshold.</s><s>The intermediate ISIs included 55 msec, 35 msec, 15 msec, 7 msec, and 5 msec.</s><s>If an animal could perform a task at a certain ISI above chance, we probed with a shorter ISI until the animal failed for two consecutive sessions, after which we trained the animal again on the ISI = 100 msec</s></p></div>			</div>
