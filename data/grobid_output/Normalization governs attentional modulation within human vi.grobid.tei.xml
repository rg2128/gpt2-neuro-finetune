between the stimulus activity and the summed activity of the normalization pool, weakening the current state of gain control, and thereby resulting in an increased neural response.</s><s>Normalization accounts of attention have traditionally hinged on three key components: the locus of attention, the size of the stimulus, and the size of the attentional window <ref type="bibr"

to be feature-agnostic, allowing an equal contribution of all information, regardless of feature similarities.</s><s>The notion that attention modulation could additionally depend on a fourth component, incorporating the feature-selective nature of normalization, has some support in animal studies, with single-unit recordings in macaques suggesting that the contribution of tuned

approach this problem by first devising an efficacious, voxel-by-voxel population measure of the feature-tuned aspects of normalization within early visual cortex, during passive viewing.</s><s>To do

stimuli sharing the same features are more strongly normalized than stimuli that differ in their features.</s><s>Armed with a population measure of feature-tuned normalization, we set out to test the hypothesis that attentional modulation is partially driven by tuned normalization.</s><s>If normalization truly governs attentional modulation, we reason that attention-driven gain changes will be greater when a neural subpopulation within early visual areas exhibits stronger normalization.</s><s>Indeed, in our second experiment we reveal that tuned normalization is tightly linked to an independent measure of attentional modulation.</s><s>Leveraging population-wide heterogeneities in BOLD responses for both normalization and attention measures, we find that subpopulations that exhibit stronger normalization also exhibit larger attentional benefits.</s><s>Finally, in a third converging experiment, we directly manipulate spatial attention, while simultaneously measuring population activity under different states of normalization.</s><s>In doing so, we demonstrate that attentional benefits are greater when the population is put under stronger normalization.</s><s>In sum, our results suggest that a neural population's capability for attentional benefits appears contingent upon normalization, whereby the degree to which a population can normalize itself results in greater potential for attentional modulation.</s></p></div>

inner diameter 3°; at 50% Michelson contrast; spatial frequencies between 2 and 3 cycles/°; orientation bandwidth of 10°).</s><s>Importantly, images were constructed using pairs of stimuli combined in either an orthogonal (different features) or a collinear configuration (similar features; Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>We measured BOLD responses to these collinear and orthogonal stimuli configurations in separate blocks during an fMRI session, while participants performed a demanding task at fixation, finding targets in a rapid letter stream, and ignoring the stimuli presented in the periphery (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>In addition, in a separate set of scans we measured the BOLD response to both individual components (45°&amp; 135°), in separate blocks, that comprised the overlaid stimuli, and summed the responses for each component in order to create a hypothetical additive sum.</s><s>Note, we did not find a difference in the evoked responses to individual components when oriented radial or tangential from fixation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The sub-additive deviation from the hypothetical sum for both the collinear and orthogonal configurations served as our measure of untuned normalization, while comparing the difference between responses evoked by the two overlaid configurations served as our measure for an additional tuned component.</s></p><p><s>Orthogonal and collinear stimuli configurations both exhibited sub-additivity across early visual areas (V1-V3), with the measured BOLD response of both stimulus configurations being lower than the hypothetical additive sum (repeated measures ANOVA orthogonal sub-additivity: main effect of additivity F (1,15) = 16.39,</s><s>p = 0.001, η 2 p = 0.522, main effect for visual area and the interaction, p &gt;

feature-tuned normalization.</s><s>The magnitude of attentional modulation depends on the degree to which a population has normalized its response, based on the degree of feature similarity within an image.</s><s>In the first experiment, we utilized an efficacious method to probe orientation-tuned normalization of population responses within human early visual cortex.</s><s>By superimposing stimuli that differed in their orientation content, we found that BOLD responses were lower for stimuli that matched in their visual features, compared with stimuli that were comprised of different features.</s><s>In a second experiment, we found a tight voxel-wise relationship between this measure of tuned normalization strength and an independent measure of attention modulation, suggesting that attention optimizes information processing by modulating divisive normalization.</s><s>Critically, in a third experiment, we provided direct converging evidence that the magnitude of attentional benefits depends on the degree to which a population has normalized its response; when a neural population was put under a stronger suppressive state, the largest attentional effects emerged.</s></p><p><s>Our results square with a normalization-based model of attention, which posits that attentional modulation arises through interactions with divisive normalization <ref

model proposes that the spatial extent of an 'attention field' can reshape either relative to the stimulus size or to match a particular feature in order to modulate a population response, and suppression is considered to be feature-agnostic, acting independently from the selective properties computed within a respective region.</s><s>However, divisive normalization is modulated by contextual influences, where feature similarity results in stronger normalization, a property the model currently does not account for.</s><s>Extending the standard normalization model by incorporating a tuned component into the suppressive drive could potentially account for differences between the two stimuli configurations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> and see the Methods section).</s><s>Previous work has suggested that instead of incorporating a tuned suppressive component into the normalization model of attention, a more parsimonious description to

constant, in order to investigate the role that feature-tuned normalization has on attentional modulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>We find that the magnitude of attention is greatest when stimuli match in their visual features.</s><s>This finding is not readily explained by the normalization model of attention, and instead would need to be extended such that feature similarity results in a release from normalization with attention.</s><s>Future research measuring the full neural contrast response function, and manipulating features such as the size and shape of the attentional window, will shed more light on precisely how this contribution of feature-tuning is best incorporated into the normalization model of attention.</s><s>Normalization has been
