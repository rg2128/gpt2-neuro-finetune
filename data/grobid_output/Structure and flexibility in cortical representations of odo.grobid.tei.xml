these models further argue that cortical codes for odor relationships should be invariant across individuals, as peripheral representations of chemical relationships are largely determined by odor receptor specificity, which is encoded in the genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>However, in addition to receiving inputs from the OB, PCx neurons are linked through a dense web of excitatory interconnections, suggesting that olfactory cortex may act as an auto-associative network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Such networks use Hebbian mechanisms to construct cell assemblies that encode information about stimulus relationships (like feature similarity or temporal coincidence) through correlated activity.</s><s>In the case of PCx, auto-associative mechanisms are predicted to both increase generalization across chemically similar odors, and to render cortical odor representations sensitive to passive odor experience, thereby reshaping pairwise odor relationships inherited from OB inputs.</s><s>While PCx exhibits characteristics consistent with both random and auto-associative networks, it remains unclear whether cortex systematically encodes information about odor chemical relationships; whether any such representation preserves or reshapes odor relational information conveyed by the OB; or whether cortical odor representations are primarily decorrelated (thereby favoring odor discrimination as predicted by random network models) or correlated (thereby favoring odor generalization as predicted by auto-associative models).</s></p><p><s>To address these questions, we used multiphoton microscopy in mice expressing GCaMP6s within PCx to assess neural activity both in the input-dominated PCx layer 2 (L2), and in the more associational layer 3 (L3, whose odor responses have not yet been described) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>).</s><s>We took advantage of a library of odor descriptors that quantifies thousands of physiochemical features, such as molecular weight, polarizability and hydrophobicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , to rationally design three sets of 22 odors each: a "global" odor set, which included structurally diverse odorants well separated in odor space; a "clustered" odor set divided into six odor subsets, each of which shared functional groups and other structural features; and a "tiled" odor set, in which the carbon chain length of a ketone, an ester, an aldehyde and an acid was incrementally varied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>Although each odor set captured progressively less chemical variance, by construction individual odors in the clustered set (within each of the six subsets) were most closely related, while odors were separated at intermediate scales in the tiled set.</s><s>We noted that under anesthesia odor responses in L3 (and to a lesser extent L2) were attenuated or absent; recordings were therefore performed during wakefulness, a state in which L3 neurons were significantly more active (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, see Methods).</s></p><p><s>All odors evoked selective excitation and suppression, with PCx L3 responses being denser, broader and more reliable than those in L2 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Odors evoked more correlated activity across the population of PCx neurons (i.e., ensemble correlations) than was expected by chance, with greater correlations observed in L3 compared to L2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>These findings raised the possibility that correlated odor-evoked responses among PCx ensembles systematically reflect chemical relationships among odor stimuli.</s><s>To explore this possibility, correlation distance matrices were generated for each odor set based upon the physiochemical descriptors that characterize each odorant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>Odors in the global set were the least chemically correlated with each other, while odors in the clustered odor set exhibited substantial block diagonal structure, consistent with subsets of odors sharing key chemical attributes.</s><s>Because molecules in the tiled set are related along two chemical axes (for example, heptanone and octanone differ by one carbon atom while heptanone and pentyl acetate differ by one oxygen atom), the matrix describing these odors exhibited periodic on-and off-diagonal structure.</s></p><p><s>Visual comparison and quantification demonstrated that odor chemistry and neural responses were only weakly related in the global odor set; in contrast, cortical odor responses maintained the block diagonal physiochemical correlation structure apparent in the clustered odor set, demonstrating that at close chemical distances PCx represents odor chemical relationships (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, neural responses to the tiled odor set (in which odor relationships are organized at intermediate chemical distances) reflected on-diagonal chemical relationships, but did not uniformly encode off-diagonal relationships.</s><s>For example, cortex appeared to emphasize chemical similarities between ketones and esters, while de-emphasizing chemical similarities between ketones and acids (see highlighted blue boxes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>).</s><s>Structured chemical-neural relationships were apparent on a trial-by-trial basis, and persisted for several seconds after odor offset; as has been observed previously under anesthesia, no spatial ordering of neurons was observed with respect to odor chemistry during wakefulness, consistent with response correlations alone conveying information about odor relationships (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Both UMAP embeddings and manifold alignment revealed that cortical odor relationships were similar across mice (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1e-f</ref>); indeed, information about pairwise cortical odor distances derived from one mouse could be used to predict the identity of a held-out odorant based upon odor distances measured in a different mouse, with better performance observed in L3 than L2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>Lasso optimization was used to identify chemical features relevant to driving neural responses in each of the odor sets; identified descriptors captured physiochemical features such as molecular weight, electronegativity, polarizability, and hydrophobicity, suggesting that ensemble-level odor representations are driven by diverse aspects of odor chemistry (SI Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Identified features that predicted neural activity for each odor set also improved the correspondence between all the other odor sets and their associated neural activity, demonstrating that information about odor chemistry gleaned from one experiment can be used to predict cortical responses in a different experiment carried out using a separate set of odorants (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The selective differences between odor chemical relationships and cortical activity apparent in the tiled odor experiment could reflect correlation structure present in OB inputs to PCx (consistent with feed-forward random network models), or instead could be generated by cortex (consistent with auto-associative models).</s><s>However, to date it has not been possible to quantify odor-evoked responses across the complete array of OB glomeruli, preventing characterization of correlations in bulb inputs to PCx.</s><s>We therefore introduced synapticallytargeted GCaMP6s into projection neurons spanning the OB, and imaged odor evoked activity in boutons in PCx layer 1a, where they synapse with L2 and L3 neurons; because the axons and boutons of all OB glomeruli are spatially distributed across the PCx <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , each cortical field of view effectively samples glomeruli from the entire bulb (see Methods, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Odors from the tiled odor set evoked both excitation and suppression in boutons, whose responses were similar across mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Correlation distance matrices revealed that bouton responses reflected information about odor chemical relationships (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>); in addition, identification of physiochemical features that optimized the observed chemical-bouton relationships improved predictions of bouton responses to held-out odors as well as predictions of cortical responses to the tiled odor set (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>, SI Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus -like cortex -OB projection neuron boutons encode information about odor relationships and chemistry.</s></p><p><s>However, odor responses in boutons and cortex exhibited distinct patterns of correlation with respect to chemistry, with the greatest differences observed in PCx L3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a-b</ref>).</s><s>While average levels of correlated activity were similar in boutons and cortex, the distributions of these correlations differed, with bouton representations exhibiting higher effective dimensionality; in contrast, PCx L3 odor responses were more clustered, more selectively structured, and exhibited both lower effective dimensionality and a wider dynamic range for representing close chemical relationships (Figs.</s><s>2a, 2c-e, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>The presence of these structured correlations in part reflected increased grouping of closelyrelated odorants, as representations for odors nearest each other in chemical space (i.e., ondiagonal correlation matrix relationships) were more clustered in cortex than in boutons (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">2f</ref>).</s><s>One exception to this trend were acids, which as a class were correlated in the OB but relatively decorrelated in cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Odor relationships were also reshaped in cortex compared to those in odor chemistry and boutons.</s><s>UMAP embeddings demonstrated that boutons largely organize odor information along a single axis that emphasizes chain length (again, with the exception of acids; see Methods); in contrast, odor information in PCx L3 was largely organized in two dimensions based on functional group (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>Similar functional group-based reorganization was observed via hierarchical clustering (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>).</s><s>Lasso optimization confirmed that boutons and cortex differentially weight chemical features related to chain length and functional group (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Moreover, several pairwise odor relationships were reorganized in cortex on the basis of both chain length and function group.</s><s>For example, in chemical space short-chain and longchain odors with different functional groups were similarly cross-correlated; in boutons correlations between short-chain aldehydes and esters were emphasized while those between long-chains were diminished; and, in PCx L3 the opposite pattern was observed, with longchain aldehydes and esters exhibiting stronger correlations and short-chains exhibiting weaker correlations (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>).</s><s>Chain-length dependent cortical reshaping of odor relationships was also apparent between aldehydes and ketones.</s></p><p><s>These differences in correlation structure suggest that PCx and boutons differentially encode information about odor identity and odor relationships.</s><s>Linear decoders based upon cortical responses (particularly from PCx L3) were worse than OB-based decoders at predicting odor identity on each trial, consistent with bouton odor responses having a higher dimensionality (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, cortex (particularly PCx L3) was on average better at encoding information about odor relationships (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>); notably, however, OB was better at generalizing across short-chain ketones, aldehydes and esters while cortex was better at generalizing across the corresponding long-chains, consistent with the observed differences in correlation structure for these odor classes (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>).</s><s>Given these differences in information content, we assessed whether bulbar or cortical odor codes more closely correspond to perceptual odor relationships by measuring the innate perceptual similarity of odor pairs through a cross-habituation assay (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Perceptual odor relationships better matched odor responses in PCx L3 than those in OB or PCx L2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d</ref>); this closer correspondence to PCx L3 was particularly apparent for the short-chain:short-chain and long-chain:long-chain comparisons whose neural correlation patterns were inverted in bulb and cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The transformation between bulb and cortex appears to reflect the combined influence of random network-type connectivity (which maintains odor relationships) and an autoassociative mechanism (which generally clusters and selectively reshapes odor relationships).</s><s>To directly assess the contribution of random network-type connectivity to the observed cortical odor responses, bouton odor responses were passed through a previouslyestablished feed-forward model in which simulated PCx neurons stochastically sample from multiple glomerular inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> (see Methods).</s><s>Consistent with previous reports, the model predicted decorrelated cortical odor representations whose pairwise relationships were preserved relative to boutons (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>While cortical responses were in part consistent with model output -as many pairwise odor relationships were preserved -the model failed to capture the strong correlation structure present in cortex or the selective rewriting of pairwise odor relationships (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">2a-e, 3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To evaluate the relative influence of auto-associative mechanisms on cortical odor representations, we used an AAV-based method to express tetanus toxin light chain (TeLC) within PCx neurons; this approach blocks synaptic transmission and causes PCx to behave as if it largely receives feed-forward inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>After attenuation of the associative network, single neuron odor tuning broadened, response densities rose, and odor correlations increased, consistent with known network-dependent recruitment of inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Critically, after TeLC infection, cortical odor relationships more closely resembled those present in odor chemistry and OB axonal boutons as assessed via correlation matrices, UMAP clustering and hierarchical clustering; for example, the cortical restructuring of short-chain and long-chain odor relationships was abolished, as was the decorrelation among acids (Figs. <ref type="figure">2a-c, 3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Auto-associative networks are predicted to influence correlations among odor representations to reflect the coincidence of stimuli in the world; while reward-based experiments have revealed task-dependent changes in cortical odor relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , it has not yet been demonstrated that cortical odor correlations are sensitive to passive odor experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>We therefore repeatedly exposed mice to a mixture of short-chain aldehydes and ketones (whose PCx L3 representations are relatively decorrelated, see Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) before assessing cortical responses to the tiled odor set.</s><s>Mixture experience specifically increased the cortical correlation between individual aldehydes and ketones and recruited single neuron tuning curves that reflected generalized responses to these specific odor classes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4e-f</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref>).</s><s>These observations demonstrate that cortical odor relationships can adapt to the statistics of the experienced odor environment.</s></p></div>

this re-writing is sensitive to odor exposure, which can recruit new single neuron tuning properties and modify odor relationships.</s><s>The olfactory system, therefore, transforms a chemical feature space into a cortical space that represents stimulus relationships through correlated activity;
