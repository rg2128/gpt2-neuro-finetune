<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The indirect 5-HT agonist dexfenfluramine (Redux) provided clinical proof of concept that pharmacological strategies that elevate 5-HT tone are an effective means to treat obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Guy-Grand et al, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Halford et al, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately its subsequent withdrawal owing to cardiac valvulopathy and pulmonary hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Connolly et al, 1997)</ref> highlighted clinical complications associated with the indiscriminate activation of this neurotransmitter system.</s><s>The 5-HT system comprises 14 distinct receptor subtypes organized into seven subclasses based on sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacology <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hoyer et al, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The 5-HT 2 subclass consists of three receptor subtypes, the 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , and 5-HT 2C subtypes, each sharing similar sequence homology and a preferential coupling to G q/11 to increase intracellular inositol phosphate and [Ca 2 + ] levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hoyer et al, 2002)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interest in the 5-HT 2C receptor as a potential target for treating obesity initially came from observations that selective 5-HT 2C receptor antagonists, such as <ref type="bibr">SB-242084 (6-chloro-5-methyl-1-[2-(2-methylpyridyl-3-oxy)</ref>-pyrid-5-yl carbomyl] indoline) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kennett et al, 1997)</ref>, block the anorectic effects of dexfenfluramine in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clifton et al, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vickers et al, 2001)</ref> and that 5-HT 2C receptordeficient mice show an attenuated response to dexfenfluramine <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Vickers et al, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>The cardiac valvulopathy associated with dexfenfluramine has since been attributed to activation of the 5-HT 2B receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fitzgerald et al, 2000)</ref>, which unlike the 5-HT 2C subtype is highly localized in cardiac tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Elangbam et al, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Because some hallucinogens, such as LSD, are 5-HT 2A receptor agonists, the identification of functionally selective 5-HT 2C agonists is of critical importance and a significant pharmaceutical challenge because of homology within the 5-HT 2 receptor subclass <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Nilsson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wacker and Miller, 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Lorcaserin ((1R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine HCl) has emerged as the most advanced drug of this class <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Thomsen et al, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Smith et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In functional assays using HEK-293 cells transiently expressing either h5-HT 2A , h5-HT 2B , or h5-HT 2C receptors, lorcaserin has agonist properties at each subtype, but importantly 100-fold functional selectivity for h2C vs h2B, and 15-fold functional selectivity for h2C vs h2A receptor subtypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Thomsen et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Lorcaserin reduces weight gain, food intake, and body fat mass in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Smith et al, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Thomsen et al, 2008)</ref>, and the anorectic effect of lorcaserin is absent in 5-HT 2C receptor-knockout (KO) mice <ref type="bibr">(Fletcher et al, 2009b)</ref>.</s><s>Clinical efficacy of lorcaserin to reduce body weight has been demonstrated in phase-II and III trials, with no evidence of cardiovascular signs indicative of valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension compared with placebo <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Smith et al, , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fidler et al, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, at therapeutic doses lorcaserin appears well tolerated, with no report of hallucinogenic activity or abuse liability <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Shram et al, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smith et al, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Smith et al, , 2010</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition to reducing feeding and body weight gain, 5-HT 2C receptor agonists also consistently reduce behaviors related to drug abuse.</s><s>Thus compounds such as Ro 60-0175, MK212, and WAY-163909 reduce self-administration of cocaine, ethanol, and nicotine <ref type="bibr">(Grottick et al, 2000</ref><ref

drug addiction: similar CNS circuitries mediate each behavior, both are outcomes of learned habits, which persist despite negative consequence, and both are heavily influenced by environmental stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Volkow and Wise, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kenny, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed it has been proposed that obesity, or at least the behavior that may cause it, be recognized as a mental disorder and included in the upcoming DSM-V, with diagnostic criteria modeled on those identified for substance abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Volkow and O'Brien, 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Nicotine dependence poses a significant global health burden, and identification of new pharmacotherapies to treat this condition is considered a major medical need particularly given the extremely favorable benefit-to-risk ratio after smoking cessation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Henningfield et al, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, given the clinical efficacy of lorcaserin in obesity and the observation that Ro 60-0175 reduces nicotine self-administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Grottick et al, 2001)</ref>, we investigated the effects of lorcaserin on nicotine self-administration and reinstatement of nicotine-seeking after extinction.</s><s>These experiments were complemented by an assessment of the effects of lorcaserin on nicotine-induced hyperactivity, and on the subjective effects of nicotine measured in a drug discrimination procedure.</s><s>Also because of positive associations between nicotine dependence and behavioral disinhibition, a process, which may promote continued nicotine seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bickel et al, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fields et al, 2009)</ref>, we examined the effect of lorcaserin on impulsive behavior induced by nicotine in the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Robbins, 2002)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, as lorcaserin has been developed to treat obesity, and preclinical information on this drug is limited, we first established its effects on food-motivated behaviors.</s><s>This was achieved by examining the effects of lorcaserin on feeding induced by deprivation and palatability.</s><s>The palatability test included a measurement of the behavioral satiety sequence (BSS) to examine the behavioral specificity of lorcaserin's effect on feeding (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rodgers et al, 2010</ref> for a recent review).</s><s>Additional tests examined the effect of lorcaserin on operant responding for food under an identical schedule of reinforcement to that used for nicotine.</s><s>Together these experiments represent a comparison between the effect of lorcaserin against nicotine and food-motivated behaviors.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The primary finding of these studies is that the selective 5-HT 2C receptor agonist lorcaserin reduced the stimulant, discriminative stimulus, and reinforcing properties of nicotine, as well as reinstatement of nicotine seeking, at doses that affected feeding behavior.</s><s>Lorcaserin also reduced a measure of nicotine-induced impulsive action.</s><s>While the effects on feeding behavior are consistent with the development of this drug as a treatment for obesity <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Smith et al, , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fidler et al, 2011)</ref>, the effects on nicotinerelated behaviors indicate an additional therapeutic potential for treating nicotine dependence.</s><s>The primary pharmacological property of lorcaserin is 5-HT 2C receptor activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Thomsen et al, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fletcher et al, 2009a, b)</ref>, and the demonstration that its effects on food-and nicotine-related behaviors were blocked by the selective 5-HT 2C antagonist SB-242084 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kennett et al, 1997)</ref> confirms this mechanism of action.</s></p><p><s>Despite its clinical status, there have been relatively few preclinical reports detailing the effect of lorcaserin in feeding tests, these being essentially limited to a study of cumulative food intake measured over 24 h, and 28-day studies in normal and DIO Levin rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Smith et al, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Thomsen et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The present studies extend this work by showing that lorcaserin reduced schedule-controlled responding for food under both PR and FR5 schedules, as well as feeding induced by palatability and 22 h food deprivation.</s><s>The effective dose range of lorcaserin in the present studies was consistent across all of these test situations and considerably lower than described in previous reports.</s><s>This is likely reflective of the route of drug administration (SC vs oral) and the duration of the test period: 1-2 h in the present studies compared with 24-h intake in prior studies, which necessitate a longer period of receptor occupancy.</s><s>Thus the current feeding studies were important for comparison with the effects of lorcaserin on nicotine discrimination, reinforcement, and reinstatement, which were run over similarly short test periods.</s></p><p><s>The outcomes from the feeding experiments suggest a behaviorally specific anorectic action of lorcaserin.</s><s>For example, the motivation to work for food reinforcement assessed by breakpoint on a PR schedule of availability, or 5-HT 2C agonist lorcaserin on nicotine-and food-motivated behavior under the FR5 schedule, was reduced at lorcaserin doses with no significant effects on rotorod performance.</s><s>Also the reduction in palatability-induced feeding at 1 mg/kg lorcaserin was associated with advancement of the BSS, further indicating a specificity to its anorectic effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Rodgers et al, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Similar findings have been reported for the 5-HT 2C agonists Ro 60-0175 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clifton et al, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hewitt et al, 2002)</ref> and VER23779 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Somerville et al, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>At 3 mg/kg, lorcaserin produced a more pronounced decrease in food intake, accompanied by an obvious disruption of the BSS, significant hypolocomotion, and impaired rotorod performance.</s><s>This likely reflects the more generalized motor disruption that can be produced by 5-HT 2C receptor agonists at higher doses (eg, <ref type="bibr">Grottick et al, 2000)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Having established doses that reliably affected feeding behavior, the primary objective of this study was to examine the effect of equivalent doses of lorcaserin on nicotineinduced behaviors.</s><s>Both nicotine-induced hyperactivity and self-administration were reduced by lorcaserin (0.3-1 mg/kg, SC) in an SB-242084 reversible manner.</s><s>A notable feature of the results of experiments involving food and nicotine reinforcement was that lorcaserin elicited similar reductions in responding for both reinforcers despite markedly differing response rates.</s><s>For example the response rate for food was approximately 10-15 times higher than the response rates for nicotine, yet at the 1-mg/kg dose lorcaserin reduced the number of reinforcers earned compared with the vehicle control by 36±5% for food and 54±7% for nicotine.</s></p><p><s>It is generally accepted that activation of nicotinic receptors, predominantly (but not exclusively) of the a 4 b 2 subtype, localized on multiple cell types within the VTA, is necessary for the stimulant and reinforcing

1992</ref><ref type="bibr">Corrigall et al, , 1994))</ref>, each being a result of nicotine eliciting a net shift toward excitation of the mesolimbic DA reward system <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mansvelder et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Keath et al, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Recent mapping studies detail a close overlap between nAchR and 5-HT 2C receptors within VTA subregions <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Zhao-Shea et al, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bubar and Cunningham, 2007)</ref> consistent with a potent inhibitory effect of systemically applied 5-HT 2C agonists on nicotine-induced increases in VTA cell firing and terminal DA release <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Pierucci et al, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Di Matteo et al, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently the property of lorcaserin to attenuate both the stimulant and reinforcing effects of nicotine likely arises from activation of 5-HT 2C receptors localized within the VTA.</s><s>It has also been proposed that the nicotinic a 4 b 2 partial agonist varenicline (CHANTIX) reduces nicotine self-administration through a functional dampening of nicotine's stimulatory effects on mesolimbic DA function at the level of the VTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Rollema et al, 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An additional action of nicotine that was affected by lorcaserin was its discriminative stimulus property.</s><s>Although lorcaserin did not engender nicotine appropriate responding, it did diminish the discriminative stimulus property of nicotine.</s><s>Similar findings have been reported for other 5-HT 2C receptor agonists, Ro 60-0175 and WAY-163909 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Quarta et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zaniewska et al, 2007)</ref>, confirming that 5-HT 2C receptor activation weakens the nicotine cue.</s><s>In contrast to the stimulant and reinforcing effects, the contribution of DA mechanisms to the discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine is less clear <ref type="bibr">(Corrigall and Coen, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Desai et al, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Smith and Stolerman, 2009)</ref>, and neuroanatomically sites distinct to the mesolimbic DA pathway appear to contribute to the cue, with nicotine infusions into the prefrontal cortex producing the most reliable generalization of the sites examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Miyata et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Smith and Stolerman, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently these findings are of interest from two perspectives.</s><s>First, they suggest an additional site beyond the VTA through which 5-HT 2C agonists may influence the behavioral effects of nicotine, and there is accumulating evidence that 5-HT 2C receptors localized within the frontal cortex may exert control over behaviors guided by other drugs of abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Filip and Cunningham, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pentkowski et al, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Second, because drug discrimination is measured as a percentage of drug vs non-drug responding, it represents a rate-free measure.</s><s>Thus the effect of lorcaserin (and other 5-HT 2C agonists) to attenuate a nicotine cue is not confounded by the effect of these drugs on response rate.</s></p><p><s>While the stimulant, discriminative stimulus, and reinforcing effects of nicotine likely contribute to the clinical state of nicotine dependence, assessment of potential treatment effects ideally should also include some measure of relapse prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Henningfield et al, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Nicotine dependence (tobacco smoking) is associated with high rates of relapse.</s><s>For example, it is estimated that only 20% of patients attempting to quit will remain abstinent for over a month, decreasing to 3% for over a year <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hughes et al, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Henningfield et al, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The reinstatement model of drug relapse is a frequently used animal model of this condition, notwithstanding debate about its construct validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Epstein et al, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Shaham et al, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Two main types of trigger for relapse in humans, and reinstatement in animals, are re-exposure to the drug and to cues associated 5-HT 2C agonist lorcaserin on nicotine-and food-motivated behavior with drug-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Shaham et al, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Given these two types of trigger and the multifactorial nature of cues associated with clinical nicotine dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Rose and Levin, 1991)</ref>, we chose to use a compound cue in the present studies, comprising a nicotine prime and light-tone CS previously paired with nicotine infusion.</s><s>Presentation of the nicotine prime plus cue stimulus reliably reinstated nicotine-seeking behavior, and lorcaserin significantly reduced this reinstatement at both the 0.3-and 1-mg/kg doses, in an SB-242084 reversible manner.</s><s>Interestingly, varenicline has been recently reported to reduce reinstatement to a nicotine cue and prime similar to that used in the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(O'Connor et al, 2010)</ref>, and clinically it has proven efficacious both in the context of smoking cessation and relapse prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gonzales et al, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Tonstad et al, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Clinical studies support a strong positive association between nicotine dependence and impulsive behavior (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bickel et al, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fields et al, 2009)</ref>, although the relationship between these two features, that is, cause or consequence, seems presently unclear.</s><s>Nevertheless, a deficit of inhibitory control can promote a vulnerability to continued drug usage and likelihood to relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pattij and Vanderschuren, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Winstanley et al, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Like many abused substances, nicotine will promote indices of impulsive action and choice in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Popke et al, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kolokotroni et al, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>For example, nicotine increases anticipatory (premature) responding in the 5-CSRTT <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Stolerman et al, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grottick and Higgins, 2000)</ref>, a measure of impulsive action, and conversely drug-naı ¨ve rats identified as 'impulsive' based on high premature response rates, subsequently showed enhanced motivation to selfadminister nicotine compared with their 'less impulsive' counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Diergaarde et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, nicotine reliably increased premature responding and lorcaserin (0.3-1 mg/kg) significantly reduced this measure to baseline levels, without significantly disrupting a principal measure of choice accuracy (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Quarta et al, 2007</ref> with respect to Ro 60-0175).</s><s>A feature of all 5-HT 2C agonists tested to date is that premature responding as measured in the 5-CSRTT is particularly sensitive to modulation by this class <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Quarta et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fletcher et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Navarra et al, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">present study)</ref>.</s><s>The small effects of lorcaserin (1 mg/kg) to increase omissions and response latencies may be partially attributable to its anorectic effects as they are qualitatively similar to those seen after prefeeding rats prior to the task (eg, <ref type="bibr">Grottick and Higgins, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Overall, the primary observation from this experiment is that lorcaserin reduced a measure of motor impulsivity elicited by nicotine, which in the context of the present studies, further supports its potential to treat nicotine dependence.</s></p><p><s>A potential complicating issue when interpreting the effects of selective 5-HT 2C receptor agonists, for example, lorcaserin (present study), CP-809101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Siuciak et al, 2007)</ref>, and WAY-161505 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hayes et al, 2009)</ref>, on behavior is their inhibitory effects on motor function <ref type="bibr">(Fletcher et al, 2009a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Halberstadt et al, 2009)</ref>, coupled with the anorectic effect of these drugs when using food reinforced operant procedures.</s><s>Therefore, a major issue in interpreting the effects on operant responding for food or nicotine, or in tests of reinstatement, is whether these just reflect motor impairment or sedation.</s><s>Our results provide multiple examples that this is unlikely, at least over the effective dose range 0.3-1 mg/kg.</s><s>First, lorcaserin-treated rats were not impaired on a forced motor task, the rotorod.</s><s>Second, in the food-reinforced operant conditioning tasks, the response rates of lorcaserin-treated rats were 10 to 15-fold higher than in rats responding for nicotine.</s><s>Therefore, an impaired capability to lever press cannot account for reduced responding in the self-administration and reinstatement experiments.</s><s>Third, lorcaserin-treated rats performed consistently and accurately on the five-choice serial reaction time test, which involves a sustained series of rapid coordinated motor responses and cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Robbins, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>On average, rats tested with lorcaserin responded to the light stimulus only marginally slower than under control conditions.</s><s>Similarly the normal BSS was also retained in the palatability feeding test.</s><s>Fourth, on the drug discrimination test, the effect of lorcaserin to alter the discriminative stimulus properties of nicotine was independent of changes in response rate.</s><s>Finally, and most significantly, clinical experience with lorcaserin suggests it to be well tolerated at efficacious doses in phase II/III obesity trials, with no increased incidence in detrimental motor signs such as sedation compared with placebo <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Smith et al, , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fidler et al, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Shram et al 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The similarity in dose (and likely plasma exposure) seen in the preclinical feeding-and nicotine-based studies would support that an equivalent dosage is necessary to evaluate lorcaserin in smoking cessation trials as that used in obesity trials.</s><s>Taken together, with careful dose selection, the sedative effects of lorcaserin do not appear to be an issue in the clinic and do not provide a reasonable explanation for the findings described in the present reportFat least up to doses of 1 mg/kg.</s><s>Interestingly, at supratherapeutic doses of lorcaserin (40-60 mg), clinical measures of dislike (eg, headache, nausea) are frequently reported by study subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Shram et al, 2011)</ref> and this may be reflected by the behavioral disruption seen in the present study after a subcutaneous (SC) dose of 3 mg/kg.</s></p><p><s>A prominent hypothesis for the anorectic properties of 5-HT 2C agonists and (dex)fenfluramine is that these agents activate 5-HT 2C receptors localized on pro-opioid melanocortin (POMC) neurones located within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.</s><s>As these cells are also responsive to a variety of peripheral metabolic signals such as leptin and insulin, 5-HT 2C agonists directly modulate this circuitry important in the regulation of energy balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Heisler et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cone, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>However, given the effects of 5-HT 2C receptor agonists on motivated behaviors that are driven by a wide range of reinforcers (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Higgins and Fletcher, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cunningham et al, 2011)</ref>, and the observation that the anorectic effects of fenfluramine and the non-selective 5-HT 2C agonist TFMPP remain evident in rats with hypothalamic lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fletcher et al, 1993)</ref>, a second plausible locus is through 5-HT 2C -mediated regulation of forebrain systems, including the DA mesolimbic pathway.</s><s>Given the complexity and redundancy of mechanisms that directly control ingestive behavior, such a dual mechanism of action could be advantageous when considering this drug class as treatments for obesity.</s><s>Indeed the observation that lorcaserin appears to similarly affect feeding induced by deprivation (likely driven by metabolic signals in response to energy demand) and palatability (likely driven by reward related processes) is consistent with such a dual hypothesis.</s><s>Similarly the property of lorcaserin to reduce the stimulant, cueing, and reinforcing effects of nicotine, and the reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior, suggests the therapeutic potential of lorcaserin, and 5-HT 2C agonists, in general, might further extend into the treatment of addictive behaviors such as nicotine dependence <ref type="bibr">(Fletcher et al, 2009a)</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
