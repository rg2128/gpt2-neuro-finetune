<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>Participants were asked to perform a modification of the task developed by Posner for examining covert shifts of spatial attention (Posner 1980) while undergoing fMRI in hungry and satiated states which were counterbalanced across participants.</s><s>While performing the task, participants were asked to fixate on a central diamond (1°wide) that remained on the screen for the complete duration of the task.</s><s>They were instructed to respond to the onset of peripherally presented donuts or hex-nuts (targets) and danishes or screws (foils) by pressing a button (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>To ensure that participants attended to the stimuli, they were instructed to press the left-hand button for foils and the right-hand button for target images.</s><s>All food and tool stimuli were obtained from commercially available images, and were formatted to the same resolution and size.</s><s>Each trial began with a darkening of one side or the entire central diamond, which provided an alerting directional or nondirectional cue respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>This cue remained on the screen until the appearance of the target stimulus to avoid engaging working memory.</s><s>Three different lengths of delay (or stimulus asynchrony, SOA of 200, 400, and 800 ms) between cue and target presentation were employed to maximize attentional demands and prevent temporal predictability.</s><s>Following this delay, targets or foils appeared in 1 of 2 peripheral squares (on the right and left of the diamond, each 1.5°wide) centered at 7.5°from the central diamond for 100 ms, on the side indicated by the directional cue (valid trial), on the opposite side (invalid trial), and on either side of the nondirectional cues (nondirectional trial).</s><s>The total intertrial interval varied as a function of SOA such that each trial totaled 2200 ms <ref type="bibr">(i.e., 2000, 1800, and 1600 ms)</ref>.</s><s>Null events or time periods when the screen remained blank, were interspersed with target events to allow deconvolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burock et al. 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Null events lasted 1000 ms and up to 3 could occur consecutively.</s><s>Half of the trials in each run were comprised of null events.</s></p><p><s>Each participant was imaged as they performed the task in 2 experimental sessions, once while hungry and once while satiated on donuts.</s><s>The 2 experimental sessions were held 1 week apart and their order was counterbalanced across subjects.</s><s>All participants were instructed not to eat food for at least 8 h prior to the fMRI session.</s><s>Ratings of hunger and appetitiveness of all target stimuli were obtained prior to each experimental session.</s><s>To manipulate the motivational salience of the food stimuli, subjects were informed that they would be given 1 donut following testing in the hunger condition and were allowed to consume as many donuts as they could before testing in the satiated condition.</s><s>In the scanner, the participants viewed the task via a mirror attached to the head coil.</s><s>Using a liquid crystal display projector attached to the stimulus presentation computer, stimuli were back-projected onto translucent screen that the participants viewed through a mirror.</s></p><p><s>Participants performed a total of 6 randomly presented runs in each experimental session.</s><s>Within each run, the task was implemented as a mixed event-related design by presenting the food and tool trials in separate blocks.</s><s>This was done in order to avoid introducing the additional factor of deciding whether the stimuli were foods or tools.</s><s>An image saying ''FOOD'' or ''TOOLS'' appeared at the beginning of each block for 1000 ms to cue subjects on the block type.</s><s>Each run consisted of 6 randomly presented blocks, 3 food blocks and 3 tool blocks.</s><s>Overall, each experimental run consisted of 216 trials (90% targets and 10% foils) out of which, 60% were valid trials, 15% were invalid trials, and 25% were nondirectional trials.</s></p></div>

RT for that particular session.</s><s>The cue benefit scores, which are measures of the speed of attentional shifts to the food or tool-related targets, were used to predict variations in the HRF during the validly cued trials.</s></p><p><s>Image Processing and Analyses fMRI data were analyzed using the SPM2 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) running under the MATLAB environment (Mathworks, Inc., Sherborn, MA).</s><s>Functional images for each participant were corrected for slice timing, realigned for correction of motion artifacts, coregistered to that participant's high-resolution anatomical T 1 image, spatially normalized, using the EPI template provided in SPM2, into a standard anatomical space ) that approximately conforms to the atlas of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Talairach and Tournoux (1988)</ref> and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full width half maximum = 7 mm).</s><s>Runs with more than 1 voxel of scan-to-scan movement were excluded from further analysis.</s></p><p><s>For each subject, a canonical HRF approximating the temporal course of the BOLD HRF to valid, invalid, and nondirectionally cued food and tool targets was modeled separately for the hungry and satiated sessions.</s><s>The temporal derivative of the HRF was included to accommodate temporal variability in the HRF function across brain areas and participants.</s><s>This model yielded a per-voxel parameter estimate (b) map representing the magnitude of activation associated with each trial type.</s><s>Null trials were not modeled explicitly and contributed to the implicit baseline.</s><s>The design also included a 128 sec high-pass filter and an AR(1) model to account for temporal nonsphericity due to autocorrelations.</s></p><p><s>The fMRI data were first examined to determine brain regions that are involved in encoding motivational salience (level 1).</s><s>These regions were expected to show selective sensitivity to food-related cues when hungry but not when satiated, an effect that would not generalize to tools.</s><s>For each subject, statistical comparisons between different trial types were conducted by comparing the corresponding b maps using linear contrasts.</s><s>To contrast activation for food versus tool targets in the hungry versus satiated state, corresponding b maps from validly cued trials were subjected to a double subtraction procedure resulting in a [(hungry food -full food) -(hungry tools -full tools)] statistical parameter (SPM) t map for each subject.</s><s>This procedure is statistically equivalent to motivational state by target type, within-subject interaction.</s><s>Finally, the [(hungry food -full food) -(hungry tools -full tools)] linear contrast images computed at the individual subject level were forwarded to a second-level random-effects analysis to examine the effect of motivational state (hungry and full) on neural responses to directional cues indicating food-and tool-related targets.</s></p><p><s>Next, we examined brain regions that mediate motivational modulation of anticipatory spatial attention in a material-specific manner (level 2).</s><s>For this purpose, another model was estimated to examine brain areas whose activity was associated significantly with cue benefit scores.</s><s>This model was identical to the one outlined above except for the addition of a condition specific regressor that modeled the benefit scores derived from the cues as a continuous factor.</s><s>This regressor allowed us to identify voxels that specifically show a significant correlation with cue benefit scores on validly cued trials.</s><s>The calculation of the cue benefit scores is described in the behavioral analyses section above.</s><s>To examine how motivational state altered the correlation between neural activity and the speed of attentional shifts differentially to food versus tool targets we subjected the b maps denoting correlation between cue benefit scores and brain activity for validly cued trials to the double subtraction procedure outlined above.</s><s>This double subtraction procedure resulted in a [(hungry food -full food) -(hungry tools -full tools)] SPM t map for each subject.</s><s>These maps were forwarded to a second-level random-effects analysis to examine the effect of motivational state (hungry and full) on the correlation between cue benefit scores and neural responses to directional cues indicating food-and tool-related targets.</s></p><p><s>Because we had specific a priori hypotheses regarding the role of limbic regions (e.g., amygdala and PC) in encoding of motivational valence (level 1) and the role of spatial attention network (e.g., PC, PPC/IPS, FEF) in biasing spatial attention (level 2), we conducted a region of interest (ROI) analyses.</s><s>Search volumes for the ROI analyses were restricted within a 6--10 mm radius of coordinates for amygdala (±21, -3, -27), PC (±21, -39, 36; ±9, -39, 24), PPC/IPS (±21, --60, 51; ±27, -60, 57), FEF (±27, -6, 42; ±51, 0, 36), medial OFC (MOFC) (±18, 25, -18), and lateral OFC (LOFC) (±41, 34, -19) that were derived from earlier studies conducted in our labs, from contrasts most relevant to the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gitelman et al. 1999;</ref><ref

reported.</s><s>In addition, to examine regions other than those identified by the ROI analyses, we conducted an exploratory whole-brain analyses by using a statistical threshold of P &lt; 0.005, uncorrected and a cluster threshold of greater than 6 voxels.</s><s>Finally, the pattern of activation in regions identified as being above threshold in the ROI and whole-brain analyses outlined above was examined in greater detail.</s><s>This was done by extracting signal time courses and calculating the spatially averaged percent signal change or parameter estimate for each condition from each activation cluster using the Marsbar toolbox (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/).</s><s>SPSS was then used to examine the simple effects driving the interaction confirmed by whole-brain and ROI analyses.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we examined the task-dependent changes in connectivity that linked the 2 levels using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses.</s><s>The PC, which has been shown to be involved in anticipatory biasing of spatial attention to motivationally relevant events <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Small et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Small et al. , 2005))</ref>, served as a seed region from the first level.</s><s>For PPI, the deconvolved time-series data for PC was extracted from each participants normalized data, based on a sphere of radius 6 mm around the peak activation voxel from the group analyses.</s><s>The product of this activation time-series data and the psychological vector of interest (hungry food -full food) resulted in the PPI term.</s><s>New SPMs with the physiological variable (PC activity), psychological variable, and their interaction as regressors were computed for each subject.</s><s>These subject level PPI SPMs were then entered into a random-effects group analyses using a t-test within functional parietal and OFC ROIs where motivational state differentially altered the relationship between neural activity and speed of attentional shifts toward food compared with toolrelated targets and results were thresholded at P &lt; 0.05 (uncorrected) with a cluster size of &gt;6 contiguous voxels.</s></p></div>
