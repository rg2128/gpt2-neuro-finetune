monitored daily and maintained at 85% of their original weight.</s><s>Mice were trained in cohorts of three.</s><s>All behavioral procedures were performed during the light hours.</s><s>Head-fixed mice were trained on a lick/no-lick odor discrimination task across multiple 1 h recording sessions in which the mice obtained a 4 l water reward for licking a spout positioned in front of their snouts in trials with reinforced odors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A-C</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Verhagen et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Licking was measured by a pair of infrared photobeams positioned to cross in front of the lick spout by ϳ2 mm.</s><s>Mice were first trained to lick the water spout for reward (Phase 1) and then were rewarded for licking only during odor presentation (Phase 2, always rewarded odor trials), with a progressively increasing intertrial interval.</s><s>In Phase 3, trials were randomized between rewarded and unrewarded trials; for unrewarded odor trials, mice were presented with a "blank" stimulus (mineral oil) and had to learn to withhold licking during these trials.</s><s>Finally, in Phase 4, trials were randomized between the rewarded and unrewarded odor as in the experimental sessions.</s><s>In go trials, mice would receive a reward for licking a spout during the rewarded odor (hit), otherwise the trial would be considered a miss.</s><s>In no-go trials, mice were presented with an unreinforced odor and did not receive a water reward regardless of whether they licked (false alarm) or correctly withheld licking for the total odor duration of the trial (correct reject).</s><s>Behavioral performance was evaluated in blocks of 20 trials, and mice were required to achieve a performance criterion of Ն85% correct for two consecutive blocks to advance to the next phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2C</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Verhagen et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>OT activity was recorded

behavioral tasks, in the following order: odor discrimination, binary odor mixture discrimination, and reversal learning.</s><s>For odor discrimination sessions (n ϭ 52 sessions total), 16 mice had extensive training with an odor pair, as evidenced by high behavioral performance (Ն80% correct).</s><s>One mouse did not yield any well isolated neurons during this task.</s><s>Analyses for this task type included responses to the original odor pair used during the training phases, as well as novel odor pairs that were learned in a later session (see below).</s><s>In binary odor mixture discrimination sessions (n ϭ 25 sessions total), task difficulty was increased for 13 mice by using binary mixtures of the rewarded and unrewarded odors <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Uchida and Mainen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abraham et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>The first cohort of mice (n ϭ 3) did not participate in a binary odor mixture discrimination task.</s><s>Binary mixtures were presented at ratios of 80% rewarded to 20% unrewarded (in the liquid state).</s><s>One mouse did not reach adequate behavioral performance levels in the mixture discrimination task.</s><s>For reversal learning sessions (n ϭ 17 sessions total), 16 mice were presented with the original odor discrimination pair for two blocks, after which the odor contingencies were reversed and successful reversal learning was acquired within the same day.</s><s>Two mice did not yield well isolated neurons during the reversal learning task, and a third mouse did not reach criterion

per mouse were performed for the original discrimination task, and one to three sessions per mouse for the binary mixture and reversal tasks.</s></p><p><s>Stimulus delivery.</s><s>Odors were presented through a custom air dilution olfactometer with independent stimulus lines up to the point of entry into the odor port.</s><s>In addition to a blank stimulus (mineral oil), odors included isopentyl acetate, ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, heptanal, (Ϫ)-limonene, 2-heptanone, 2-butanone, and 1,7-octadiene (Sigma-Aldrich; all Ͼ97% purity).</s><s>These molecularly diverse odors were diluted in their liquid state to 1 torr (133.32</s><s>Pa) in mineral oil and were then further diluted to 10% (v/v) by mixing 100 ml of odor vaporized N 2 with 900 ml of medical grade N 2 (Airgas).</s><s>Thus, stimuli were delivered at a total flow rate of 1 L/min.</s><s>Not all animals were tested with all odors.</s><s>The rewarded and unrewarded odor pairs were pseudo-randomly assigned to each cohort before training (neurons were not initially screened for odor responsiveness).</s><s>The experimenter was not blind to odor assignment, but all stimulus presentation was automated.</s><s>Rewarded and unrewarded odors were pseudo-randomized within each block, and presented for 2 s duration with a 25 Ϯ 2 s intertrial interval through a Teflon odor port (9-mm-diameter opening) directed toward the snout of the animal at a distance of 1 cm.</s><s>Odor was continuously flowing to the odor port but was removed by a vacuum before exiting toward the animal.</s><s>Recordings with a photoionization detector (PID; miniPID, Aurora Scientific) were used to confirm the temporal dynamics of the odor presentation in this design.</s><s>When a single test stimulus (1,7-octadiene, diluted and presented as described above) was presented eight times, the average evoked PID response reached 10% and 50% of maximum response at ϳ110 and 120 ms, respectively, relative to vacuum offset (odor onset; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2B</ref>).</s><s>The intensity of the odor was relatively stable throughout the duration of the 2 s presentation (Ϯ3% of the mean).</s><s>Further, odor removal was rapid, with a prompt return of the PID response to Ͻ10% of the maximum response following vacuum onset (odor offset).</s><s>While these dynamics may vary slightly across odors, these measures illustrate the precision and stability of the odor presentation methods used in this study.</s></p><p><s>In vivo electrophysiology.</s><s>The output of the electrode array was amplified, digitized at 24.4 kHz, filtered (bandpass filter, 300 -5000 Hz), and monitored (Tucker-Davis Technologies), along with respiration (bandpass filter, 1-10 Hz; 100 Hz sampling rate), licking (300 Hz sampling rate), and odor presentation events.</s><s>One electrode wire was selected to serve as a local reference.</s><s>To aid behavioral shaping, sniffing was monitored in eight animals by recording intranasal pressure by connecting the implanted nasal cannula to a pressure sensor (Honeywell) via polyethylene tubing <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wesson et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>No attempt was made to analyze data relative to the respiratory cycle among these animals due to a limited number of experimental sessions with a robust sniffing signal.</s><s>Given the small dorsal-ventral extent of the OT (ϳ300 m), our electrode arrays were fixed in place, and no attempt was made to record from unique populations of neurons on different sessions.</s><s>Indeed, it is possible that the same neuron was recorded across multiple days.</s><s>To compensate for this potential bias, the three different behavioral tasks and/or novel odor pairs were used, and statistical comparisons were made only within each task type.</s><s>Sessions of the same task and odor pair were run for 1-3 consecutive days to achieve adequate behavioral performance and/or capture the dynamics of newly identified neurons.</s><s>Examination of the average spike waveform confirmed that 89% of the analyzed neurons represent a unique neuron-odor pair.</s><s>On average, 3.1 Ϯ 1.4 single neurons were recorded per mouse per session (range, one to seven neurons), with an average of 2.2 Ϯ 1.6 neurons recorded per viable electrode wire per mouse per session.</s><s>After all recording sessions were completed (between 10 and 30 d), mice were given (intraperitoneally) an overdose of urethane and were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline and 10% formalin, and brains stored in 30% sucrose formalin at 4°C.</s><s>OT recording sites were verified by histological examinations of slide-mounted, 40 m coronal sections stained with a 1% cresyl violet solution (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Analysis of odor-evoked activity.</s><s>Single neurons were sorted off-line in Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design), using a combination of template matching and cluster cutting based on principal component analysis.</s><s>Single neurons were further defined as having Ͻ2% of the spikes occurring within a refractory period of 2 ms.</s><s>Spike times associated with each odor were extracted and exported to MATLAB (MathWorks) for further analysis.</s><s>To examine modulations in firing rate within a single trial, spike density functions were calculated by convolving spike trains with a function resembling a postsynaptic potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Thompson et al., 1996)</ref>.</s><s>Mean firing rates across trials were measured in 50 ms bins, along with the 95% confidence intervals.</s><s>The mean baseline firing rate for each neuron was averaged across the 2 s before odor onset.</s><s>Neurons were considered task-responsive if two consecutive bins within a 7 s period from odor onset were significantly different from the baseline rate, having nonoverlapping confidence intervals.</s><s>This liberal 7 s window size was chosen to capture any modulation in firing rate that may be related to odor presentation, licking behavior, and/or reward ingestion.</s><s>Notably, our results are not dependent on the size of this window.</s><s>Indeed, almost all responsive neurons in the odor discrimination task (164 of 165 neurons) are also task responsive within a 2 s period from odor onset.</s></p><p><s>Animals were typically presented with 40 trials of a single rewarded and unrewarded odor set per session.</s><s>To ensure that animals were attending to the task, only blocks possessing high behavioral performance were analyzed for odor discrimination and reversal learning sessions.</s><s>For the binary odor mixture discrimination task, all blocks were analyzed regardless of performance due to the increased task difficulty and the need for comparing correct and error trials.</s><s>All performed tests were two sided and met assumptions of normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).</s><s>Sample sizes are consistent with numbers reported in the field, and no statistical method was used to predetermine these.</s><s>Statistical analyses were performed in StatView (SAS Institute) or MATLAB.</s><s>All data are reported as the mean Ϯ SEM, unless otherwise noted.</s></p><p><s>Receiver operating characteristic analysis.</s><s>The area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) is a nonparametric measure of the discriminability of two distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Green and Swets, 1966)</ref>.</s><s>To normalize peristimulus time histograms across neurons, we used an auROC method that quantifies stimulusrelated changes in firing rate to the baseline activity on a 0 -1 scale (for more details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cohen et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>A value of 0.5 indicates completely overlapping distributions, whereas values of 0 or 1 signal perfect discriminability.</s><s>Using a sliding ROC analysis, we calculated the auROC at each time bin (window size 50 ms, advanced in 10 ms steps) over a 7 s period from stimulus onset.</s><s>Values Ͼ0.5 indicate the probability that firing rates were increased relative to baseline, whereas values Ͻ0.5 indicate the probability that firing rates were decreased relative to baseline.</s><s>The firing rate distributions of correct trials typically contained 20 -40 trials per odor (range, 7-61), except for error trial distributions, which required a minimum of only 5 trials and typically contained 6 -25 trials (range, 5-48).</s><s>Similar trial numbers have been used for calculating auROC <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Veit and Nieder, 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate odor selectivity, auROC was used to measure the discriminability of the firing rate distributions of the rewarded and unrewarded odor (the unrewarded odor was set as the reference distribution).</s><s>In this case, values Ͼ0.5 indicate increases in firing for the rewarded odor relative to unrewarded odor ("rewarded odor preference"), whereas values Ͻ0.5 indicated higher firing rates for the unrewarded odor ("unrewarded odor preference").</s><s>A permutation test was used to create a null distribution of auROC values ϳ0.5, where the trial labels "rewarded" and "unrewarded' were randomly reassigned and calculated 1000 times.</s><s>Significant auROC bins were determined by testing whether the actual auROC value was outside the 95% confidence interval of this null distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Veit and Nieder, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>A neuron was considered "odor selective" (increased firing rates for one odor over the other) if there were at least two consecutive significant auROC bins from odor onset to the average be-havioral response within the session, which was defined as 75 ms before the recorded lick onset to adjust for motor responses leading up to lick detection.</s><s>Odor-selective neurons that preferentially fired in response to the rewarded odor had significant auROC values (Ͼ0.5), whereas neu- rons preferentially firing for the unrewarded odor had significant auROC values (Ͻ0.5).</s><s>The same procedure was used for determining trial response selectivity, except in those cases where firing rate distributions were defined by the behavioral response and required the following three comparisons: hit versus correct reject, false alarm versus correct reject, and hit versus false alarm.</s><s>Population auROC odor comparisons were made by first averaging values across a 200 ms window before average lick onset for each neuron, and then running a paired t test.</s><s>To test the strength of discriminability, auROC magnitudes before lick onset for all task-responsive neurons were assessed by first subtracting the auROC value for neurons with "unrewarded odor preference" from 1, so that both distributions ranged from 0.5 to 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Veit and Nieder, 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the potential influence of licking on the measured neural responses, we tested whether our results were dependent on the inclusion of trials with early lick onsets (those occurring Յ200 ms from odor onset).</s><s>Responses were then compared when spike times were aligned to lick onset for each rewarded trial.</s><s>For this analysis, baseline firing rates were measured from Ϫ4 to Ϫ2 s relative to onset.</s><s>The slope of the initial rise in auROC values was measured from 10% to 90% of the maximum auROC value.</s></p></div>
