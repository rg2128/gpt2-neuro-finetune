target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Deciphering the molecular networks that distinguish organ-confined disease from metastatic disease may lead to the identification of critical biomarkers for cancer invasion and disease aggressiveness.</s><s>Although gene and protein expression have been extensively profiled in human tumours, little is known about the global metabolomic alterations that characterize neoplastic progression.</s><s>Using a combination of high-throughput liquid-and-gas-chromatography-based mass spectrometry, we profiled more than 1,126 metabolites across 262 clinical samples related to prostate cancer (42 tissues and 110 each of urine and plasma).</s><s>These unbiased metabolomic profiles were able to distinguish benign prostate, clinically localized prostate cancer and metastatic disease.</s><s>Sarcosine, an N-methyl derivative of the amino acid glycine, was identified as a differential metabolite that was highly increased during prostate cancer progression to metastasis and can be detected non-invasively in urine.</s><s>Sarcosine levels were also increased in invasive prostate cancer cell lines relative to benign prostate epithelial cells.</s><s>Knockdown of glycine-N-methyl transferase, the enzyme that generates sarcosine from glycine, attenuated prostate cancer invasion.</s><s>Addition of exogenous sarcosine or knockdown of the enzyme that leads to sarcosine degradation, sarcosine dehydrogenase, induced an invasive phenotype in benign prostate epithelial cells.</s><s>Androgen receptor and the ERG gene fusion product coordinately regulate components of the sarcosine pathway.</s><s>Here, by profiling the metabolomic alterations of prostate cancer progression, we reveal sarcosine as a potentially important metabolic intermediary of cancer cell invasion and aggressivity.</s></p><p><s>To profile the 'metabolome' during prostate cancer progression, we used both liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> to interrogate the relative levels of metabolites across 262 prostate-related biospecimens (outlined in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, 42 tissue samples and 110 matched specimens of plasma and post-digital-rectal-exam urine from biopsy-positive cancer patients (n 5 59) and biopsy-negative control individuals (n 5 51) were assayed (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>A total of 1,126 metabolites were quantified and, as expected, only a small percentage of these metabolites (15.6%) were shared across the disparate biospecimen types (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Evaluation of the unbiased metabolomic profiles of plasma or urine did not identify robust differences between biopsy-positive and -negative individuals.</s><s>For plasma, 20 out of 478 (4%) metabolites were differential (Wilcoxon P , 0.05), with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 99%.</s><s>Likewise, for urine, 36 out of 583 (6%) metabolites were differential (Wilcoxon P , 0.05), with an FDR of 67%.</s><s>Thus, our initial focus was directed towards understanding the tissue metabolomic profiles as they showed more robust alterations.</s></p><p><s>Tissue samples were derived from benign adjacent prostate (n 5 16), clinically localized prostate cancer (n 5 12, PCA) and metastatic prostate cancer (n 5 14) patients.</s><s>Selection of metastatic tissue samples from different sites (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) minimized characterization of analytes specific to cells of non-prostatic origin.</s><s>In total, high-throughput profiling of the tissues quantitatively detected 626 metabolites (175 named, 19 isobars and 432 metabolites without identification), of which 82.3% (515 out of 626) were shared by the three diagnostic classes (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</s><s>Notably, there were 60 metabolites found in PCA and/or metastatic tumours but not in benign prostate.</s><s>These profiles were displayed as a heat map (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) and z-score plot (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>).</s><s>In the latter, benign-based z-scores were plotted for each of the 626 metabolites.</s><s>The plots revealed robust metabolic alterations in metastatic tumours (z-score range: 213.6 to 81.9) compared to fewer changes in clinically localized prostate cancer samples (z-score range: 27.7 to 45.8).</s></p><p><s>We identified the differential metabolites between the PCA and benign samples using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test coupled with a permutation test (n 5 1,000).</s><s>A total of 87 out of 518 metabolites were differential across these two classes (P , 0.05, corresponding to a 23% FDR).</s><s>For visualizing the relationship between the 87 altered metabolites, hierarchical clustering was used to arrange the metabolites on the basis of their relative levels across samples (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Among the perturbed metabolites, 50 were increased in PCA samples whereas 37 were downregulated.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> displays the relative levels of the 37 named metabolites that were differential between benign prostate and PCA samples.</s><s>Similarly, 124 out of 518 metabolites were found to be increased in the metastatic samples compared to

Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">7</ref> and<ref type="table">8</ref>).</s><s>The overall receiver operating characteristic curves for sarcosine indicate that its predictive value is modest, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 for urine sediments and 0.67 for supernatants (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">14b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Notably, an AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect prediction and an AUC of 0.5 indicates prediction equivalent to random selection.</s><s>When restricted to samples having PSA in the clinical grey zone of 2-10 ng ml 21 (n 5 53), sarcosine performed better than PSA in delineating the two diagnostic classes with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.84) compared to an AUC of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.69) for PSA (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">15</ref>).</s><s>Thus, sarcosine may have the potential to identify patients with modestly increased PSA that are likely to have a positive prostate biopsy.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether the sarcosine increase in prostate cancer has biological relevance, we measured its levels in prostate cancer cell lines VCaP, DU145, 22RV1 and LNCaP (n 5 3 each) as well as in their benign epithelial counterparts, primary benign prostate epithelial cells (PrEC, n 5 2) and immortalized benign RWPE prostate cells (n 5 3).</s><s>Significantly increased levels of the metabolite were found in prostate cancer cells compared to the benign cells (analysis of variance, ANOVA, P 5 0.0218, Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, sarcosine levels correlated well with cell invasiveness (Spearman's correlation coefficient: 0.943, P 5 0.0048).</s><s>On the basis of our earlier findings that EZH2 overexpression in benign cells could mediate cell invasion and neoplastic progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , sarcosine levels were assessed on modulation of EZH2 expression.</s><s>Interestingly, overexpression of EZH2 in benign prostate epithelial cells increased sarcosine levels (4.5-fold, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">16a</ref>), whereas its knockdown in DU145 prostate cancer cells diminished the levels of the metabolite (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">16a-c</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether sarcosine has a more direct role in this process, we added the metabolite to non-invasive benign prostate epithelial cells.</s><s>Alanine, an isomer of sarcosine, was used as a control for these experiments.</s><s>Remarkably, the mere addition of exogenous sarcosine imparted an invasive phenotype to benign prostate epithelial cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the number of motile prostate epithelial cells was significantly higher on sarcosine treatment (t-test P 5 6.997 3 10 26 , n 5 10) compared to alaninetreated controls (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">18</ref>).</s><s>Sarcosine treatment, however, did not affect the ability of these cells to progress through the different stages of cell cycle (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">19a-d</ref>) or impair cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">19e</ref>).</s><s>Notably, glycine, a precursor of sarcosine, induced invasion in these cells, although to a lesser degree than sarcosine (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>).</s><s>This invasion could result from the conversion of glycine to sarcosine by the enzyme glycine-N-methyltransferase (GNMT; Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition to GNMT, sarcosine levels are regulated by sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH), the enzyme that converts sarcosine back to glycine, and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH), which generates sarcosine from dimethylglycine (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>By virtue of their ability to control sarcosine levels in cells, these enzymes may assume a critical role in modulating prostate cancer invasion.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, a series of RNA-interference-mediated knockdown experiments were carried out.</s><s>Attenuation of GNMT (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref>) in DU145 prostate cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in cell invasion (t-test P 5 0.0073, n 5 3), with a concomitant threefold decrease in the intracellular sarcosine levels compared to control non-target short interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected cells.</s><s>Similar knockdown experiments performed in benign RWPE cells significantly hampered the ability of exogenous glycine (t-test P 5 0.0082, n 5 3), but not sarcosine, to induce invasion (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">21a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Comparable loss of cell invasion and reduction in sarcosine levels were also apparent in DU145 cancer cells on knockdown of DMGDH (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">22a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, knockdown of SARDH in benign prostate epithelial cells resulted in an ,3-fold increase in endogenous sarcosine levels with a concomitant .3.5-fold increase in invasion (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref>).</s></p><p><s>With the understanding that androgen signalling and ETS family of genes (ERG, ETV1) fusions are key factors for prostate cancer progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , we investigated their role in regulating GNMT and SARDH.</s><s>Treatment with androgen for 48 h in VCaP (ERG-positive) and LNCaP (ETV1-positive) prostate cancer cells resulted in a stepwise increase in GNMT expression and a concomitant decrease in SARDH levels, as assessed by digital gene expression and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">25e</ref>).</s><s>This finding was supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChiP-Seq), which revealed direct binding of androgen receptor and ERG to the promoter of GNMT in VCaP cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">4e</ref>), whereas only ERG binding was seen on the SARDH promoter (Fig. <ref type="figure">4f</ref>).</s><s>In ETV1-positive LNCaP cells, androgen receptor, but not ERG as expected, was bound to both GNMT and SARDH promoters (Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure">25a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>The binding data were validated by ChIP-PCR (Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure">24a, b, d</ref> and<ref type="figure">25c, d</ref>), which additionally revealed weak binding of androgen receptor to the SARDH promoter in VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">24c</ref>).</s><s>These findings together directly link activation of the sarcosine pathway to androgen receptor and ETS gene fusion regulation-two key mediators of prostate cancer progression.</s><s>Remarkably, both ERG-and ETV1-induced invasion were associated with a threefold sarcosine increase in benign RWPE cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">4g</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, knockdown of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">26</ref>)</s></p></div>
