<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Mouse behavior in a probabilistic foraging task.</s><s>To study the role of 5-HT in foraging mice, we developed a novel probabilistic foraging task.</s><s>Water-restricted mice were placed in a rectangular chamber (50 cm long) containing one water port at each end, which acted as foraging sites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Body position was determined using video tracking.</s><s>A foraging "trial" was considered as a visit to one port, defined as the period between entry and exit into a region of interest (ROI) around each port (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Correct trials were ones in which the mouse alternated between ports, whereas error trials were those in which the mouse left and then re-entered the same ROI.</s><s>In correct trials, each nose-poke into the port was either rewarded or not according to a defined probability schedule (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Reward probabilities were reset to their highest value at the start of each trial and declined exponentially with each poke.</s><s>Error trials were unrewarded.</s></p><p><s>To incentivize goal-directed behavior, we introduced three trial types with different initial probability of reward (high-, medium-, and low-quality patches), so that mice would benefit by taking into account the actual rewards received in a given trial, as opposed to adopting a fixed, reward-independent strategy.</s><s>Reward probability decayed exponentially at the same rate regardless of initial probability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>; Eq. 1 in Methods).</s><s>The three trial types were presented in a randomly interleaved manner and were not cued.</s><s>As expected, the average number of rewards gained was highest in high-quality patches and lowest in lowquality patches (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>However, the number of rewards mice obtained was lower than the total available.</s><s>This could be expected due to a trade-off between continuing to try to exploit the current port and leaving to try the other, at the cost of travel between ports (3.32 ± 1.70 s (mean ± SD)).</s><s>This tradeoff is formalized within optimal foraging theory by the marginal value theorem (MVT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , which states that optimal foragers should leave a depleting resource whenever the instantaneous reward rate within a patch drops below the long-term average reward rate calculated taking into account travel times (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>We tested the MVT in our data set and found that the reward rate at the time of leaving was indeed nearly identical to the average reward rate (0.19 ± 0.010 rewards s -1 on average and 0.20 ± 0.017 rewards s -1 at leaving (mean ± SEM); p = 0.54, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 16 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>Two additional predictions of the MVT are that 26 : (1) the mice should make more pokes in better than average trials, and less in worse than average trials; and (2) reward probability at the time of leaving should be the same regardless of the initial probability at the start of the trial.</s><s>We tested these predictions in our data set by comparing the number of pokes made (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>) and the expected reward probabilities at the time of leaving (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>) for the three trial types.</s><s>We found that, indeed, the number of pokes increased with increasing initial probability (F (2,45) = 3.49, p = 0.04, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), n = 16 mice) and that reward probabilities at the time of leaving were not significantly different across trial types (F (2,45) = 0.049, p = 0.95, one-way ANOVA, n = 16 mice).</s><s>In contrast, in a shuffled data set in which trials were randomly assigned to one of the three trial types, poke numbers were, as expected, similar across trial types (F (2,45) = 0.046, p = 0.95, one-way ANOVA, n = 16) and reward probabilities at the time of leaving varied with trial quality (F (2,45) = 4.13, p = 0.022, one-way ANOVA, n = 16 mice; see Methods for details of the shuffling procedure).</s><s>The comparison between shuffled and real data supports the idea that the mice were sensitive to the statistics of individual port visits and suggests that the mice employed a near-optimal strategy in this task.</s></p><p><s>Activation of DRN neurons prolongs active exploitation.</s><s>We next examined the effect of activation of DRN 5-HT neurons in the probabilistic foraging task.</s><s>Of the 16 mice examined, 10 expressed Cre-recombinase under the control of the SERT promoter (SERT-Cre) and 6 were wild-type littermates.</s><s>Both groups of mice were infected in the DRN with a viral vector containing Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV2/9-Dio-ChR2-eYFP) and implanted with an optical fiber cannula above the site of infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>After 9 days of training, we started a 10-day testing period, in which we photostimulated randomly on 50% of the correct trials.</s><s>Stimulation was triggered by the first nose-poke in each trial and lasted until the end of the trial (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>We found that the number of nosepokes in photostimulated trials was significantly greater than in control trials in ChR2-expressing mice (14.73 ± 0.55 vs. 13.61 ± 0.53 pokes per trial (mean ± SEM); p = 0.014, Wilcoxon signedrank test, n = 10 mice; see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for individual mouse data).</s><s>This difference was also significant comparing ChR2-expressing and wild-type mice (1.12 ± 0.36 vs. -0.46</s><s>± 0.18 (mean ± SEM); p = 0.0047, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, n = 10 SERT-Cre and 6 wild-type mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c-e</ref>).</s><s>The effect of photostimulation was short-lived, occurring only on photostimulated trials without affecting behavior on subsequent trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Activation of DRN neurons biases leaving but not travel time.</s><s>These results contradict the hypothesis that 5-HT promotes behavioral inhibition, as the willingness of mice to perform active nose-poking was enhanced rather than reduced by optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons.</s><s>We hypothesized that this phenomenon could reflect a bias in the process underlying the decision of whether to stay and poke again or leave after each nose-poke.</s><s>Consistent with this idea, we also found that photostimulation, which continued until the mouse exited the ROI, increased the delay to leave the foraging site, i.e., the interval ).</s><s>In contrast, the time it took mice to travel from one port to the other side was not affected (control vs. stimulated trials: 2.64 ± 0.23 vs. 2.77 ± 0.31 s (mean ± SEM); p = 0.56, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 10 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>However, the fact that photostimulation was not delivered during the travel period might explain the lack of effect on this measure.</s><s>Therefore, we subsequently tested 6 of the 10 ChR2-expressing mice from our original cohort using a protocol in which a 2-s stimulation was triggered by ROI exit, so that stimulation took place during the travel period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>In this case as well, no effect of photostimulation on travel time was observed (control vs. stimulated trials: 3.02 ± 0.31 vs. 3.19 ± 0.33 s (mean ± SEM); p = 0.22, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 6 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The proportional hazards model of probabilistic foraging.</s><s>Our analysis thus far suggests that DRN 5-HT neuron stimulation biases the decision process that sets the tradeoff between continued nose-poking ('exploitation') and leaving the site ('exploration').</s><s>We next sought to quantify this process more directly.</s><s>Despite the agreement between our data and the predictions of the MVT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), we deemed it unlikely that the mice were using it directly for two main reasons: (1) the MVT requires an exact calculation of the expected reward probability after each nose-poke, which would require knowledge of the underlying task statistics, memory of the preceding sequence of rewards and omissions, and representation the three reward probabilities corresponding to the three trial types (Eq. 2 in Methods); (2) the MVT is deterministic in nature and cannot account for the substantial variability we observed in mouse leaving times (this can be seen in the wide range of reward probabilities at the time of leaving in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>; the MVT predicts these curves to be step functions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, several simpler heuristics have been proposed to explain decision-making in probabilistic foraging tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Notably, a model known as the "proportional hazards" model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> not only aims at predicting mean leaving time but also models a stochastic decision process that leads to leaving <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> .</s><s>This model assumes that leaving decisions are taken randomly after each omission, based on an underlying hazard function (the conditional probability of leaving after n + 1 omissions, having experienced n consecutive omissions) and that the hazard function resets after each reward, albeit to a different value, due to the influence of various predictor variables (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref> and Eq. 3, see Methods for further details of this model).</s><s>We compared this model to a stochastic model based on the MVT's predictions (using the expected reward probability as the main predictor of leaving decisions) and found that the proportional hazards provided a better fit to the data in 15 out of the 16 mice tested.</s><s>The main difference between the two models lies in the resetting property of the proportional hazards model.</s><s>This feature results in a high win-stay probability, i.e., a high probability of staying after a reward, even for late rewards ("lucky" attempts that do not reflect the actual low reward probability), which was also evident in the data but not in the MVT model (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To test how well the proportional hazards model captures individual mouse behavior, we used half the data to fit model  parameters and cross-validated it using the second half.</s><s>These simulations were in excellent agreement with our data (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the model was accurate enough to predict idiosyncratic individual differences in poke numbers across mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>), as well as the effect of photostimulation on a mouse-by-mouse basis (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>).</s><s>When we examined the effect of photostimulation on the estimated hazard rate, expressed as the Cox regression coefficient for that variable, we found it to be significantly negative (that is, divisive or patience promoting) in SERT-Cre mice (p = 0.014, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 10 mice) and significantly lower than that of wild-type mice (p = 0.0075, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, n = 10 SERT-Cre and 6 wildtype mice; Fig. <ref type="figure">5e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, since the proportional hazards model assumes that stimulation's effect is constant throughout trials (rather than changing as a function of duration), we tested whether this was indeed the case.</s><s>To address this question, we first recorded multi-unit DRN responses in ChR2-expressing mice to 15 s long trains of optogenetic stimulation.</s><s>We found that 5-HT neurons kept responding to this stimulation, which was comparable in both frequency and duration to the one used in our behavioral experiments (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Since, according to the proportional hazards model, rewards reset the decision process, we reasoned that if the effectiveness of stimulation was changing with time, it should be different for trials in which last reward occurred early vs. late in the trial.</s><s>However, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows that there was no correlation between the time of the last reward and the effect of photostimulation on the number of subsequent pokes before leaving, suggesting that the effect of stimulation on behavior was constant throughout its duration.</s></p><p><s>Vigor of nose-poking reports the hazard rate of leaving.</s><s>The estimated hazard function in the proportional hazards model can be interpreted as a latent decision variable-the instantaneous propensity to switch foraging sites.</s><s>This variable plays a similar role to that of accumulated evidence in integration-to-bound decision models <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>In this interpretation, the effect of optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons is to slow down the dynamics of the decision variable.</s><s>To try to test this more directly, we examined the correlation between different behavioral variables related to nose-poking and the latent decision variable in the proportional hazards model (i.e., the estimated hazard of leaving; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>We found that the duration of nose-pokes for omitted rewards and the duration of inter-poke intervals mirrored the value of the decision variable (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Using these two variables, we calculated a measure that we refer to as the "omission duty cycle" (ODC: the ratio between each nose-poke's duration and the sum of the duration and the preceding inter-poke interval; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>).</s><s>The ODC, which essentially measures the rate or vigor of nose-poking, was indeed strongly negatively correlated with the model decision variable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>While both the decision variable of the proportional hazards model and the ODC change monotonically through a trial, this pattern is reversed when aligning on the last reward due to the resetting effect of rewards, such that the hazard is higher immediately before the last reward compared to immediately after it (0.056 ± 0.0041 before and 0.014 ± 0.0023 after the last reward (mean ± SEM); p = 0.00044, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 16 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>We found that, as predicted, this reversal was true for the ODC as well (0.86 ± 0.010 before and 0.87 ± 0.011 after the last reward (mean ± SEM); p = 0.0084, Wilcoxon signedrank test, n = 16 mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>These results provide evidence that the vigor with which mice nose-poke is: (1) monotonically decreasing in a manner reflecting the decreasing reward probability; and (2) non-trivially correlated with the effect of rewards on the modeled decision variable.</s><s>The latter observation argues against the possibility that simpler variables that would be expected to evolve monotonically during nose-poking, such as muscle fatigue, could account for the observed relationships.</s><s>Finally, we examined the effect of DRN 5-HT neuron photostimulation on ODC.</s><s>Since stimulation decreases the hazard of leaving (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and ODC is negatively correlated with the hazard rate, we predicted that the ODC would be higher in photostimulated vs. control trials.</s><s>Using linear regression analysis, we found that photostimulation indeed increased the ODC of SERT-Cre mice (p = 0.0098, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 10; see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> for individual mouse data) and that this increase was significantly higher in SERT-Cre compared to wild-type mice (p = 0.011, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, n = 10 SERT-Cre and 6 wild-type mice;

outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>However, because in this task "waiting" required active behavior (nose-poking) the results argue strongly against the hypothesis that 5-HT enhances waiting by enhancing behavioral inhibition.</s><s>Rather, 5-HT appears to stabilize an on-going behavior by reducing the probability of switching to the next one, i.e., stabilizing nose-poking while reducing the probability of leaving.</s><s>This behavior could be well described by a simple model, the proportional hazards model <ref type="bibr"

was to proportionately scale down the hazard rate, thereby reducing the probability to leave.</s><s>Thus 5-HT appears to act as multiplicative bias on the latent decision variable in the foraging decision process.</s><s>Foraging behavior is fundamental to any animal's survival.</s><s>Natural environments require animals to balance various consideration in order to achieve optimal results <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>Of particular interest is the exploration-exploitation dilemma: should the animal stay and exploit a depleting resource, or leave instead to forage elsewhere?</s><s>Within this framework, the MVT describes the optimal strategy, which is deciding to leave at the point in time when the instantaneous rate of rewards drops below its average value <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>However, the MVT, as originally formulated, applies to deterministic environments, where foragers have perfect knowledge of the instantaneous and average reward rates.</s><s>Although these assumptions are not realistic, and the solution for the stochastic case is quite intricate <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , a key prediction of optimality remains relevant: switching decisions should be made when instantaneous reward probability is equal to some fixed value, irrespective of whatever has happened up to this point <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Our study confirms that mice follow this prediction.</s></p><p><s>In order to model the dynamics of the stochastic environment, we used a simple heuristic decision rule, the proportional hazards model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>We found that this model captures not only the fixed relationship between instantaneous and average reward rate at leaving time but also the variability of this decision point across the mouse population (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>) and the case-by-case effects of photostimulation across mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>).</s><s>Here the effect of DRN 5-HT neuron activation by photostimulation was to decrease the hazard rate in a proportional manner.</s><s>It thereby increased the average time to reach decision threshold, increasing the time spent nose-poking before deciding to leave.</s></p><p><s>The proportional hazards model shares

behavior reflect latent decision variables, providing general insight into the "covert" processes underling "overt" decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr"

constrained approach will be a valuable way to approach the interpretation of 5-HT function.</s><s>At the same time, our results leave open the question of how more precisely to interpret the influence of 5-HT, since the decision variable that was modulated is highly abstract and represents the conjunction of many more specific factors that might enter into the decision to stay or leave.</s><s>Broadly speaking, these fall into two categories.</s><s>First, there are factors that represent the calculation of the costs and benefits of decision options.</s><s>These include the cost or effort of foraging at a given site ("handling cost" in the foraging literature), the expected reward gained for each foraging attempt, and the expected cost of travel to the next foraging site.</s><s>Second, there are factors related to the uncertainties inherent in the probabilistic foraging task, especially the uncertainty related to the stochastic nature of reward delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s></p><p><s>For an optimal Bayesian agent, estimating the costs and benefits of decision options must take into account the uncertainties of those estimates.</s><s>Thus the impact of DRN 5-HT neuron stimulation on the hazard rate of leaving might be due to a more direct effect on costs or benefits of staying vs. leaving or it might arise from a modulation of uncertainty which only indirectly impacts estimates of cost and benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>We currently favor the latter interpretation for two reasons.</s><s>First, the endogenous activity of 5-HT neurons reports unexpected events regardless of valence, as appropriate for a signal related to uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>Second, a growing set of evidence suggests that 5-HT does not exert the sort of motivational biases that arise from natural rewards or punishments <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>If 5-HT modulated the costs or benefits of on-going events with which it was correlated, one might expect this to be revealed in a broad range of situations.</s><s>Yet, 5-HT stimulation does not produce place preference or bias thigmotaxis in the open field <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> and 5-HT stimulation applied during the outcome of a two-alternative choice value-based decision-task does not bias choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>While these results are at odds with those reported by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> , which had found a reinforcing effect of optogenetic DRN 5-HT neuron stimulation on behavior, differences in the transgenic mouse lines used to drive ChR2 expression (ePet1-Cre in Liu et al. vs. SERT-Cre here) or the targeting of different anatomical parts of the DRN may account for this apparent discrepancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, elevated 5-HT levels have also been associated with aversive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>For example, acute tryptophan depletion (an experimental manipulation used to lower 5-HT levels in humans) attenuates punishment-induced inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> , suggesting that endogenous 5-HT release may reduce response vigor in the face of aversive predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s><s>However, these effects were shown to be specific to aversive contexts, which were absent in the current study.</s><s>Possible context-dependent differences in 5-HT's effect on foraging behavior could be tested in future experiments by, for example, introducing probabilistic punishments during resource exploitation, and testing the effect of DRN 5-HT stimulation on response vigor under these conditions.</s></p><p><s>One limitation of the present study is that the task was too complex to be modeled precisely by a simple model; the proportional hazards model is not the optimal solution to this task and the complexity of the optimal solution suggests that it is not likely used by mice.</s><s>This issue could be addressed in future studies using refined tasks in which simple optimal solutions exist.</s><s>This, together with additional manipulations of task variables, should help to ascertain more precise interpretation of the influence of 5-HT.</s></p><p><s>Here we have shown that optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons prolongs the willingness of mice to forage for stochastically delivered rewards.</s><s>Waiting can be considered a foraging situation in which rewards are expected but not forthcoming and the same class of integrate-to-threshold models can be used to model both foraging and waiting tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand, in waiting tasks, passivity and waiting are coincident, whereas in foraging tasks, waiting and passivity are decoupled: the choice is no longer between passivity and activity but between two different types of active behavior, nose-poking, or locomoting.</s><s>The reason that 5-HT stimulation favors patient waiting is apparently not because it favors behavioral inhibition or passivity but because it favors persistence in a current behavior, even if it is active.</s><s>One possible interpretation of this finding is that 5-HT it ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03438-y favors persistence by making behavioral transitions (switching from one behavior to another) less likely.</s><s>This interpretation can explain the observation that DRN photostimulation does not bias travel times between reward sites when stimulation occurs after the mouse is already in transit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> and ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref></s><s>).</s><s>It would also be consistent with an observed increase in active escape behavior in the forced swim test that is induced by stimulation of medial prefrontal cortex axons in the DRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> and enhanced lose-shift behavior in probabilistic reversal tasks, observed in patients with major depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> and in individuals homozygous for the long 5-HT transporter allele <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> , both associated with decreased levels of extrasynaptic 5-HT.</s><s>However, as discussed above, another interpretation is that decreased behavioral transitioning is the consequence of a change in one or more underlying decision variables.</s><s>For example, by increasing the perceived uncertainty of the instantaneous estimate of the reward rate, 5-HT could bias decisions in favor of continued nose-poking in the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Despite the tantalizing consistency of the above results, one should not lose site of the complexity of the 5-HT literature, which implicates this molecule in many functions with little obvious relationship to foraging, waiting, or persistence.</s><s>However, the application of relatively abstract computational models may provide a useful way toward a more satisfactory overarching understanding.</s><s>Rather than seeing 5-HT's effects in terms of a suite of diverse behaviors for which the overarching behavioral theme is missing, one may look to commonality of action at the algorithmic level.</s><s>If 5-HT has a common action on circuits that implement integration-to-bound, then the range of behaviors in which 5-HT acts, such as waiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , cognitive flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> , and sensorimotor gain control <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> , will be as diverse as the instances in which this algorithm is applied.</s><s>For example, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans it was found that 5-HT favors dwelling in a food patch over roaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> , and in larval zebra fish 5-HT is implicated in modulation of short-term locomotor memory to change visuo-motor gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> .</s><s>While the relationship between sensorimotor adaptation and probabilistic foraging is obscure at the behavioral level, neural integration is a common component of both.</s><s>The investigation of 5-HT action at the level of postsynaptic target circuits, together with computational modeling, will be important to test such hypotheses.</s></p></div>
