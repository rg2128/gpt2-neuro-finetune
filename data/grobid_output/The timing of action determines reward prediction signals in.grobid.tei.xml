<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phasic modulation of mDA activity at initiation of body movements and licking</head><p><s>Recent studies have found that activity in at least some populations of mDA neurons correlates to movement initiation in naive or untrained animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> .</s><s>In trained animals, DA release in ventral striatum can correlate with initiation of reward-related actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Thus, we first examined activity in naïve animals acclimated to the head-fixed context, but prior to receiving any rewards in that context.</s><s>In the absence of informative stimuli or expectation of water rewards, we observed significant inhibition in 10 of 12 mDA neurons from SNc and 9 of 17 in VTA upon initiation of body movement.</s><s>Only one mDA neuron in VTA and none in SNc exhibited significant excitation (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, modulation window vs baseline, see Methods; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>Reports of excitatory peri-movement responses in mDA neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> led us to more carefully examine activity around the time of movement initiation.</s><s>We measured the interspike interval (ISI) just before movement-related pauses in activity (see Methods).</s><s>This analysis revealed an apparent "covert" excitation in the form of a spike phase advance present in mDA neurons from both SNc and VTA (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a-b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, mDA neurons are modulated by a sequence of (covert) excitation followed by a more dominant inhibition prior to movement initiation in mice acclimated to headfixation.</s></p><p><s>Given evidence for more prominent positive modulation around purposive action initiation in rodents <ref type="bibr">2827,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> and primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , we next examined whether weak excitation in naïve mice might be altered by the presence of available water rewards.</s><s>Following the introduction of mice to auditory trace conditioning we again examined peri-movement mDA neuron activity.</s><s>We first considered movement bouts initiated during the long intertrial intervals that were well separated from either auditory cues or water delivery.</s><s>Such self-initiated movements occurred within the intertrial intervals in bouts (bout length: 3.9 ± 1.5 s) separated by periods of stillness (interbout interval: 6.4 ± 1.9 s).</s><s>Around half (57 ± 5%) of self-initiated movement bouts were accompanied by licking.</s><s>In contrast to the net inhibition of mDA neuron activity in the naive context, in a rewarded context we observed more significant excitation of individual mDA neurons just prior to self-initiated movement onset (23 out of 96 during training vs 1 out of 29 pre-reward training, p = 0.01, SNc: 19 of 66 during training vs 0 of 12 pre-training, p = 0.03; VTA: 4 of 30 during training vs 1 of 17 pretraining, p = 0.6, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Thus, SNc DA neurons were more likely to be excited at movement initiation than VTA DA neurons although significant excitation was observed from individual neurons in both populations.</s><s>As in naïve animals, net inhibition at movement initiation was still common in both mDA neuron subpopulations (SNc: 34 of 66, VTA: 17 of 30) and appeared to be unchanged in its magnitude (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>Also similar to naïve animals, covert excitation was present in non-"excited" neurons in the form of a spike phase advance just prior to movement-related pauses (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>Together these results suggest a majority of mDA neurons receive both excitation and inhibition upon movement initiation; however, excitation can be enhanced by the presence of rewards, while inhibition is not.</s></p><p><s>We next examined within-trial modulation of mDA neuron activity as naïve mice first began to consume water rewards in our training context (sessions 1-3; n=22 mDA neurons; n=6 mice).</s><s>Consistent with activity around self-initiated movements, we found that modulation of mDA activity after water delivery appeared to be associated with the initiation of consumptive licking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>This was particularly apparent in mDA neurons recorded in mice with variable latencies to initiate consumption (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>On average, mDA activity peaked prior to the first contact of the tongue to the water port (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b-c</ref>), indicating that activity was related to movement initiation rather than sensation of the water.</s><s>In trained animals, mDA neurons have a highly characteristic latency of response to auditory sensory cues -around 50ms onset, 85ms peak <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>However, early in training we observed little specific modulation of mDA activity until ~150 ms after water delivery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that the audible solenoid valve did not provoke a robust sensory or "salience" response in mDA neurons.</s><s>As training progressed a large additional component of the mDA reward response emerged that was time-locked to reward delivery (within the first 150 ms post-reward, p = 0.0002 trials 1-300 vs trials 301-900; 151-400 ms post-reward, p = 0.6, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>).</s><s>Also consistent with the lack of a strong sensory component to mDA activity at this early stage of learning, we observed no response to the louder auditory cue (audible tone: 70 dB; solenoid valve: 52dB; background noise: 55 dB; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) and none of our stimuli reached the intensities previously reported to produce salience responses (~90 dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>If it is the case that the modulation of mDA activity after reward delivery does not have a significant sensory component early in training, we reasoned that substantially reducing a salient sensory component of water delivery -activation of the solenoid valve -would not diminish the mDA response.</s><s>Thus, we recorded mDA neurons in a subset of animals using a silent solenoid that was undetectable across the ultrasonic frequency range (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>The phasic modulation of mDA neuron activity with an undetectable solenoid remained similarly well aligned to the initiation of consumptive licking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>).</s><s>Notably, in primary thirst and hunger centers in the rodent brain, even in naïve animals, modulation of activity can be predictive of consumption rather than a reflection of physical, sensorial contact with water <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Our data thus suggest that a movement initiation-associated phasic excitation-inhibition sequence is the earliest reward-related modulation of activity in SNc and VTA mDA neuron populations during novel learning.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emergence of sensory cue-related activity in mDA neurons during early learning</head><p><s>We next sought to characterize the emergence of sensory cue-related activity of mDA neurons over early learning.</s><s>Consistent with a large body of prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , mDA neurons lacked a coherent response to the auditory cue early in learning, but developed a robust, monotonically increasing phasic response with training (r = 0.32, p = 0.002, n = 96, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4ac</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, the proportion of mDA neurons with a robust phasic response at the time of water delivery also increased over the first three sessions (1-3 sessions: 10 of 22, 4-8 sessions: 38 of 43, 9+ sessions: 27 of 31.</s><s>p &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to responses to the auditory cue, response amplitude at the time of water delivery was not significantly correlated with the number of trials experienced (r = -0.06,</s><s>p=0.6, n = 96; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>The inference from existing data and influential models is that mDA neuron activity should directly "transfer" from a reward to an earlier, predictive stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> .</s><s>By contrast, our data -the first to examine the time course of the emerging mDA response to a predictive cue in naïve animals -suggest that mDA responses to the predictive cue and the reward do not exhibit the predicted, negative trial-by-trial correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Rather, auditory cue and water delivery responses had a small but significant positive correlation in individual mDA neurons across training (r = 0.26, p = 0.01, n = 96; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>).</s><s>We finally examined the relationship of cue and reward signals on a trial-by-trial basis selectively within neurons that had significant sensory cue-related responses.</s><s>Only 6 of 75 such neurons exhibited significant correlations between auditory cue and reward responses, and they were positive (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>).</s><s>mDA responses to predictive sensory cues and water delivery thus appear to emerge independently while being scaled by a common cell-specific factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We have described two apparently independent components of the phasic responses of mDA neurons: a movement-related excitatory-inhibitory sequence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) and a phasic excitation associated with sensory stimuli that emerges as mice begin to exhibit learned behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d, 4a-c</ref>).</s><s>In the sensory cue-related component, excitation is specifically enhanced as a function of the extent of learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>For the movement initiationrelated component, excitation was pronounced once water rewards were first available even for self-initiated movements in the absence of cues or water rewards.</s></p></div>
