<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Recent behavioral studies in both humans and rodents have found evidence that performance in decision-making tasks depends on two different learning processes; one encoding the relationship between actions and their consequences and a second involving the formation of stimulus-response associations.</s><s>These learning processes are thought to govern goal-directed and habitual actions, respectively, and have been found to depend on homologous corticostriatal networks in these species.</s><s>Thus, recent research using comparable behavioral tasks in both humans and rats has implicated homologous regions of cortex (medial prefrontal cortex/medial orbital cortex in humans and prelimbic cortex in rats) and of dorsal striatum (anterior caudate in humans and dorsomedial striatum in rats) in goal-directed action and in the control of habitual actions (posterior lateral putamen in humans and dorsolateral striatum in rats).</s><s>These learning processes have been argued to be antagonistic or competing because their control over performance appears to be all or none.</s><s>Nevertheless, evidence has started to accumulate suggesting that they may at times compete and at others cooperate in the selection and subsequent evaluation of actions necessary for normal choice performance.</s><s>It appears likely that cooperation or competition between these sources of action control depends not only on local interactions in dorsal striatum but also on the cortico-basal ganglia network within which the striatum is embedded and that mediates the integration of learning with basic motivational and emotional processes.</s><s>The neural basis of the integration of learning and motivation in choice and decision-making is still controversial and we review some recent hypotheses relating to this issue.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Although much has been discovered about the anatomy and pharmacology of the basal ganglia, there has been much less research systematically investigating their functions in adaptive behavior.</s><s>The considerable interest in neuropathology, particularly of the dorsal striatum and its midbrain dopaminergic afferents, associated with disorders, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (Saint-Cyr et al, 1995), Parkinson's <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Antonini et al, 2001</ref>) and Huntington's diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Joel, 2001</ref>), Tourette's syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Marsh et al, 2004)</ref>, and so on, has implicated this structural network in various aspects of action control.</s><s>However, historically, these functions have been argued to be limited to the bottom-up regulation of motor movement through output to the pallidum, thalamus, and to motor and premotor cortices <ref type="bibr">(Mink, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>More recently, however, interest has turned to potential role of the basal ganglia in the top-down or executive control of motor movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Miller, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>This interest has largely been fueled by new, more detailed, models of the neuroanatomy that have linked feedforward inputs through the corticostriatal circuit with these feedback functions through a network of partially closed cortico-basal ganglia loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alexander and Crutcher, 1990b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Nambu, 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition, this recent approach has led to integration of some previously poorly characterized aspects of basal ganglia function with motor control, particularly its role in decision-making based on affective or reward processes.</s></p><p><s>Considerable research has long suggested that the ventral striatum has a critical role in the motivational control of action, a suggestion captured in the characterization of this region as a limbic-motor interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Kelley, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mogenson et al, 1980)</ref>.</s><s>However, recent research has also implicated the dorsal striatum in the control of decisionmaking regulated by reward, particularly the role of the caudate or dorsomedial region of the striatum in the integration of reward-related processes with action control <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Balleine et al, 2007c)</ref>.</s><s>This research suggests that the striatum has a much broader role in the control of executive functions than previously suspected and, indeed, appears to be centrally involved in functions long argued to depend solely on the regions of prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Balleine et al, 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Lauwereyns et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Tanaka et al, 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Reconciling the motor with the non-motor, cognitive aspects of basal ganglia function in the production and control of adaptive behavior has become a matter of considerable speculation and debate, and a number of theories have been advanced based around the new and developing description of the neuroanatomy and neuropharmacology of basal ganglia and its composite subregions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Bar-Gad et al, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Hazy et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Joel et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">McHaffie et al, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>However, it must be conceded that, although promissory, much of this theorizing has been driven by these structural advances with relatively little consideration of evidence (or lack of evidence) regarding the functions of the circuitry involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Nambu, 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this review, we describe recent research from our laboratories that addresses this issue focusing particularly on collaborative projects through which we have started to assess homologous functions of corticostriatal circuitry in both executive and motor learning processes and in the motivational control of action in rodents and humans.</s><s>We begin by considering behavioral evidence for multiple sources of action control and recent evidence implicating regions of dorsal striatum in the cognitive and sensorimotor control of actions.</s><s>We then consider the evidence for two, apparently independent, sources of motivational control mediated by reward and by stimuli that predict reward and the role of distinct cortico-ventral striatal networks in these functions.</s><s>Finally, we consider the role of basal ganglia generally in the integration of the learning and motivational processes through which courses of action are acquired, selected, and implemented to determine adaptive decision-making and choice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MULTIPLE SOURCES OF ACTION CONTROL IN RODENTS AND HUMANS: GOALS AND HABITS</head><p><s>There is now considerable evidence to suggest that the performance of reward-related actions in both rats and humans reflects the interaction of two quite different learning processes, one controlling the acquisition of goal-directed actions, and the other the acquisition of habits.</s><s>This evidence suggests that, in the goal-directed case, action selection is governed by an association between the response 'representation' and the 'representation' of the outcome engendered by those actions, whereas in the case of habit learning, action selection is controlled through learned stimulus-response (S-R) associations without any associative link to the outcome of those actions.</s><s>As such, actions under goal-directed control are performed with regard to their consequences, whereas those under habitual control are more reflexive in nature, by virtue of their control by antecedent stimuli rather than their consequences.</s><s>It should be clear, therefore, that goal-directed and habitual actions differ in two primary ways: (1) they differ in their sensitivity to changes in the value of the consequences previously associated with the action; and (2) they differ in their sensitivity to changes in the causal relationship between the action and those consequences.</s><s>Generally, two kinds of experimental test have been used to establish these differences, referred to as outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Devaluation</head><p><s>It is now nearly 30 years since it was first demonstrated that rats are capable of encoding the consequences of their actions.</s><s>In an investigation of the learning processes controlling instrumental conditioning in rats, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adams and Dickinson (1981)</ref> were able to demonstrate that, after they were trained to press a lever for sucrose, devaluing the sucrose by pairing its consumption with illness (induced by an injection of lithium chloride) caused a subsequent reduction in performance when the rats were again allowed to lever press in an extinction test; ie, in the absence of any feedback from the delivery of the now devalued outcome.</s><s>In the absence of this feedback during the test, the reduction in performance suggested that the rats encoded the lever press-sucrose association during training and were able to integrate that learning with the experienced change in the value of the sucrose to alter their subsequent performance.</s></p><p><s>This demonstration was of central importance because, at the time, the available evidence suggested that lever-press acquisition was controlled solely by sensorimotor learning, involving a process of S-R association.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adams and Dickinson's (1981)</ref> finding was the first direct evidence to contradict this view and to suggest that animals are capable of a more elaborate form of encoding based on the response-outcome (R-O) association.</s><s>It is important to recognize that evidence of R-O encoding did not necessarily imply that animals could not or did not learn by S-R association and, indeed, subsequent evidence has suggested that both processes can be encouraged depending on the training conditions.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams (1981)</ref> found early on that the influence of devaluation on lever pressing was dependent on the amount of training; that, after a period of overtraining, the lever pressing by rats appeared to be no longer sensitive to devaluation.</s><s>This was consistent with the view that R-O learning dominated performance early after acquisition but gave way to an S-R process, as performance became more routine or habitual (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Dickinson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Dickinson et al, 1995)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, very similar effects have been found in human subjects.</s><s>In a recent study, for example, we <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Tricomi et al, 2009)</ref> trained human subjects to press different buttons to gain access to symbols corresponding to small quantities of two different snack foods (one of which they were given to eat at the end of the session).</s><s>When allowed to eat a particular snack food until satiated, thereby selectively devaluing that snack food, undertrained subjects subsequently reduced their performance of the action associated with the devalued snack food compared with that of an action associated with a non-devalued snack food in an extinction test.</s><s>In contrast, after overtraining, performance was no longer sensitive to snack food devaluation and subjects responded similarly on both the action associated with the devalued outcome and the action associated with the non-devalued outcome.</s></p><p><s>Devaluation effects have also been demonstrated when assessed using choice between different actions.</s><s>Rats trained on two different action-outcome associations have been found to alter their choice between actions in an extinction test after one or other outcome has been devalued either by taste aversion learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Colwill and Rescorla, 1985)</ref> or by specific satiety induced by a period of free consumption of one or other training outcome <ref type="bibr">(Balleine and Dickinson, 1998a, b)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Valentin et al (2007)</ref> reported a similar devaluation effect on choice performance in humans, using a training procedure in which subjects were allowed to make stochastic choices between two icons, one paired with a high probability chocolate milk or low probability orange juice and, in a second pair of icons, one paired with high probability tomato juice and the other the low probability orange juice.</s><s>When subsequently sated on the chocolate milk or tomato juice, their choice of the specific icon associated with the now devalued outcome was reduced, whereas choice of the icon paired with the other non-devalued outcome was not.</s></p><p><s>Thus, whether assessed using an undertrained free operant action or by means of choice between two actions, both rodents and humans show sensitivity to outcome devaluation.</s><s>Furthermore, in both species overtraining produces insensitivity to outcome devaluation suggesting that performance has become habitual.</s><s>These findings suggest, therefore, that both rodents and humans are capable of goal-directed and habitual forms of behavioral control.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contingency Degradation</head><p><s>In addition to differences in associative structure, demonstrated by differential sensitivity to devaluation, the R-O and S-R learning processes appear also to be driven by different learning rules.</s><s>Traditionally S-R learning was argued to reflect the operation of a contiguity learning rule, subsequently referred to as Hebbian-learning.</s><s>As one might expect, this proposed that S-R learning is governed by contiguous activation of sensory and motor processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Hebb, 1949)</ref>.</s><s>On a pure contiguity account <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Guthrie, 1935)</ref> that is all that is required whereas, according to the S-R/reinforcement view <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Hull, 1943)</ref>, the association of contiguously active sensory and motor processes is strengthened by a reinforcement-related signal that does not itself form part of the associative structure and acts merely as a catalyst to increase the associative strength between S and R. On this latter view, every time an action is reinforced its association with any prevailing, contiguously active, situational stimuli is increased.</s><s>This view predicts, naturally enough, that S-R learning should be constrained to the stimuli under which training is conducted and, indeed, in an interesting demonstration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Killcross and Coutureau (2003)</ref> found evidence of contextual control of S-R learning induced by overtraining one action in one context and undertraining a different action in a different context.</s><s>When tested in the overtrained context the action was insensitive to outcome devaluation; when tested in the undertrained context, it was not and showed the normal sensitivity to devaluation indicative of control by an R-O learning process.</s><s>By extension, the training of actions under distinct discriminative stimuli should also be anticipated to restrict S-R control to the performance assessed under that particular stimulus relative to other stimuli, consistent with aspects of previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Colwill and Rescorla, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">De Wit et al, 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, R-O learning is not determined by simple contiguity between action and outcome.</s><s>This has been demonstrated in a variety of studies, first by <ref type="bibr">Hammond (1980)</ref> and later in a number of better-controlled demonstrations <ref type="bibr">(Balleine and Dickinson, 1998a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Colwill and Rescorla, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Dickinson and Mulatero, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Williams, 1989</ref>).</s><s>Thus, for example, when action-outcome contiguity is maintained, non-contiguous delivery of the outcome of an action causes a selective reduction in the performance of that action relative to actions not paired with that outcome.</s><s>Generally, if a specific outcome is more probable given performance of a specific action, then the strength of the R-O association increases.</s><s>If the outcome has an equal or greater probability of delivery in the absence of the action, then the R-O association declines.</s><s>This increase and decrease in the strength of association suggests that, unlike S-R learning, R-O learning is sensitive to the contingency between R and O rather than R-O contiguity.</s><s>In contrast, S-R learning, being contiguity driven, should be insensitive to non-contiguous outcome delivery.</s><s>In one study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Dickinson et al (1998)</ref> found that, compared with relatively under trained rats, overtrained rats were insensitive to a shift in contingency induced by the imposition of an omission schedule; ie, when rats were asked to withhold the performance of an action to earn a sucrose outcome, undertrained rats were able to do so, whereas overtrained rats were not.</s><s>Thus, reversal of the contingency from positive (O depends on R) to negative (O depends on withholding R) affected undertrained actions, sensitive to outcome devaluation, but did not affect overtrained actions.</s></p><p><s>Although the influence of overtraining on contingency sensitivity has not been assessed in human subjects, there is considerable evidence that rat actions and human causal judgments exhibit a comparable sensitivity to the degradation of the action-outcome contingency produced by the delivery of unpaired outcomes.</s><s>Recall that an instrumental action can be rendered causally ineffective by delivering unpaired outcomes with the same probability as paired ones.</s><s>In fact, just as the rate of lever pressing by rats declines systematically as the difference in the probability of the paired and unpaired outcomes is reduced <ref type="bibr">(Hammond, 1980)</ref>, human performance declines similarly when the outcomes are given a nominal value <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Shanks and Dickinson, 1991)</ref> and, more importantly, so do judgments regarding the causal efficacy of actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Shanks and Dickinson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Wasserman et al, 1983)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p><s>These behavioral studies provide consistent evidence of two different associative processes through which actions can be acquired and controlled.</s><s>One of these, R-O learning, reflects the formation of associations between actions and their consequences or outcomes, a process that explains the sensitivity of newly acquired actions and of choice between distinct courses of action to changes in the value of their consequences and in the contingent relationship between performance of the action and delivery of its associated outcome.</s><s>Given the clear and substantial regulation by their consequences, the rapid and relatively flexible deployment of actions controlled by the R-O association is clearly consistent with the claim that this learning process is critical to the acquisition and performance of goal-directed action specifically and to executive control of decision-making and choice between courses of action more generally.</s><s>The second, S-R learning, process involves the formation of an association between the response and antecedent stimuli.</s><s>Performance controlled by the S-R association is, therefore, stimulus-and, often, contextually bound, and relatively automatic, appearing impulsive or habitual and unregulated by its consequences.</s></p><p><s>One might anticipate that these distinct learning and behavioral processes would have quite distinct neural determinants and recent research has confirmed this prediction.</s><s>In the following section, we review evidence suggesting that homologous regions of the cortical-dorsal striatal network are involved in these learning processes in rats and humans, findings that have been established using many of the same behavioral tests described above.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural Substrates of Goal-Directed Learning</head><p><s>In rats, two components of the corticostriatal circuit in particular have been implicated in goal-directed learning: the prelimbic region of prefrontal cortexFsee Figure <ref type="figure">1aF</ref>and the area of dorsal striatum to which this region of cortex projects: the dorsomedial striatumFFigure 1d <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Groenewegen et al, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">McGeorge and Faull, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Nauta, 1989)</ref>.</s><s>The networks described in this section are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>.</s><s>Lesions of either of these regions prevents the acquisition of goal-directed learning, rendering performance habitual even during the early stages of training, as assessed using either an outcome devaluation paradigm or contingency degradation <ref type="bibr">(Balleine and Dickinson, 1998a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Corbit and Balleine, 2003b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Yin et al, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, prelimbic cortex, although necessary for initial acquisition, does not appear to be necessary for the expression of goal-directed behavior; lesions of this area do not impair goal-directed behavior if they are induced after initial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Ostlund and Balleine, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, dorsomedial striatum does appear to be critical for both the learning and expression of goal-directed behavior;

the outcome; hence, this model accounts for one property of goal-directed learning, namely the sensitivity of goal-directed actions to changes in outcome value.</s><s>Furthermore, the extent to which the goaldirected 'forward-model' and the habitual RL system controls behavior is argued to depend on an on-going uncertainty-based competition between the two systems so that the system yielding the least uncertain estimates of reward controls behavior at a given point in time, a feature that can be shown to reproduce the differential control of behavior by the goal-directed system early compared with late in training.</s></p><p><s>Some fMRI evidence in support of the existence of 'forward' model-based value signals in vmPFC has emerged <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Hampton et al, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>However, although this is a very promising conceptual framework, a number of outstanding issues still need to be resolved.</s><s>First, although there are several ways of understanding the uncertainty that shifts between goal-directed and habitual control, these appear, nevertheless, to be axiomatically competing processes.</s><s>Hence, the notion they might at times operate cooperatively is not yet accommodated in this analysis.</s><s>Second, although it provides an elegant account of the differential sensitivity of under-and overtrained actions to outcome devaluation, it does not, as of yet, account for their differential sensitivity to contingency degradation.</s><s>Third, a strong implication of this model is that the computational function of dopamine relates specifically to the operation of the habit-like RL system, and not the goal-directed system.</s><s>Yet, dopaminergic neurons project heavily to the prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatal regions involved in goal-directed behavior as well as to dorsolateral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Gaspar et al, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Lidow et al,

system.</s><s>Finally, empirical evidence in support of the presence of distinct RL and forward model-based value signals has not yet been forthcoming.</s></p><p><s>An alternative model of reward-based action selection has been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Frank and Claus (2006)</ref>.</s><s>This model provides a literal description of proposed cortico-basal ganglia

error.</s><s>In essence this model is a literal implementation of a habit-like reinforcement learning process.</s><s>The prefrontal cortex is proposed to maintain outcome information during action selection in a working memory, which is used to exert biasing effects on basal ganglia circuitry.</s><s>The transfer of behavior from goaldirected to habitual control is proposed to take place through the strengthening of habit-like S-R associations in the basal ganglia which overcomes the biasing effects of the prefrontal system.</s><s>Although this is a promising approach for testing how such dual control processes could be implemented within the architecture of the corticostriatal network, extensions to the current model are required to accommodate all of the known behavioral and neuroanatomical properties of the two systems reviewed earlier, such as the differential sensitivity of these systems to contingency degradation and the differentiation of the striatum into medial (goal-directed) and lateral (habitual) components.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural Theories of Action Selection</head><p><s>Recent developments in the neuroanatomy and neuropharmacology of the basal ganglia have spawned a series of theoretical propositions regarding how learning and motivational processes might be integrated within this system.</s><s>For example, one attractive proposal is that the various ventral and dorsal striatal networks described above, and illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, are hierarchically organized, allowing information to propagate from one level to the next.</s><s>In particular, the recent description of spiraling connections between the striatum and the midbrain suggest an anatomical organization that can potentially implement interactions between networks (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>As observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Haber et al (2000)</ref>, striatal neurons send direct inhibitory projections to DA neurons from which they receive reciprocal DA projections, and also project to DA neurons which in turn project to a different striatal area.</s><s>These latter projections allow feed-forward propagation of information in only one direction, from the limbic networks to associative and sensorimotor networks.</s><s>On this view, for example, Pavlovian values could influence the effective Pavlovian teaching signal at one level, while enhancing dopaminergic activity, and hence instrumental performance at the next.</s><s>This could be revealed in a negative feedback signal from the GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons from the striatum to the DA neurons on the one hand, and the potentiation of the DA signal through disinhibitory projections on the neighboring cortico-basal ganglia network (eg, through GABAergic striatal projection neurons to nigral GABAergic interneurons to DA neurons) <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Haber, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Haber et al, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Yin et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>This model predicts the progressive involvement of different neural networks during different stages of learning, a suggestion that has received some support <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Belin and Everitt, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Everitt and Robbins, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jueptner et al, 1997b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Miyachi et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Miyachi et al, 1997)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Various kinds of evidence support this model; for example, although the feedforward projections from ventral striatum to the DA neurons projecting to ventral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Nauta et al, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Nauta, 1989)</ref> is relatively greater than the feedback projections to ventral striatum, the opposite is true of the dorsal striatum.</s><s>As such, the ventral striatal network should be expected to exert greater control over the functions of the dorsal striatum than vice versa.</s><s>There is in fact some evidence for this prediction; the Pavlovian facilitation of instrumental behavior is greater than the reverse; indeed, evidence suggests that the instrumental actions tend to inhibit, rather than excite, Pavlovian CRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ellison and Konorski, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Williams, 1965)</ref>.</s><s>As might be expected, therefore, evidence from Pavlovian instrumental transfer experiments is consistent with this model.</s><s>Thus, for example, dopamine activity appears to be critical for general transfer, which is abolished by DA antagonists and local inactivation of the VTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Dickinson et al, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Murschall and Hauber, 2006)</ref>, whereas amphetamine-induced sensitization can enhance it <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">(Wyvell and Berridge, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, evidence from specific transfer is more ambiguous; it is partially spared after inactivation of the VTA <ref type="bibr">(Corbit et al, 2007)</ref>, rendered nonselective by inactivation of dorsomedial striatum and abolished by inactivation of the dorsolateral striatum <ref type="bibr">(Corbit and Janak, 2007)</ref>, suggesting that stimulus control over action selection might be specific to the nigrostriatal projection.</s><s>Thus, based on these results, the dorsomedial area appears to influence only the specificity of transfer-specific transfer, whereas the DLS could be necessary for any increases in response vigor induced by Pavlovian values.</s></p><p><s>It is possible to speculate too on the way this model might be thought to account for the influence of outcome values on performance.</s><s>For example, evidence described above suggests that lesions of accumbens core reduce instrumental performance and also reduce sensitivity to outcome devaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Balleine and Killcross, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Corbit et al, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Given the role of basolateral amygdala in outcome values and its inputs to accumbens core, there exists at least the possibility that the influence of outcome values on performance is mediated by an amygdala-ventral striatal modulation of the excitatory dopaminergic afferents on dorsomedial striatum from the substantia nigra.</s><s>Never-theless, this general confluence of motivational processes through a common dopaminergic mechanism, although parsimonious, does not fit with the growing body of evidence demonstrating that the effects of outcome and Pavlovian values on performance are doubly dissociable (reviewed above).</s><s>There are, of course, other networks that have been implicated in the way outcome values influence performance.</s><s>First and foremost among these are the direct projections of basolateral amygdala to medial prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Kelley et al, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>But, of course, there are many other possible routes through which these structures might interact including projections to prefrontal cortex from the ventral striato-pallido-thalamic pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">(Zahm, 2000)</ref>, and, indeed, directly into dorsal striatum through the thalamo-striatal pathway generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Groenewegen et al, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Haber and McFarland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Zackheim and Abercrombie, 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Over and above this question of the integration of learning and motivational processes in performance, there is also the question of whether the corticostriatal networks that mediate R-O and S-R learning interact directly.</s><s>As described above, some evidence suggests that they form a cooperative network.</s><s>However, there is also evidence of inhibitory or competing interactions between these processes; thus, inactivation of dorsomedial striatum immediately places actions under habitual control <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Yin et al, 2005)</ref>, whereas inactivation of the dorsolateral striatum immediately renders actions goal-directed <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">(Yin et al, 2006)</ref> as if these two processes are always active and merely compete for control of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Balleine et al, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The generally accepted architecture of the basal ganglia emphasizes the operation of functionally distinct, closed parallel loops connecting prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and the pallidum/substantial nigra, and thalamus that feeds back onto the originating area of prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alexander and Crutcher, 1990a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alexander et al, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Nakahara et al, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>There is, on this view, integration within loops but not vertical integration across loops and, as a consequence, various theories have had to be developed to account for vertical integration;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p><s>Although there are numerous unanswered questions, we have shown here that there is likely to be a great deal of commonality in the way the cortico-basal ganglia network functions to control adaptive behavior in mammalian species.</s><s>Thus, we have described here two learning processes and two motivational processes that subserve goal-directed and habitual actions and that not only appear to exert similar behavioral control but also to depend on homologous neural networks in humans and rodents.</s><s>Of course, we are not proposing that these networks are identical or reducible on a point-to-point basis.</s><s>It does appear, however, that the functional anatomy and underlying organizational principles of the basal ganglia in humans and rodents are extremely similar and it will be an important task of future research to establish whether and in what ways they differ functionally.</s><s>There is, for example, striking similarity in the functional network controlling goal-directed actions.</s><s>As we describe above, objective and subjective measures of action-outcome learning correlate with activity in regions of medial prefrontal, medial orbital cortex, and the caudate nucleus in humans (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, we reviewed the now considerable evidence that prelimbic cortex and dorsomedial striatum in rats subserves a very similar function.</s><s>Generally, the homology between the rodent dorsomedial striatum and human caudate nucleus is relatively secure, although there are clearly functional differences in the rostro-caudal plane that remain to be explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Balleine et al, 2007b)</ref>.</s><s>There has, however, been considerably more controversy as to whether the rat possesses similar prefrontal cortical regions to humans and other primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Preuss, 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, this controversy has largely been concerned with narrower issues such as whether there is a rodent homology to primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (with <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Preuss (1995)</ref> claiming that there is not and <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Uylings et al, 2003</ref> arguing that there certainly is) or frontal pole <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">(Wise, 2008)</ref>, whereas there is growing evidence based on connectivity and density of connections, neurotransmitter types, embryological development, cytoarchitectonic characteristics, and (last but, obviously, not least from, our perspective) functional similarity that rodent prelimbicmedial orbital cortex region is analogous to human ventromedial prefrontal-medial orbital cortex (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Brown and Bowman, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Uylings et al, 2003 for discussion)</ref>.</s><s>Generally, however, there has been insufficient systematic research of prefrontal cortex functions in rodent and human subjects using similarly structured tasks.</s><s>More research along these lines would contribute meaningfully to an understanding of functional homologies in prefrontal cortex.</s></p><p><s>We also describe commonalities in the network mediating habit learning.</s><s>Although, given the literature, this is perhaps somewhat less surprising <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Graybiel, 2008)</ref>, it is important to recognize that much of the previous evidence has not only come from very different tasks but also the relevance of these tasks to S-R learning has often largely been inferred from the experimenters' description of the task rather than direct tests of the factors controlling performance.</s><s>There has, for example, been a large literature linking sensorimotor cortex and its efferents to dorsolateral striatum in rat in various maze learning tasks and other nominally S-R tasks involving discrimination learning.</s><s>As we describe above, this is, however, something that has now been confirmed more directly using behavioral measures that confirm habitual control of overtrained actions both in rats and, using a very similar task, in humans and found to depend on dorsolateral striatum in rat and on the analogous region of striatum, the putamen, in human.</s><s>At present, little is known about the structure of habit learning.</s><s>For example, although reinforcement learning models provide clear predictions on the nature of the reinforcement signal supporting habit learning, it is not currently known if this constitutes the dopamine error signal alone, some integral of that signal involving local neuromodulators of the dopaminergic input to the striatum, or some combination of these or other potential processes.</s><s>Likewise, although we have argued that amygdala has a central role in both reward and reinforcement processes, we do not know how these twin functions of outcome delivery are parsed neurally.</s></p><p><s>Although the goal-directed and habit learning processes that support the two major forms of adaptive behavioral control can be observed in both humans and rats and appear to depend on homologous corticostriatal circuits, it is unknown how these forms of learning interact and what conditions modulate whether they cooperate or inhibit/ interfere with one another.</s><s>As presented above, it is clear that under some circumstances they interact; goal-directed and habitual control of performance often appears to be all or none rather than some mixture of the two.</s><s>In other situations, these processes appear to be temporally related to one another and to function in synergy during the selection, evaluation, and implementation of actions.</s><s>This will be a critical problem to resolve if we are to formulate accurate models of real life decision making in the course of which ongoing routine actions have often to be suspended, interference between concurrent choices has to be overcome, and new information has to be incorporated into the decision process while, nevertheless, remaining adaptive, at least for the most part.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we also described considerable evidence suggesting that homologous structures in rat and human mediate the influence of motivational processes on the performance of goal-directed and habitual actions, particularly the influence of Pavlovian cues on choice.</s><s>Central and lateral OFC and ventral striatum appear to be particularly important for calculating and deploying the influence of Pavlovian values and, as described above, similar structures have also been implicated in rats in this process.</s><s>This is perhaps most clear in the influence of outcome-specific Pavlovian values on choice in Pavlovian-instrumental transfer; in rodent, this effect depends on a circuit involving accumbens shell, mediodorsal thalamus, and lateral obitofrontal cortex.</s><s>In humans, to date we have found evidence that the ventral putamen, a region coextensive with the shell, is activated in the presence of cues predicting the same outcome as the action when that action is performed, and is reduced when an action associated with a different outcome is performed.</s><s>Similarly, outcome values encoded as a consequence of exposure to, and consummatory contact with, the consequences of actions have been found to depend on amygdala, insular, and medial orbitofrontal cortex in humans and to rely on similar structures in rats.</s><s>Unfortunately, apart from very few notable exceptions, little of this research has been undertaken using comparable tasks or motivational manipulations organized to influence the same or comparable regulatory systems.</s><s>Again, it is clearly research along these lines that will make the most rapid progress in understanding functional homologies in motivation.</s><s>Finally, we do not have a clear understanding of the way that motivational and emotional processes regulate the networks that control choice and decision making in either humans or rodents.</s><s>The common features of the influence of outcome and Pavlovian values on choice in rodent and human subjects described above points to the fact that similar neural systems organized along similar lines likely underlie this integrative process at least in mammals but, for the moment, it would be pure speculation to attempt to specify those in any greater detail.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
