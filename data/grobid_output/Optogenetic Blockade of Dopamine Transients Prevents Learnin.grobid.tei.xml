decreases) are sufficient to drive learning, they generally do not address whether they are necessary, since they either do not attempt to block the normal physiological signal or they do so with a manipulation capable of acting independently to drive learning.</s><s>Further, these causal studies do not address whether dopamine transients only mediate learning in response to cached-value errors or whether these signals may also facilitate learning about rewards in settings where errors in predicting cached value are not responsible, as has been recently suggested for neutral cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here we addressed these questions using optogenetic and transgenic approaches to prevent transient changes in midbrain dopamine neuron activity across the critical error-signaling period of two unblocking tasks.</s><s>In one task, learning was unblocked by adding unexpected rewards.</s><s>Unexpected rewards are well documented to transiently increase dopamine neuron firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and are also known to unblock learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>Yet additional reward should induce both a cached-value error as well as errors in the prediction of value-less sensory features of the reward.</s><s>Importantly, the latter type of error is capable of driving learning even in the absence of changes in value <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>If dopamine transients are only necessary for signaling cached-value errors, then they might be sufficient to unblock learning, as has been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, but they should not be necessary.</s><s>Contrary to this prediction, we found that suppressing dopamine for a 5s period when the unexpected reward was delivered abolished learning.</s><s>This result suggests that dopamine transients are necessary for learning from both types of error signals.</s><s>This proposal was confirmed by results in a second task in which we unblocked learning by changing the identity of the reward without changing its value.</s><s>Suppressing dopamine transients at the time of the change in reward identity also abolished unblocking.</s></p><p><s>In evaluating these results, it is possible that suppressing the dopamine neurons affects motivation, is aversive, or acts as a negative prediction error to offset learning.</s><s>We believe there are several aspects of the data that make these explanations unlikely.</s><s>For instance, there was little or no effect of suppressing the dopamine neurons on responding during compound training, when the suppression occurred, particularly during the identity task in which reward value was not altered.</s><s>If food cup entry was punished or resulted in negative prediction errors, we would have expected to see extinction of conditioned responding in this phase of training, which we did not.</s><s>Critically this includes both the cue period as well as the post-cue food delivery period, when the dopamine neurons were suppressed.</s><s>In each period, we saw no effect on time in the food cup (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, compound training, bar graph inset) or on food pellet consumption.</s><s>This suggests suppressing the dopamine neurons did not diminish the motivation to eat nor was it perceived as particularly punishing or aversive.</s></p><p><s>We also think it is unlikely that suppressing the dopamine neurons blocked learning by acting independently as a negative prediction error.</s><s>In fact, negative prediction errors induced by reducing the number of rewards in unblocking task such as that used here typically cause increased rather than diminished responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, due to changes in the processing of the prior rewards.</s><s>This is the opposite of the effect caused by the longer suppression used here, suggesting it did not function like an endogenous negative prediction error would normally function in this context.</s><s>Further, in pilot testing, we found that a longer period of suppression, similar to that used here, was relatively ineffective at inducing extinction learning compared to several brief periods of suppression (see supplemental material, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The current result is consistent with recent fMRI and single unit data showing that errors in the prediction of information other than value, including sensory or identity, coexist in the midbrain generally and in dopamine neurons in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>While this might suggest yet another function for transient changes in dopamine neuron firing -that of signaling outcome identity or sensory errors, alongside errors in value, salience, information, and so on -an alternative proposal would be that dopamine transients signal changes in expected events more generally.</s><s>While value would be a very important dimension (or combination of dimensions) in which to track unexpected events for hungry, well-trained subjects in most experimental paradigms, a similar signal might also be elicited by changes orthogonal to value in other settings, when that information is deemed relevant by the subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with this idea, dopamine transients are sometimes elicited by the appearance of unexpected neutral cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>While such firing changes have been explained as salience or a value bonus tied to novelty <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, they might be viewed as an error evoked by the change in sensory input.</s><s>Accordingly, we have recently found that dopamine transients are sufficient and likely necessary for learning to associate neutral cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Their role in this function was not tied in any obvious way to salience or changes in the cues' associability.</s><s>Dopamine transients evoked by an unexpected reward may perform a similar function, at least in some downstream areas, causing associations to form between antecedent events and the unexpected sensory features that comprise a given reward.</s><s>This would explain why learned behaviors unblocked by the addition of reward are sensitive to subsequent reward devaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, such empirical evidence such as that presented here may reveal only a small part of the role the dopamine system plays in learning, given recent proposals that dopamine transients reflect discrepancies in a variety of increasingly abstract constructs such as information and internal beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the results presented here show that dopamine transients, in addition to being sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, are also necessary for error-based reward learning.</s><s>Given the contribution of both cached value and other types of error signals in the unblocking tasks used here, the requirement for dopamine transients suggests they play a general role in signaling erroneous predictions about the events around us, rather than being restricted to only signaling errors in predicting cached value.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number and Identity</head><p><s>Unblocking-Unblocking based on changes in number or identity was run similarly to prior experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>The main change from procedures followed in that study was to train on each rat on each type of unblocking separately to avoid interference between tracking of identity and number, which weakened the effect relative to prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Thus while each rat was trained on each type of unblocking, this was done separately and with different cues.</s><s>Approximately half the rats (n = 7) received number unblocking first and the remaining rats received identity unblocking first.</s><s>There were no main effects nor were there any interactions involving order (F's &lt; 1.564, p's &gt; 0.240).</s></p><p><s>Number unblocking consisted of three phases: conditioning,

presented followed by reward as in conditioning (6 trials/ block for each visual cue, with total of 16 trials/2 blocks for each cue in a session) and the remaining half of the trials were converted into compound trials in which these visual cues were presented together with the new auditory cues.</s><s>These compound cues were paired with two pellets delivered precisely as on V B trials.</s><s>In addition, on V UB /A UB trials, green light (532nm with final output of ~16-18 mW, Shanghai Laser &amp; Optics Century Co., Ltd.) was delivered to the VTA for 5s beginning 0.5s prior
