<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animals</head><p><s>Subjects were adult male Long-Evans rats (Harlan Laboratories) weighing 370 -470 g and housed individually under a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, with all data collected during the light phase.</s><s>All procedures were performed in accordance with the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Arkansas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of experimental design</head><p><s>Animals were chronically implanted with a recording electrode in the GCL of the OB and with stimulating electrodes in the PC that could selectively activate either AF or lateral olfactory tract (LOT) axons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>After recovery from surgery, animals were assigned to one of two conditions: naive or potentiated.</s><s>Naive animals received no further treatment in the next phase of the experiment, whereas potentiated animals received high-frequency AF stimulation at daily intervals to induce substantial potentiation of the population EPSP evoked in the GCL by AF stimulation.</s><s>Animals in both conditions were then anesthetized with urethane and extracellular recordings were made from M/T cells and presumed granule cells.</s><s>Peristimulus time histograms were constructed to assess each cell's response to singlepulse AF and LOT stimulation both before and after a single bout of high-frequency AF stimulation that fully reinstated potentiation in the potentiated group.</s><s>Although the response of cells to AF stimulation was the primary focus of the study, the response to LOT stimulation was also monitored as a control for nonspecific changes in cell excitability.</s><s>In a separate set of animals, AF axons projecting to the OB from the PC were activated antidromically from the OB to determine whether their conduction times were compatible with the long latencies at which the effects of AF stimulation on M/T cell and presumed granule cell activity occurred.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrode implantation surgery</head><p><s>Chronic stimulating and recording electrodes were implanted stereotaxically using a flat-skull orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Paxinos and Watson, 1997)</ref> under sodium pentobarbital (42.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and chloral hydrate (100 mg/kg, i.p.) anesthesia, with atropine sulfate (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) administered to reduce respiratory congestion.</s><s>Electrodes were constructed of untwisted polyimide-coated type 316 stainless steel wire (California Fine Wire) joined with Epoxylite 6001-M varnish.</s><s>A monopolar, 100-m-diameter electrode for recording local field potentials was implanted in the core of the GCL in the OB (8.7 mm anterior to bregma, 1.2 mm lateral to the midline, and 1.6 mm below the dura).</s><s>Electrical stimulation was accomplished via a tripolar electrode consisting of two 85-m-diameter stimulation leads targeted for the AF and LOT, with the AF lead located 1 mm dorsal to the LOT lead, and a 125-m-diameter stimulation reference lead scraped bare for 2.5 mm with its tip located 3 mm dorsal to the LOT lead.</s><s>This electrode was lowered at a 14°lateral angle through a burr hole over the anterior PC (2.6 mm anterior to bregma and 1.6 mm lateral to the midline) using electrophysiological guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Stripling and Patneau, 1999)</ref> to place the deepest lead in the LOT, resulting in placement of the second lead in the AF in shallow layer III of the PC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Reference and ground leads for monopolar recording from the GCL electrode were provided by stainless steel screws over the contralateral anterior neocortex and ipsilateral posterior neocortex, respectively.</s><s>Animals were allowed a minimum of 7 d postoperative recovery before testing began.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selective activation of AF versus LOT axons</head><p><s>All stimulation of AF or LOT axons consisted of 0.1 ms cathodal squarewave constant-current pulses delivered through either the AF or LOT lead of the stimulation electrode.</s><s>Because these two fiber systems run adjacent to each other in the anterior PC, we monitored the selectivity of our stimulation via the local field potential evoked at the recording electrode in the GCL (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>LOT stimulation evokes a large positive wave in the GCL representing a population EPSP produced in granule cells by dendrodendritic synapses in the EPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Rall and Shepherd, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mori, 1987)</ref>, whereas AF stimulation evokes a late negative wave representing a population EPSP produced in granule cells by the synapses of centrifugal fibers in the GCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nakashima et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Laaris et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, the current intensity for all AF stimulation was limited to a value that was Յ85% of the threshold for activation of the LOT-evoked population EPSP, thereby ensuring selective activation of AF axons.</s><s>In contrast to AF stimulation, selective activation of the LOT is difficult to verify because even focal LOT stimulation evokes a late negative wave that can be difficult to distinguish from that evoked by AF stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>In the present study, we limited activation of extra-LOT fibers via the LOT electrode by setting the current intensity for LOT stimulation to evoke a population EPSP that was Յ85% of its maximum amplitude.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Induction of potentiation in awake animals</head><p><s>After recovery from electrode implantation surgery, each animal in the potentiated condition received repeated high-frequency AF stimulation to produce potentiation of the population EPSP evoked in the GCL by this fiber system.</s><s>High-frequency AF stimulation consisted of 30 10pulse 100 Hz trains delivered at 5 s intervals through the AF electrode using a current intensity that was 85% of the threshold for LOT activation with a ceiling of 200 A. This stimulation (referred to hereafter as a potentiation treatment) was repeated once daily until the level of potentiation reached a plateau (6.8 Ϯ 2.2 d; mean Ϯ SD).</s><s>Testing under urethane was conducted 1-2 d after the last waking potentiation treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unit recording under urethane anesthesia</head><p><s>The effect of AF and LOT stimulation on OB unit activity was examined in both naive and potentiated animals under urethane anesthesia (1.4 g/kg, i.p.).</s><s>The anesthetized animal was placed in a stereotaxic instrument, the cisterna magna drained, the lateral surface of the OB exposed, the dura and arachnoid layers removed, and the surface of the OB covered with warm 1.5% agar in physiological saline.</s><s>Throughout the recording procedure, core body temperature was monitored by a rectal probe and maintained at 37°C by a thermostatically controlled heating pad and respiratory rate was monitored via a thermocouple placed at the opening of the contralateral naris.</s><s>Unit activity was recorded using either metal microelectrodes or glass micropipettes pulled using a Sutter P-97 horizontal puller.</s><s>Microelectrodes were advanced horizontally into the lateral surface of the OB near its midpoint in both the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral dimensions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) using a Burleigh Inchworm piezoelectric micromanipulator that provided a precise readout of the position of each recorded cell along the microelectrode tract.</s><s>Extracellular action potentials were amplified using an Molecular Devices Axoprobe 1A amplifier and Cyberamp 380 signal conditioner at a band pass of 300 -10,000 Hz and were digitized for subsequent analysis.</s><s>AF-and LOT-evoked local field potentials from both the microelectrode and the chronic recording electrode in the GCL were amplified at a band pass of 0.1-6000 Hz and also digitized for later analysis.</s></p><p><s>Every microelectrode penetration extended from the lateral surface of the OB to the EPL on the medial side and therefore crossed the mitral cell layer (MCL) in both the lateral and medial halves of the OB.</s><s>The position of each MCL was identified as the point at which the local field potential evoked by LOT stimulation reversed polarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Phillips et al., 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Schneider and Scott, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Griff et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 1E)</ref>.</s><s>To document the accuracy of this method in the present study, Chicago Sky Blue was ejected by iontophoresis at the LOT-evoked reversal point in six micropipette penetrations; in every case, histology indicated that the resulting dye mark was located in the MCL.</s></p><p><s>Immediately after the end of data collection, the animal was given an overdose of anesthetic and perfused transcardially with PBS containing heparin (2 units/ml), followed by 10% phosphate-buffered formalin.</s><s>The site of each chronic stimulating and recording electrode was marked using the Prussian blue reaction and 50 m frozen sections were cut, stained with cresyl violet, and examined under a microscope to verify electrode placement.</s></p><p><s>M/T cells.</s><s>M/T cells were recorded using either tungsten microelectrodes or glass micropipettes broken to a tip diameter of 2-4 m and filled with 2 M NaCl.</s><s>Units were classified as M/T cells if they could be driven antidromically by LOT stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Highly phasic cells were excluded from analysis due to the difficulty of distinguishing stimulation-induced inhibition from spontaneous fluctuations in firing rate.</s><s>M/T cells with stable spontaneous firing rates were tested for the ability of AF and LOT stimulation to inhibit spontaneous firing and for the effect of a potentiation treatment on that ability.</s><s>For this purpose, AF current intensity was set to 85% of the threshold for LOT activation and LOT current intensity to a value that evoked a population EPSP that was 50% of its maximum amplitude.</s><s>Single-pulse AF and LOT stimulation was alternated at 2.5 s intervals for 4 min before and 12 min after a potentiation treatment.</s><s>Peristimulus time histograms with 5 ms bins were constructed of M/T cell firing rates for every 4 min of data, representing 48 AF and 48 LOT stimulation trials.</s><s>The duration of stimulation-evoked inhibition was calculated for each stimulation site and 4 min period as the length of time that the cell's firing rate was reduced to Ͻ50% of its prestimulation mean.</s></p><p><s>Presumed granule cells.</s><s>We classified cells as presumed granule cells if they were recorded within the internal plexiform layer or GCL (i.e., deeper than the reversal point of the LOT-evoked potential) and driven synaptically by either AF or LOT stimulation.</s><s>In addition to granule cells, these layers also contain several types of short-axon cells, including Blanes, Golgi, and Cajal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Price and Powell, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Schneider and Macrides, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lo ´pez-Mascaraque et al., 1986)</ref>, at least some of which can be excited by M/T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Eyre et al., 2008)</ref> and/or AF axons <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boyd et al., 2012)</ref>, raising the possibility that we recorded from some short-axon cells as well as granule cells.</s><s>However, short-axon cells have an estimated population of ϳ13,500 in the internal plexiform layer and GCL of the rat <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eyre et al., 2009)</ref>, contrasting sharply with granule cells, which have an estimated population of 3,100,000 in the rat <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Struble and Walters, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>This yields a ratio of granule cells to short-axon cells of ϳ230:1, implying that the overwhelming majority of cells recorded from these layers using a blind recording technique should be granule cells rather than shortaxon cells.</s><s>This conclusion is supported by evidence from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cazakoff et al. (2014)</ref>, who labeled GCL cells using blind juxtacellular recording in vivo and found that Ͼ97% of labeled cells were granule cells.</s><s>Based on this evidence, the probability of recording from granule cells rather than short-axon cells in the present experiment should be quite high, allowing our sample of cells from the internal plexiform layer and GCL to provide an accurate characterization of the response of granule cells to AF and LOT stimulation.</s></p><p><s>We recorded presumed granule cells using glass micropipettes broken to a tip diameter of 2-4 m and filled with 2 M NaCl.</s><s>Synaptically driven cells were identified by advancing the microelectrode from one MCL to the other in small steps (2 or 4 m) while alternately stimulating the AF and LOT at substantial current intensities: the AF current was set to 85% of the threshold for LOT activation and the LOT current to a value that evoked a population EPSP that was 85% of maximum amplitude.</s><s>Once a cell was found that was driven by stimulation of one site, the current intensity for that site was gradually reduced to determine the threshold current for driving that cell.</s><s>The median latency at which the cell was driven was then determined using a current intensity 15% above that threshold; for cells that fired more than once after each stimulation, the latency recorded was that of the first action potential evoked on each trial.</s><s>The majority of cells were driven exclusively by one of the two stimulation sites.</s><s>Cells that responded at least occasionally to stimulation of either site were classified as preferentially driven by 1 site if the ratio of APs evoked by the 2 sites was 5:1 or greater.</s></p><p><s>Each recorded cell was characterized by its depth below the MCL, calculated as its proportional distance between the MCL (the point at which the LOT-evoked potential reversed polarity) and the core of the OB (the midpoint between the MCLs in the lateral and medial halves of the OB).</s><s>Once identified and classified, each cell was tested for the effect of a potentiation treatment on AF-or LOT-evoked firing using a peristimulus time histogram protocol similar to that used with M/T cells, with the current intensity for test stimulation at the preferred stimulation site set to 15% above the threshold for driving that cell.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antidromic activation of PC neurons projecting to the OB</head><p><s>PC neurons activated antidromically from the GCL of the OB were identified as follows.</s><s>A stainless steel microelectrode with a large (150 m) tip exposure was advanced into the core of the OB (identified as the point at which the LOT-evoked potential reached its maximum amplitude) and was used as a stimulation electrode for antidromic activation of centrifugal fibers.</s><s>A small window was opened in the lateral surface of the skull 3-4 mm dorsal to the PC and 1-4 mm posterior to the chronically implanted LOT/AF-stimulating electrode.</s><s>A stainless steel microelectrode with an 8 m tip exposure was advanced through this window into the PC in small steps (4 or 6 m) while stimulating the OB at a fixed intensity (600 -1000 A in different animals) to identify PC neurons driven by OB stimulation.</s><s>All electrode penetrations passed first through the agranular insular cortex and then entered the PC, passing through layer III and layer II in succession (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Neurons were classified as being antidromically driven from the OB if: (1) they had a sharp threshold for activation; (2) they exhibited negligible variation in latency at near-threshold stimulation intensities; and (3) if spontaneously active, they exhibited collision between spontaneous orthodromic action potentials and evoked antidromic action potentials or, if not spontaneously active, they followed paired-pulse stimulation at interpulse intervals of 3 ms or less.</s><s>Iron ions were deposited using brief anodal current (1 A for 5 s) at several identified points along each electrode tract during withdrawal and were subsequently stained using the Prussian blue reaction, allowing the position of each antidromically activated cell to be reconstructed from histological sections.</s></p></div>
