<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Using a novel procedure (CAM task) that allows the separate assessment of attentional and working memory capacities within the same test session, we have demonstrated that reducing cortical cholinergic transmission produces dissociable deficits in at- tention and memory.</s><s>Specifically, a high dose of intra-mPFC scopolamine produced a marked decrement in memory for the target stimuli across all delays, although there was no obvious attentional impairment in terms of accuracy.</s><s>When the cortical cholinergic projections were depleted selectively by intrabasalis infusions of 192 IgG-saporin, attentional and mnemonic performance was relatively unaffected.</s><s>However, increasing the attentional load by reducing the target duration to 0.25 sec impaired memory performance.</s><s>These data implicate cortical acetylcholine in working memory function, particularly when the attentional demands are high.</s></p><p><s>The pronounced memory deficit observed following intra-mPFC scopolamine infusions is consistent with earlier reports showing delay-independent deficits following scopolamine treatment in operant-delayed alternation paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dunnett et al. 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">(Dunnett et al. , 1991;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Everitt and Robbins 1997)</ref>.</s><s>It is tempting to suggest, therefore, that these animals failed to attend or encode the target stimulus, resulting in gross memory impairments even at the short delays; an interpretation consistent with nonspecific memory deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dunnett and Barth 1991)</ref>.</s><s>However, the present data fail to support this account, on the grounds that subjects in the present study had already attended to and responded to the targets that they were then required to remember.</s><s>These data are thus important in demonstrating a deficit in working memory that is not simply dependent on an attentional deficit per se.</s><s>Nevertheless, intra-mPFC scopolamine at the high dose did produce evidence of a performance deficit in the attention phase.</s><s>Although attentional accuracy was not impaired, the rats exhibited increased omissions and were slow both to respond and to collect food, suggesting possible deficits in arousal and motivation.</s><s>It seems unlikely that the effect of scopolamine on working memory can be attributed simply to impaired motivation, as the accuracy deficit in the memory phase was not paralleled by an accuracy deficit in the attentional phase.</s><s>There was less evidence of impairment in other aspects of executive control of responding, as neither premature nor perseverative responding was significantly increased.</s></p><p><s>A previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Robbins et al. 1998</ref>) also reported effects of intra-mPFC scopolamine on the 5CSRTT.</s><s>These authors found that a 10-µg dose of scopolamine significantly reduced attentional accuracy as well as impairing other aspects of performance.</s><s>However, these rats were trained at a target duration of 0.5sec rather than the 0.7sec of the present experiment, which had been used to ensure good behavioral performance at the attentional phase.</s><s>Overall, therefore, the data are consistent with both at-tentional and working memory deficits of the intra-mPFC infusions, depending on the precise task requirements.</s></p><p><s>The integrity of the cortical cholinergic system in memory function was further supported by the impairments observed in animals with selective saporin-induced nBM lesions, although, as in the case of intracortical scopolamine, their deficits were also not restricted to memory.</s><s>A working memory deficit in the saporin nBM-lesioned rats emerged under certain test conditions.</s><s>Specifically, when the target duration in the attentional phase was reduced to 0.25 sec, although both the sham and nBMlesioned trained rats performed well above chance level.</s><s>However, the nBM group was significantly impaired when a delay was introduced, especially at the longest delays (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The evidence of mild nonsignificant attentional deficits, for example, the increase in omissions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) is not uncommon in animals at this dose of saporin.</s><s>In a recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Risbrough et al. (2002)</ref>, nBM-saporin-induced lesions using a dose similar to the one used in the present study, also reported increased target omissions under demanding attentional constraints of reduced target duration and intensity, although response accuracy was not significantly affected.</s><s>In fact, we deliberately focused on this low dose of saporin so as to ensure that profound attentional impairments were minimized while measuring working memory performance.</s><s>There was also some evidence of impaired inhibitory response control, which emerged at the short stimulus duration with increased premature responding in the nBM trained rats.</s><s>Such deficits, as well as attentional impairments, are readily discernible at higher doses of saporin <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(McGaughy et al. 2002)</ref>, which damage neurons of the horizontal diagonal band of Broca (HDB) in addition to nBM neurons.</s><s>Notably, both cell groups are known to innervate the

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Procedure</head><p><s>Each trial consisted of two phases, the target (attention) phase and the choice (memory) phase.</s><s>The target phase was similar to the 5-choice serial reaction time task <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carli et al. 1983)</ref>, although the final requirement for the target duration was less stringent (0.7 sec for experiment 1 and 1.0 sec for experiment 2).</s><s>Rats were trained to discriminate a brief visual stimulus presented randomly in one of the five spatial locations.</s><s>At the beginning of trial, the house light was illuminated and the trial was initiated by the rat making an entry into the food magazine.</s><s>After a fixed 5-sec interval, the light at the rear of one of the apertures was illuminated for a short period (0.7 or 1.0 sec).</s><s>A nose-poke response in the aperture during illumination and for 5 sec afterward (the limited hold period) was recorded as a correct response.</s><s>Responses in a nonilluminated hole during the target presentation period (incorrect response) and failures to respond within the limited hold period (omission) terminated the trial.</s><s>The next trial began following a 10-sec intertrial interval, during which all lights were extinguished.</s></p><p><s>If the rat made a correct target response, a delay interval was initiated that was signified by the illumination of the food magazine.</s><s>The animal was required to nose poke the food magazine during the delay.</s><s>The last nose poke after the delay interval resulted in the choice (memory) phase when two lights were presented simultaneously for 3 sec.</s><s>One choice stimulus light was presented in the hole that was identical to the target light during the attention phase of the trial.</s><s>The second distractor choice stimulus light was a random light that occurred in one of the remaining four holes.</s><s>The rat was rewarded with two pellets if it made a nose-poke response in the choice hole that was the same as the original target light (correct choice response) while it was illuminated, and after, for 5 sec (the limited hold period).</s><s>A nosepoke response in the distractor choice hole or in any of the nonilluminated holes (incorrect choice response) or a failure to respond (choice omission) resulted in the termination of the trial and no food was delivered.</s><s>The next trial began after an intertrial interval of darkness for 10 sec, after which the houselight was illuminated.</s><s>Each session consisted of 100 trials.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the proximity of the choice stimulus lights during the memory phase could be presented at extreme locations.</s><s>For example, on some trials, the choice lights could be presented in holes 1 and 2, whereas on other trials, the locations could be holes 1 and 5.</s><s>Although we cannot dismiss the potential confound that discrimination might be easier when the stimulus lights were further apart from each other than when presented in adjacent holes, a comparison of the accuracy as a function of hole proximity (holes 1 and 2 vs. holes 1 and 5) revealed no significant differences on the last preoperative training day [accuracy: F(1, 12) = 0.122, P &gt;
