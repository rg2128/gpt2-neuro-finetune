of optogenetic stimulation of the cerebellar cortex and deep nucleus of mice in which ChR2 was differentially targeted to distinct sets of cerebellar cell types.</s><s>We found that blinks elicited by

target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Given that optogenetic stimulation of neurons upstream, but not downstream, of the site of locomotor modulation would be predicted to evoke eyelid closures that would be positively modulated by locomotion, these findings are consistent with the idea that there is a site of locomotor modulation within the cerebellar cortex, downstream of mossy fibers, and upstream of Purkinje cells.</s></p><p><s>The strength of the conclusions that can be reached from these optogenetic circuit dissection experiments depends on the degree of spatial and cell-type specificity that can be achieved.</s><s>Several lines of evidence support the specificity of these experiments.</s><s>First, the MF-ChR2 and Pkj-ChR2 lines have been previously used and validated, and we obtained histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral results consistent with their previously-described, specific patterns of functional ChR2 expression (i.e., a blink at laser onset with mossy fiber stimulation, at laser offset with Purkinje cell stimulation, and no blink in non-ChR2 expressing controls, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Second, the failure to elicit a blink with a fiber placed in the AIP of gc-ChR2 mice (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>) demonstrates that illumination was highly spatially specific, as predicted for the low stimulation intensities we used and the distance between the sites.</s><s>Thus, while we cannot exclude the possibility that there may have been additional functional ChR2 expression in other cell types in some of these experiments, the totality of the data support the conclusion that there is a site of locomotor modulation within the cerebellar cortex that is sufficient to enhance behavioral responses.</s></p><p><s>We cannot completely rule out the existence of possible additional locomotor modulation within AIP.</s><s>Some ChR2 expression in the cerebellar deep nuclei, including possibly nucleocortical reafferents29, could be present and mask modulation of MF inputs to AIP.</s><s>In addition, MF-ChR2 stimulation in the cortex or AIP could have antidromically activated MF collaterals.</s><s>However, the differential modulation observed at the two sites suggests that inadvertent antidromic stimulation was not a major factor in these experiments, perhaps because of the morphology and long range nature of mossy fiber axons44-46.</s></p><p><s>In summary, of all of the combinations of ChR2 expression patterns and fiber placements that we tested, only eyelid closures elicited by stimulation within the cerebellar cortex of MF-ChR2 mice were positively modulated with locomotion.</s><s>Thus, taken together, these findings suggest that locomotor activity acts within the cerebellar cortex, perhaps at the mossy fiber-granule cell connection, to enhance eyeblink conditioning.</s></p><p><s>An intriguing possibility is that convergence of locomotor and CS signals onto individual granule cells allows them to convey more reliable CS information to interneurons and Purkinje cells9,10,30,47-49.</s><s>Granule cells receive input from 3-5 distinct mossy fibers, as well as inhibition from Golgi cells.</s><s>Recent studies have demonstrated multimodal convergence of mossy fiber inputs onto single granule cells30-32,49.</s><s>Granule cells require multiple simultaneous MF inputs to reach threshold33, and MF-gc synaptic transmission is enhanced by glutamate spillover during locomotion10.</s><s>Convergence of locomotor and conditioned stimulus MF inputs to a granule cell would therefore be expected to increase the probability of a postsynaptic action potential in response to the CS during locomotion.</s><s>Modulation of Golgi cell-granule cell inhibition during locomotion50 could also play a role.</s></p><p><s>Our last experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) revealed that elevated mossy fiber tone is sufficient to enhance conditioned responses to a visual CS, even in the absence of changes in arousal.</s><s>These experiments suggest that locomotor activity modulates eyeblink conditioning through a mechanism that could allow not only locomotor signals, but any generalized increase in mossy fiber activity, to modulate cerebellar learning.</s></p></div>
