The second factor relates to the role of inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Börgers et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>One way to generate periodic inhibition is by the "PING" (Pyramidal Interneuronal Network Gamma) mechanism <ref type="bibr">(Börgers and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kopell 2003, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Whittington et al. 2000)</ref>, in which a gamma rhythm arises from the interaction between excitatory pyramidal cells (E-cells) and inhibitory interneurons (I-cells).</s><s>A synchronized gamma frequency train A of excitatory input pulses triggers synchronous spike volleys of the I-cells, which then synchronize the E-cells by inhibitory spike volleys.</s><s>The timing of the inhibition from the inhibitory neurons after the spike volleys of a coherent stimulus A to the excitatory neurons decreases the contribution of a competing, less coherent pulse train B that is uncorrelated with the more coherent stimulus A. As demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Börgers and Kopell (2008)</ref>, this inhibition amplifies the advantage of coherent input by raising the effective leakiness of the target neurons.</s><s>Therefore, the two factors of leakiness and timing of inhibition are partly related.</s></p><p><s>Leakiness and inhibition provide modulations in excitability, which are the key for the Communication-through-Coherence (CTC) hypothesis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fries (2005)</ref>, which states that oscillatory activity is a mechanism for efficient information transfer.</s><s>The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that enhanced modulation of synchronized excitatory neuronal activity in the gamma frequency range provides an advantage over a less synchronized input for various types of neurons using theoretical approaches and computer simulations.</s><s>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Börgers and Kopell (2008)</ref> have shown that more coherent excitatory stimuli may have a competitive advantage over less coherent ones for coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons, in agreement with experimental observations.</s><s>In their study, they investigated the responses of the PING model (consisting of an excitatory neuron and an inhibitory neuron, bi-directionally coupled to each other), to two input signals, each composed of a series of Gaussians at a gamma rhythm.</s><s>For a small standard deviation σ of the Gaussians, the input was sharply peaked, whereas the oscillation amplitude of the input rapidly decreases for broader pulses with increasing σ .</s><s>Sharper peaks and higher amplitude correspond to more synchronized input spikes, corresponding to a more coherent input.</s><s>The main finding of Börgers and Kopell was that the responses to the less coherent signal are suppressed by the more coherent signal as long as the inhibitory neuron provides sufficiently strong and longlasting inhibition after firing of the excitatory neuron.</s></p><p><s>The main focus of our study is to explore in detail, both analytically and by computer simulations, the responses of various types of single model neurons to multiple gammamodulated input signals.</s><s>There are two main differences between our work and the work by Börgers and Kopell.</s><s>The first difference relates to the fact that we focus mainly on the responses of single model neurons.</s><s>A few simulations were done for the PING model to compare the results for the single neurons to that for the PING model.</s><s>The second difference is related to the type of input.</s><s>In the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Börgers and Kopell (2008)</ref>, the width and amplitude of the gaussianshaped volleys covaried, whereas we only considered variations in amplitude of the gamma-modulated signal.</s><s>We use sinusoidal input signals with a frequency in the gamma range superimposed on a mean firing rate, rather than periodic Gaussian-shaped input.</s><s>Recordings of EEG and MEG (see, e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schoffelen et al. 2005</ref>) and local field potentials (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Womelsdorf et al. 2005)</ref> have shown that a realistic gamma  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>A rougher but still reasonable approximation is by a sinusoid, which motivates our choice.</s><s>Through a combination of theoretical results and simulations, we show that entrainment of the output of the LIF neuron can occur by the input with the larger gamma modulation and we specify the parameter range where it takes place.</s><s>The combined simplicity of our input signal and the LIF model allows for some rigorous results.</s></p><p><s>Our results demonstrate that stimulus selection can take place at the level of a single neuron, even without inhibition as in the PING model.</s><s>The input signal with the larger gamma modulation can entrain the output of a single neuron because the structure of the input prevents firing at specific time windows.</s><s>If the amplitude of one of the gamma signals is sufficiently large, the neuron may fire at a high probability when the sinusoid is positive, and by the time that the membrane potential returns to the firing threshold again, the sinusoid with the larger amplitude becomes negative and thereby reduces the probability of firing.</s><s>This result applies to a variety of models [quadratic integrate and fire neuron, Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron, PING model] showing that the pattern of the entrainment of the output of the neuron by the input with a larger gamma modulation is similar as in the case of the LIF neuron.</s></p></div>
