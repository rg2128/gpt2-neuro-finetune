<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LC-GABA neurons reduce LC-NA-mediated arousal</head><p><s>To test if LC-GABA neurons affect LC-mediated arousal, we first established the relationship between LC-NA activity and pupil size of awake head-restrained mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>We examined whether pupil size correlates with NA activity using two-photon imaging of axons filled with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s in the visual and prefrontal cortex of Dbh-Cre and TH-Cre mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>We found that NA activity correlated positively with pupil size and increased before pupil dilation events (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 c-f</ref>).</s><s>We also confirmed these data with photo-identification of singleunits recording in the LC of Dbh-Cre animals expressing Flox-ChR2 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2  g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>As an additional indicator of arousal, we examined body movement along with pupil size and found a tight correlation between the two measures (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>This finding is consistent with previous studies which have shown that pupil size reflects LC neuronal activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>It also confirms the relationship between LC NA activity, pupil size and global increase in arousal as previously measured with EEG and cortical LFP recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and locomotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>We thus consider pupil size as a useful measure of NAmediated arousal.</s></p><p><s>To demonstrate causality between NA activity and pupil size, we injected a Flox-ChR2-mCherry virus bilaterally in the LC of Dbh-Cre mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), implanted optic fibers connected to a solid-state laser light source in the LC of both hemispheres (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>), and applied pulsed blue light to mimic the observed increase in LC-NA activity preceding pupil dilation, as recorded in photo-tagged LC-NA units (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>As hypothesized from NA axonal imaging, we observed a robust increase in pupil size after light activation of ChR2-expressing NA neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>Pupil dilation was dependent on baseline pupil size, since activating LC-NA neurons in periods of already increased arousal produced smaller increases in pupil size, thus explaining the observed trial to trial variability (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Even moderate activation of LC-NA neurons (pulse duration of 0.1 s at a frequency of 5 Hz) was sufficient to dilate the pupil, and this dilation increased with higher intensities of light activation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>We did not observe pupil dilation in control experiments using similar patterns of light activation in Dbh-Cre mice expressing only a fluorescent marker (Flex-tdTomato) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Subsequently, we optically silenced LC-NA neurons to examine if their activity was necessary for pupil dilation.</s><s>After injection of Flex-ArchT-mCherry virus in Dbh-Cre mice and implantation of optic fibers, we silenced spontaneous LC-NA activity with green light, and observed pupil constriction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>While all Dbh-ArchT mice showed pupil constriction with light, this constriction was not observed in mice expressing the fluorophore alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2i</ref>).</s><s>These results demonstrate that LC-NA activity is sufficient to alter pupil dilation and that a change in NA activity is reliably reflected in pupil size.</s></p><p><s>Our anatomical and slice electrophysiological results suggested that local LC-GABA neurons are positioned to inhibit LC-NA neurons.</s><s>We tested this hypothesis by implanting an optic fiber over the LC in Gad2-Cre mice locally injected with Flox-ChR2 or VGAT-YFP-ChR2, where all inhibitory neurons express ChR2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Light activation produced a decrease in pupil size following focal stimulation, which was not observed in control animals (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>Overall, these results demonstrate that local GABA neurons in the LC control the activity of NA neurons, and arousal level as reflected in pupil size.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inputs to LC-GABA and LC-NA neurons</head><p><s>To further understand the function of LC-GABA neurons with respect to LC-NA neurons, we targeted a modified rabies virus (RV) separately to each subpopulation to examine the anatomical sources of their presynaptic inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>We injected two Cre dependent (AAV) "helper" viruses to express the avian-specific retroviral receptor (TVA) and the rabies glycoprotein in Gad2-Cre or Dbh-Cre mice.</s><s>Three weeks after the first injection, we injected the modified RV (rabies-deleted-glycoprotein-mCherry + EnvA) that only infected cells expressing TVA and spread only from cells expressing the glycoprotein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>We waited an additional week and examined coronal sections of the entire brain.</s><s>Both experiments showed neurons positive for mCherry in a wide range of locations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>; and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>We counted input neurons and assigned them to different brain regions.</s><s>To visualize the projection patterns to LC-GABA and LC-NA neurons, we created a map of the relative contribution of each brain region to the two subpopulations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">e:</ref> showing regions with &gt; 0.5% total inputs).</s><s>Brain regions contacting LC-NA neurons directly were similar to those reported previously, consisting of diverse structures related to sensory, cognitive, autonomic and motor functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>Nearly all of the approximately 50 regions providing input to LC-NA neurons also projected to LC-GABA neurons (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>However, there were variations in the extent of projections; mapping the differential contribution of input regions to the two LC neuron subtypes showed 7 core regions projecting preferentially to LC-GABA versus 2 regions to LC-NA neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</s><s>Thus, these findings demonstrate that the two neuronal subtypes in the LC receive largely similar inputs whereas a few regions provide preferential input to one neuronal subtype or another.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two types of arousal-related neuronal activity in the LC</head><p><s>To understand how LC-NA and LC-GABA neurons integrate their inputs to influence arousal levels in the brain, we recorded from Dbh and Gad2 expressing neurons identified with optogenetics (photo-tagging).</s><s>Dbh-Cre or Gad2-Cre mice were injected with a Flox-ChR2 virus, and light activated neurons were recorded with a 16-channel silicon probe equipped with an optic fiber connected to a laser source (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>The probe was coated with DiI crystals to verify the recording location, together with immunohistochemistry against TH to identify the LC, after each successful session (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>Using this multichannel probe and the use of automated spike sorting, we isolated single units from our extracellular recordings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>Brief laser pulses (&lt; 5 ms) were applied and units responding to laser pulses with a short delay (&lt; 10 ms) were identified as Dbh-ChR2 or Gad2-ChR2 expressing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Of 433 units recorded in 21 sessions from 13 mice, 19 Dbh-ChR2 and 18 Gad2-ChR2 units were photo-tagged using this method (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f-j</ref>).</s><s>The delay and jitter of light-elicited spikes were similar for the Dbh-and Gad2-ChR2 conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f-g</ref>).</s><s>The Gad2 units showed higher levels of spontaneous activity and had shorter spike durations than Dbh units (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4h-j</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next examined the relationship of Dbh-and Gad2-ChR2 photo-tagged units to pupil size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>As expected from the axonal calcium imaging data from LC-NA neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-f</ref>) and from responses of photo-tagged LC-NA units (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>), pupil dilation was associated with an increase in activity of photo-tagged Dbh-ChR2 units.</s><s>In contrast, the activity of Gad2-ChR2 units was more heterogeneous, with individual units showing negative or positive correlation with pupil size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>The Pearson correlation coefficient between firing rates of LC units and pupil size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>) showed that all Dbh units correlated positively with pupil size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>This matched the correlation recorded with two-photon calcium imaging of LC-NA axons in the cortex (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) On the other hand, Gad2 units correlated both positively (Gad2+) and negatively (Gad2-) with pupil size (61% and 33% of Gad2 units respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>The activity of Gad2-neurons globally increased during periods of low pupil constriction while Gad2+ and Dbh neurons increased their activity during pupil dilation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also examined the relationship of 396 units, which were recorded in the same mice but were not photo-tagged, to pupil dilation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>We classified these units as fast-spiking (FS) or regular-spiking (RS) based on their spike shape, and extracted two clusters by fitting a gaussian mixture model to the data (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>The FS and RS clusters overlapped the spikes recorded in Gad2 and Dbh mice (11/18 and 17/19 overlap between Gad2 and FS, and Dbh and RS neurons respectively).</s><s>Spike shapes of some Gad2 neurons were not well separated from Dbh neurons, demonstrating the difficulty of cell-type identification based on spike shape alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Still, as for photo-tagged Dbh and Gad2 units, RS units were positively correlated with pupil size whereas FS units were both positively (FS+) and negatively (FS-) correlated in similar proportion to Gad2+ and Gad2-neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b-e</ref>), indicating a robust classification of these neuron types based on their pupillary effects.</s></p><p><s>We examined more closely the effect of the different types of units on pupil dilation by calculating the cross correlation between spike rate and pupil size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e</ref>).</s><s>The peak in cross-correlation for Dbh and Gad2+ units overlapped, whereas the Gad2-units showed a broad trough in cross-correlation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>; see also Supplementary Fig5 f,g).</s><s>To get a better understanding of the timing of different LC units, we aligned their activity to dilation events (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>).</s><s>Dbh and Gad2+ units showed a significant increase in their activity preceding dilation, whereas Gad2-units showed no significant modulation in activity during dilation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>As a net effect, Gad2+ and Dbh activity correlated tightly during dilation and arousal, whereas Gad2-activity was broadly anticorrelated to the rest of LC activity.</s><s>These two types of Gad2 units did not differ in their spontaneous firing rate, their waveform duration or their light evoked response (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>Thus, Gad2+ and Gad2-units do not necessarily represent separate subpopulations of interneurons based on their firing properties, but rather subpopulations that differ in the inputs they receive.</s><s>Hence, brain regions targeting similarly LC-GABA and LC-NA neurons (e.g.</s><s>LH, CeA, DpMe, PnO or Gi) would be the inputs to Gad2+ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> d,e), whereas Gad2-neurons are wired more toward regions that differentially target LC-GABA neurons (e.g.</s><s>PFC, LHb, SPF, SN, deep layers of SC or some regions of the medulla) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Overall, the two types of activity recorded from photo-tagged Gad2-ChR2 neurons are consistent with the findings of tracing experiments demonstrating similar as well as preferential inputs to LC-NA and LC-GABA neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), and they lead to specific hypotheses about their role.</s><s>In one case, regions providing similar inputs may drive both LC-GABA and LC-NA neurons leading to correlated activity in these neurons, and inhibition could act as a feedforward gain control mechanism for arousal (similar to that seen in the cortex with thalamic inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> ).</s><s>In the other case, LC-GABA neurons that are broadly anti-correlated to arousal may be driven by a different input source than LC-NA neurons, allowing for independent positive and negative control of arousal.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coincident inputs to LC-GABA neurons provide gain control of LC-NA neurons</head><p><s>Our anatomical and electrophysiological results imply that a subset of LC-GABA neurons receives coincident inputs with LC-NA neurons.</s><s>This suggests that feedforward inhibition is present at the level of LC and that local GABA neurons provide gain control to LC-NA neurons.</s><s>We assessed this hypothesis by presenting auditory tone pips that varied randomly in frequency and amplitude.</s><s>Tone pips activate LC neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , potentially by direct inputs from the inferior colliculus, the reticular formation of the pons, and the gigantocellular nucleus of the medulla; all these regions provide similar magnitude of input to LC-NA and LC-GABA neurons, as revealed by our anatomical tracer experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d-f</ref>).</s><s>Recordings from GCaMP6s-expressing NA axons in the cortex confirmed that LC-NA neurons respond to tone pips (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Unit recordings of Dbh-and Gad2-ChR2 neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>) showed that both responded to tone pips (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>).</s><s>The delay of peak response from the onset of tone pip was 80 ± 14 ms and 51 ± 14 ms for the recorded population of Dbh and Gad2 units respectively (n = 14 and 7 tone responsive units, p = 0.2, two-tailed unpaired t-test, t 19 = 1.3272).</s><s>These data suggest that auditory stimuli activate principally coincident inputs to LC-GABA and LC-NA neurons.</s></p><p><s>Since tone pips evoked responses in both type of LC neurons, we used these stimuli to assess the possible modulation of LC-NA responses by LC-GABA neurons.</s><s>We presented a random and sparse sequence of auditory stimuli of different frequencies and intensities to a group of mice, while recording pupil diameter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>).</s><s>Simultaneous recording of pupil diameter and LC-NA activity showed that increase in pupil size followed the increase in LC-NA activity to auditory stimuli (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>).</s><s>Silencing NA neurons prevented this pupil dilation response (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8c-d</ref>), demonstrating that pupil size can be used to track NA activation with these stimuli.</s><s>The pupil dilation response to auditory stimuli increased with the intensity of auditory tone independent of tone frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6e</ref>, f and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9a-c</ref>).</s><s>Then, we used Gad2-Cre mice injected in the LC with flox-ChR2, with implanted optic fiber, to examine the role of LC-GABA activity on LC-NA responses involving coincident inputs.</s><s>The trial averaged traces with or without laser activation demonstrated that activating LC-GABA neurons produced a constricting effect on pupil size, while mild pupil dilation was still detectable after the tone presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6g</ref>).</s><s>Similar to activating LC-GABA neurons during spontaneous fluctuations of arousal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>,j), we observed a uniform sustained (spanning several secs) reduction of pupil size across all sound intensities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6g-j</ref>).</s><s>To examine the effect of activating LC-GABA neurons on the transient response of LC-NA neurons to sensory stimuli, we removed the tonic effect of LC-GABA activation.</s><s>We normalized the response for each tone to a 0.5 sec baseline period preceding the tone onset when the laser was already on, and averaged the pupil response for 1.5 sec after tone pips (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6k</ref>;
