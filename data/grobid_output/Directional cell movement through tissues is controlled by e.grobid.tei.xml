<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sc</head><p><s>Exosomes promote effective cell motility by carrying ECM.</s><s>A specialized endolysosomal compartment that could potentially control cell migration is the MVE, which on fusion with the plasma membrane releases exosome vesicles to the extracellular milieu <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>To confirm that exosome secretion is inhibited in HT1080 Rab27aKD and HT1080 Syt7KD cells, exosomes were purified from conditioned media by serial centrifugation and analysed by NanoSight particle analysis and immunoblotting for the exosome marker flotillin and the ECM molecule FN.</s><s>NanoSight analysis revealed that HT1080 Rab27aKD and HT1080 Syt7KD cells secreted 2.2-to 3-fold fewer exosomes/cell than control cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the reduction in exosome secretion, the immunodetection of flotillin and FN was similarly reduced in exosome preparations from HT1080 Rab27aKD and HT1080 Syt7KD cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>, top panel).</s><s>However, when an equal number of vesicles was loaded on blots, there was no difference in

defect in the speed of migration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, 'Exo 0' condition).</s><s>However, unlike the migration in vivo, HT1080 Rab27aKD did not exhibit diminished persistence compared with HT1080 Scrambled , as quantitated by the persistence index (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>, 'Exo 0', to in vivo migration results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>) and visualized in Wind-Rose plots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>).</s><s>We speculate that this difference reflects the presence

target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>As a first test of these possible roles, exosomes purified from control HT1080 cells were added to the cells in two formatseither added into the media at the time of migration like a growth factor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>) or coated overnight onto tissue culture plates similar to ECM coatings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>).</s><s>On addition of purified exosomes, HT1080 Scrambled cells exhibited increased migration speed, especially when exosomes were coated onto culture dishes.</s><s>Interestingly, the speed defect of HT1080 Rab27aKD cells was fully rescued on exosome-coated plates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>) but not with the addition of exosomes into media containing exosome-depleted serum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that deposition of exosomes to the substrata where it is accessible to the basal cell surface is important for their ability to promote cell migration.</s></p><p><s>The presence of FN on exosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>), the lamellipodial stability defect of KD cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and the selective rescue of Rab27a-KD cells on exosome-coated plates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>) suggest that exosomes may serve a critical function in providing matrix attachment for migrating cells.</s><s>By immunoprecipitation, FN is on the outside of exosomes, indicating that it is indeed of the expected topology to support adhesion and migration (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether the presence of FN on exosomes is important for their ability to support migration, we prepared FN-depleted exosomes by culturing control cells for 10 days in FN-depleted serum before collecting 48-h conditioned serum-free media for exosome purification.</s><s>This procedure led to a 2.5-fold decrease in the FN content of exosomes, compared with control preparations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4g</ref>).</s><s>When coated onto culture dishes and tested in single-cell motility experiments, FN-depleted exosomes were less efficient at rescuing single-cell motility than control exosomes (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4h</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, while 10 mg ml À 1 coating of control exosomes fully rescued motility of Rab27a-KD cells, twice as many FN-depleted exosomes were required to rescue their motility.</s><s>The rescue of Rab27a-KD cell motility by 20 mg ml À 1 FN-depleted exosomes could be due to remaining FN on the FN-depleted exosomes or to other exosome cargoes.</s></p><p><s>The concomitant decrease in FN and the membrane marker flotillin in exosome preparations from Rab27a-and Syt7-KD cells that were loaded according to equal cell number (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>, top blot) suggests that FN is not merely a contaminant of our ultracentrifugation (UC) preparation technique.</s><s>Furthermore, the size distribution of exosomes and microvesicles in our UC fractions were as expected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>) and approximately threefold fewer MVs are secreted by our cells, suggesting that it is exosomes rather than microvesicles that promote cell motility in our system.</s><s>However, to test the specificity of exosomes in carrying FN and promoting cell motility, we further purified our UC exosome preparations by sedimentation into a density gradient of Optiprep (DG exosomes).</s><s>Western blot analysis of the fractions revealed that FN was purified in two peaks-one that included the exosome markers HSP70 and flotillin along with the FN-binding integrin a5 subunit and another peak that did not have any of those markers and probably represents FN fibrils not associated with exosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>).</s><s>Microvesicle preparations contained no FN or HSP70 but did contain a small amount of flotillin and a5 integrin, which are both plasma membrane markers and may be found in both types of vesicles.</s><s>To determine whether our Optiprep-purified exosomes could rescue cell motility defects of Rab27a-KD cells, we coated plates and performed the same live-imaging assay as we had performed with UC-exosomes.</s><s>Compared with one-step UC-exosomes from the same conditioned media preparation, Optiprep-double purified exosomes were equipotent in their ability to rescue cell motility (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5d</ref>).</s><s>By comparison, the microvesicle fraction from the same  conditioned media was unable to rescue motility.</s><s>As with the UC-exosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4h</ref>), FN-depleted DG exosomes were less efficient in rescuing cell motility compared with control DG exosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>These data are consistent with our recent finding that recycling of endocytosed FN from a LE/Lys compartment drives cell motility <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and suggest that exosomes are key delivery vehicles for that FN.</s><s>Consistent with this model, we tested whether endocytosed fluorescent FN was likewise secreted by HT1080 cells migrating in the chick CAM.</s><s>Indeed, 24 h after i.v.</s><s>injection of DyLight550-FN-loaded HT1080 cells into the chick CAM, we observed incorporation of the endocytosed FN into streak-like structures reminiscent of adhesions associated with cellular protrusions (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Supplementary Movie 4).</s><s>To further verify that the secretion of exosomes rather than non-exosomal LE/Lys cargo is required for motility, we knocked down a component of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery that is necessary for intraluminal vesicle formation within MVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) is part of the ESCRT-0 complex, and inhibition of Hrs prevents exosome biogenesis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, refs 23,29).</s><s>As expected, Hrs KD diminished the release of exosomes into conditioned media (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a-c</ref>) and HT1080 HrsKD cells had motility defects in vivo (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>) and in vitro (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>, Exo 0 and 5g, FN 0 conditions).</s><s>Consistent with our hypothesis that matrix-containing exosomes promote cell motility, the in vitro motility speed defect of HT1080 HrsKD cells was fully rescued on culture dishes coated with either exosomes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>) or 10 mg ml À 1 purified FN (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure"

simultaneously visualize adhesions, we expressed GFP-paxillin.</s><s>As previously reported, CD63-positive tubules and vesicles were observed moving dynamically in cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref> and Supplementary Movie 5).</s><s>In some cases, these vesicular structures appeared to target peripheral adhesions (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref> and Supplementary Movie 5, arrows); however, the majority of the CD63 was in endosomes away from the plasma membrane and some CD63-positive endosomes also carried paxillin (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref> and Supplementary Movie 5, arrowhead).</s></p><p><s>To definitively identify exosome secretion sites, we constructed a novel imaging probe, which has the pH-sensitive GFP-pHLuorin moiety inserted into the first extracellular loop of CD63 (CD63-pHLuorin).</s><s>Because pHLuorin-GFP fluorescence is quenched at the acidic late endosomal pH, but fluoresces brightly at the neutral pH of the extracellular environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , it is ideal to track proteins that are exocytosed from endosomes.</s><s>To validate this construct, we co-expressed it with mCherry-Rab5-Q79L, which both marks and leads to the enlargement of early-to-late-transitioning endosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , in control and Rab27a-KD cells.</s><s>Consistent with the construct marking secretory MVE, pHLuorin-CD63 fluorescence was present on the cell surface of control cells, but not of Rab27a-KD cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>In addition, Bafilomycin treatment of Rab27a-KD cells to inhibit acidification of endosomes reveals its presence in internal vesicles.</s><s>Finally, since many Rab5-positive endosomes will not be fully acidified yet, note the internal co-localization of pHLuorin-CD63 with some Rab5-Q79L endosomes in control cells but less co-localization in Rab27a-KD cells, which should have an accumulation of secretory MVE downstream of early endosomes due to the docking defect <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To visualize exosome secretion in migrating cells, wide-field epifluorescence movies of HT1080 cells expressing pHLuorin-CD63 and mCherry-paxillin migrating in two-dimensinal were performed (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref> and Supplementary Movie 6).</s><s>Overall, pHLuorin-CD63 fluorescence was observed at the front of the cell in thick ruffles and at the back of the cell at attachment sites.</s><s>At the back of the cell, a striking feature was prominent 'slime trails' of fluorescence that were frequently left behind the migrating cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Examination of phase-contrast images from the same movies reveals that the rear of the cell is far in advance of the 'slime trails' and does not reveal any apparent bits of torn-off plasma membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, examination of mCherry-paxillin fluorescence gathered at the same time shows that only green fluorescence is present in the trail (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref> and Supplementary Movie 6).</s><s>These data suggest that the primary source of the slime trail is exosomes and not torn-off plasma membrane or large adhesions left behind.</s><s>These trails appeared to serve an adhesive function based on attachment to membrane at the rear of the cell that is particularly evident in the movies (Supplementary Movie 6).</s><s>To further analyse the localization of pHLuorin-CD63 with respect to leading-edge protrusions, higher speed movies were taken.</s><s>Kymographs showing protrusion at the leading edge over time were obtained and revealed that pHLuorin-CD63 was not enriched in the initial flat lamellipodial protrusions (Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref> and Supplementary Movie 7).</s><s>Instead there was an increased fluorescence in membranes that ruffled back, which could be due to membrane thickness or adhesion of exosomes after the initial membrane protrusion.</s></p><p><s>To further define the relationship between exosome secretion and adhesion formation, we performed live total internal reflected fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of cells expressing both pHLuorin-CD63 and mCherry-paxillin (Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref> and Supplementary Movie 8).</s><s>To visualize newly forming adhesions, movies were taken in actively spreading cells.</s><s>Interestingly, bursts of pHLuorin-CD63 closely preceded adhesion formation.</s><s>Analysis of these data revealed that 93% of adhesions were preceded by a burst of CD63-pHLuorin, with a median of 2 min lag between CD63 appearance and adhesion formation (Fig. <ref type="figure">7b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To specifically test the role of exosome secretion in adhesion formation, we analysed the dynamics of adhesions in GFP-paxillin-expressing control and Rab27a-KD cells.</s><s>Confocal movies taken in actively spreading cells revealed that Rab27a-KD cells have a selective defect in the rate of adhesion assembly (Fig. <ref type="figure">7d</ref>,e and Supplementary Movie 9).</s><s>There was no difference in the rate of adhesion disassembly (Fig. <ref type="figure">7f</ref>) or in the overall number of peripheral adhesions per frame of the movies (25.16±4.37 for HT1080 Scrambled , 27.65±3.08</s><s>(P ¼ 0.3229 compared with scrambled) for HT1080 Rab27aKD1 and 30.40±4.24 (P ¼ 0.2112 compared with scrambled) for HT1080 Rab27aKD2 , P by Student's t-test).</s><s>Overall, the slow adhesion assembly time led to a significant prolongation of the overall adhesion lifetime (average lifetime t 1/2 for HT1080 Scrambled adhesions ¼ 7.0 ± 0.4 min, compared with HT1080 Rab27aKD1 ¼ 10.7 ± 0.8 min (Po0.002,</s><s>Student's t-test) and HT1080 Rab27aKD2 ¼ 10.4 ± 1.0 min (Po0.002,</s><s>Student's

target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>FN is targeted to exosomes by interactions with integrins.</s><s>Our data indicate that FN becomes specifically targeted to exosomes in a form that promotes efficient adhesion formation.</s><s>Soluble FN becomes converted to a fibrillar, adhesion-promoting form in association with cellular integrin receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , which are also frequent exosome cargos.</s><s>To test whether targeting of FN to secreted exosomes depends on binding to integrins, we inhibited FN-integrin interactions and assessed the resulting FN content of exosomes.</s><s>Treatment of HT1080 cells with integrin-binding RGD peptide for 48 h greatly decreased the FN content of exosomes compared with cells treated with control RGE peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure">7g</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, inhibition of the FN-binding integrin a5b1 by KD of a5 also decreased the FN content of exosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure">7g</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that FN is targeted to exosomes by binding to cognate cellular integrin receptors, and then secreted in adhesive form to promote adhesion formation and effective cell motility.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Cell movement through tissues is a complex process that requires a coherent response to potentially divergent tissue cues.</s><s>Here we ARTICLE identify exosome secretion as a key autocrine mechanism to reinforce directional cues and support productive migration (see model in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>).</s><s>In vivo, inhibition of exosome formation, MVE docking or MVE fusion led to similar defects in cell migration speed and persistence.</s><s>In vitro, purified exosomes, but not shed microvesicles, were able to rescue speed defects of exosome-inhibited cells.</s><s>Both in vitro and in vivo, secretion of exosomes stabilizes nascent protrusions, a phenotype associated with cellular adhesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> .</s><s>In vitro live-imaging experiments further demonstrated that a key function of exosomes is to promote adhesion assembly.</s><s>A critical exosome cargo that drives the adhesion and speed of migrating cells is ECM, as demonstrated by the reduction in speed supported by FN-depleted exosomes and full rescue of speed defects in exosome-inhibited cells by purified FN.</s><s>Altogether, our results demonstrate that autocrine exosome secretion promotes both efficient and directional cell motility and indicates that a major function of ECM in exosomes is to promote adhesion formation and enhance cell speed.</s></p><p><s>While exosomes have been implicated in cell motility previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , it has not been clear how essential to the process they are or what specific steps are regulated.</s><s>Our data now demonstrate that autocrine secretion of exosomes controls both directional persistence and speed of cells migrating in vivo.</s><s>To understand in depth the role of exosome-delivered ECM in cell motility, we carried out a variety of live-imaging experiments to both visualize the spatiotemporal relationship between exosome secretion and motility structure formation and demonstrate specific defects of exosome-inhibited cells in adhesion assembly and cell speed but not in protrusion formation.</s><s>Altogether, these data reveal a much more important role for exosome secretion in adhesion formation than previously appreciated <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , and particularly highlight the key role of autocrine exosome secretion in motility processes.</s></p><p><s>A key question raised by our findings is why does the cell need to place FN on the outside of an exosome to promote adhesion assembly?</s><s>FN is initially secreted from Golgi-derived vesicles in a soluble non-adhesion-promoting form and then assembled into fibres through interaction with integrins on the cell surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>These fibres may not be optimally positioned to promote migration in one direction and their assembly may not be dynamic enough to respond to fluctuating directional cues.</s><s>By contrast, endocytosis and resecretion of FN-integrin complexes on exosomes likely facilitates dynamic placement of highly competent adhesive substrata that promote cellular motility.</s><s>In a previous study, we found that resecretion of fluorescent FN at the bottom of cells occurred within 1 h of its addition to the culture medium and was rapidly incorporated into nascent streak-like adhesion structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Presumably this endocytosis-resecretion process is happening continuously so that at any given time there may be a pool of matrix-carrying exosomes in MVE that could be rapidly secreted and used for migration.</s></p><p><s>FN is known to be endocytosed in association with integrins and targeted to MVE 8 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7g</ref>).</s><s>During the intraluminal vesiculation process that creates exosomes within the MVE, the FN would be placed on the outside of the exosome (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) bound to integrins in the correct topology to interact with both the outside of the cell and with other ECM such as the collagen fibres in the chick CAM (see model, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>).</s><s>In vitro, the major source of FN is serum.</s><s>In the tumour microenvironment, the potential sources of soluble FN are many, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and tumour cells, as well as leakage from the vasculature.</s><s>It is also likely that additional matrix molecules could play a similar role, depending on the receptor profile of the migrating cells.</s><s>In addition, matrix proteolysis could liberate adhesive fragments that could be internalized and then recycled on the outside of exosomes to promote dynamic adhesion formation and motility.</s></p><p><s>In addition to ECM, exosomes contain numerous cargoes that could impact cell motility in diverse contexts, including proteinases, growth, chemotactic and other extracellular factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, our in vivo data indicate that exosomes not only regulate cell speed but also directionality.</s><s>Because Rab27a-KD cells did not have a defect in persistence in our random motility in vitro assays, we were not able to address exosome control of directionality in that experimental set-up.</s><s>One possibility is that proteinases could facilitate persistent movement through tissues by remodelling impeding ECM.</s><s>Another possibility is that exosomes mediate directional movement via chemokines or other factors.</s><s>Specific identification of which exosome cargoes affect distinct aspects of cell motility is an important future area of research for both the exosome and motility fields.</s><s>In addition, juxtaposition of multiple motility-promoting factors in a single exosome or closely apposed exosomes could synergistically modulate complex motility behaviours.</s><s>Understanding these multivariate interactions will be an ongoing challenge for the field.</s></p><p><s>Use of the pHLuorin-CD63 probe to observe only extracellular CD63 allowed us to achieve a strong signal-to-noise ratio and observe dynamic relationships between exosome secretion and cellular structures.</s><s>Our observation of adhesive trails left behind migrating cells is reminiscent of slime trails left by lower organisms, including snails, slugs and slime moulds <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> .</s><s>Such slime trails contain complex mixtures of components and serve a variety of purposes, including providing adhesive traction without gluing the organism in place <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , and, in the case of slime moulds, as a chemorepellant to prevent recrossing of the same track <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>We speculate that trails of exosomes from mammalian cells may provide a similar mixture of functions, including not only adhesion but also the ability to modulate other cellular behaviours via diverse cargo molecules.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we identified a specific cellular organelle, the MVE, as critical to directional cell motility.</s><s>As polarization is an intrinsic part of directional movement, this finding is consistent with recent findings that targeted MVE secretion is important for formation of the posterior pole of polarized Dictyostelia <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>In addition, a recent study found that fibroblast-induced exosomes could mobilize Wnt11 from breast cancer cells to induce planar cell polarity signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, several molecules that have been previously shown to promote directional cell motility are sorted into exosomes and/or regulate their cargo content.</s><s>Thus, syndecans were recently shown to control exosome biogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> and also separately to control directional migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Likewise, Wnt molecules are major components of exosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> and together with syndecan-4 regulate directional cell motility in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>On the basis of these studies and our findings, we speculate that a number of molecules known to control directional cell motility may be doing so via control of exosome biogenesis or cargo content, or as biological cargoes of exosomes.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we have shown that exosome secretion is essential for directional and efficient cell migration and enhances migration speed by delivering ECM to promote adhesion formation.</s><s>These data identify a novel feedback pathway that enhances cell motility via local autocrine secretion.</s></p></div>
