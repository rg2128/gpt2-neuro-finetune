<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>PN responses vary depending on stimulus history.</s><s>We began by examining how stable or variable were odor-evoked individual PN responses when the same stimulus was delivered with different stimulus histories.</s><s>Variations in stimulus histories were introduced by delivering the same odorant ('target stimulus') in various distractor-target odor sequences.</s><s>A 500 ms inter-stimulus interval was used to separate the two stimuli delivered.</s><s>Five different odorants were used as distractor cues and two target stimuli were used in all our experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>It is worth noting that the distractor odorants comprised of four odorants belonging to different functional groups (2octanol (2oct)-an alcohol, isoamyl acetate (iaa)-an ester, benzaldehyde (bzald)an aldehyde, citral-a terpene), and a complex blend (apple).</s><s>The target odorant comprised of an odorant that has been shown previously as suitable for associative conditioning (hexanol), and an innately attractive odorant (geraniol) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We found that although responses of individual PNs during solitary introductions of the target stimulus were reliable across trials, they were altered when the same stimulus was delivered with different stimulus histories (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>When compared to the solitary target odor responses, the number of spikes increased for some stimulus histories (e.g.</s><s>PN2 2oct-hex vs. PN2 hex) but reduced for others (PN2 bzald-hex vs PN2 hex).</s><s>Further, note that increase/decrease in target stimulus response was not based on the chemical similarity between the two cues delivered in the sequence.</s><s>Our results indicate a simple rule for cross-talk: if a PN responded strongly to the first cue in the sequence (i.e., the distractor) then its response to the second stimulus (i.e. the target) was likely to be reduced.</s><s>Alternately, if the spiking activity reduced below baseline levels during exposure to the distractor cue, then its response to the following target increased in most cases (all comparison made with respect to the response evoked by the solitary target stimulus; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we examined how the variations observed at the individual PN level affected the ensemble neural representation of the target stimuli.</s><s>To visualize odor-evoked population PN responses, we used a dimensionality reduction analysis.</s><s>Individual PN responses were aligned with the odor onset and binned in 50 ms time windows.</s><s>The spike count per time bin of each PN became a vector component, and the spike counts of all recorded PNs in that same time bin were regarded as the high-dimensional neural response.</s><s>The time series of high-dimensional PN responses during the entire target stimulus presentation (4 s duration) was then projected along three principal component axes (Methods).</s><s>We found that introduction of the same stimulus generated not one ensemble neural response trajectory but a family of trajectories, one for each stimulus history.</s><s>Further, consistent with the earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , we found that all introductions of the target stimuli generated ensemble neural trajectories that included a fast-transient response component (~1-1.5 s from odor onset) that subsequently stabilized into steady state responses.</s><s>Notably, the direction of the highdimensional vectors (indicates variation in the set of PNs activated), and the direction of their evolution (variation in spatiotemporal patterning) during the target stimulus presentation varied in a history-dependent manner.</s><s>This can be clearly noted from the misalignment between the family of neural response trajectories generated during the exposure to the same target stimulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>, f, Supplementary Movies 1, 2).</s></p><p><s>How distinct or separable are these responses generated by the same stimulus?</s><s>To examine this, we used a supervised dimensionality reduction technique (linear discriminant analysis or LDA) that seeks to capture the differences between the ensemble neural responses evoked by the target odorant.</s><s>Projecting the data along the LDA axes, we found that the target stimulus-evoked PN responses created multiple, separable clusters, one for each stimulus history with which it was presented (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>, h, Supplementary Movies 3, 4).</s><s>This qualitative observation was further quantified using a classification analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>; see Methods).</s><s>Therefore, we conclude that both at the individual and population levels, PN responses that are thought to mediate identification of an olfactory stimulus in the insect olfactory system can vary significantly when the same stimulus is encountered with different histories.</s></p><p><s>Stimulus-history dependent contrast enhancement.</s><s>Are these variations in odor-evoked ensemble neural responses random?</s><s>To examine this issue, we compared the neural responses evoked by solitary and sequential presentations of the target stimulus with the distractor cue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Our results indicate each olfactory stimulus evoked a closed-loop trajectory that evolved in a unique direction.</s><s>As can be expected from our earlier analysis, the solitary and the sequential introductions of the same target stimulus generated two different neural response trajectories.</s><s>As a rule, compared to the solitary target stimulus response, when presented following the distractor cue, the ensemble response trajectory shifted further away from the responses evoked by the distractor cue.</s><s>This is consistent with individual and ensemble PN response analyses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) where we found that during sequential presentations of the target stimulus, common neurons were suppressed (i.e.</s><s>responds to both target and the preceding distractor stimulus), whereas those that responded uniquely to the target odorant tended to increase.</s></p><p><s>As a direct consequence, the angular separation between neural response trajectories of the target and distractor cues increased, which can be expected to enhance discriminability between these two odorants (i.e.</s><s>contrast enhancement).</s><s>To quantify this, we used a correlation analysis where we compared the similarity between ensemble PN activities evoked by the target stimulus and the distractor cue.</s><s>We made this comparison for both the solitary exposure of the target stimulus and the sequential presentations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>; similar analysis but for later response segments shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>As can be noted, the correlation between the distractor cue and the target stimulus significantly reduced during sequential presentation of the target stimulus.</s><s>Further, the shift in the ensemble responses were predictable using a linear approximation where the target odor response was added with the target-minus-distractor response (i.e.</s><s>uniqueness; see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Hence, our results indicate that alterations in the ensemble neural responses allow the antennal lobe circuit to enhance the uniqueness of the target stimulus with respect to the preceding cue i.e., dynamic, history-dependent contrast enhancement.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Same stimulus can activate varying combinations of neurons.</head><p><s>To enhance contrast with different distractor odorants, the same target stimulus must activate a different subset of the PNs.</s><s>So, we wondered if there exists a unique set of neurons that is activated during all the target stimulus presentations to allow stable recognition.</s><s>To understand this, we classified the PN responses into 'responsive' or 'non-responsive' categories (Methods).</s><s>We found that the percentage of neurons activated and the composition of the set of responding neurons varied when the same target stimulus was presented with different histories (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Further, the percentage of PNs that consistently responded to all introductions of hexanol and geraniol (the two target stimuli) was a smaller fraction of the set that responded to the solitary introductions of these two target stimuli.</s></p><p><s>To represent the identity of the target stimulus, the set of neurons must be consistent as well as unique.</s><s>So, we examined how many of these consistent neurons were also unique responders i.e. respond to target stimuli alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, we found that there was not a single PN that responded uniquely and consistently to hexanol in all the conditions.</s><s>Only 2% neurons responded uniquely and consistently to geraniol presented with different stimulus histories.</s><s>Therefore, our results indicate that combinatorial code involving a consistent and unique set of neurons may not be a suitable approach for achieving stable recognition of a sensory stimulus encountered with varying stimulus histories.</s></p><p><s>Temporal response features also vary with stimulus history.</s><s>How robust are temporal features such as response latency and pattern of stimulus-evoked spike trains in allowing stable odor recognition?</s><s>To examine this, we defined the response latency as the first time bin when a neuron's response exceeded a certain threshold value (Methods; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>We then classified neurons as early responders (latency &lt;600 ms) or late/ non-responders (latency &gt;600 ms).</s><s>Note that the early responders were PNs that responded before behavioral response onset (median ~600 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> ).</s><s>For visualization, we represented this classification of the response latency across the ensemble of PNs as a color bar (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>The response latency vector was generated for different introductions of the target stimulus and is shown as a color bar to allow comparisons.</s><s>Our results indicate that depending on the stimulus history, some of the early responding projection neurons to the solitary presentations of the target stimulus became late/non-responsive in the sequential presentations, while some of the late/non-responders became early responders.</s><s>Furthermore, only a small subset of neurons consistently responded early to the target stimuli.</s><s>Similar to the combinations of PNs activated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), the sets of consistent early responders that were also unique responders to the target stimuli were empty or near empty sets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>How robust are other features of PN responses such as the pattern of their stimulus-evoked spike trains?</s><s>To examine this, we considered the evolution of trial-averaged PN spike counts over time (during the 4 s of target stimulus presentation) as the temporal response vector.</s><s>We computed the correlation between the PN temporal response vectors generated by the same target stimulus presented with different stimulus histories (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>The distribution of this temporal pattern similarity metric for each target-history combination revealed that more correlation values were closer to a value of 'zero' rather than 'one' (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>This indicated that the temporal patterns of PN spiking activities also change considerably with stimulus history.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, these results indicate that temporal features of PN responses are also highly variable and may not allow robust recognition of a stimulus when it is encountered with different stimulus histories.</s></p><p><s>Robust behavioral recognition.</s><s>Our electrophysiological results indicated that combinations of neurons and their temporal response features changed when the same stimulus was presented with different histories.</s><s>Therefore, we wondered whether locusts can behaviorally recognize a conditioned stimulus if it is presented in a similar fashion.</s><s>To determine this, we trained locusts using an appetitive-conditioning paradigm.</s><s>Briefly, during the training phase, starved locusts were presented a conditioned Each row corresponds to one trial and PN responses in ten consecutive trials are shown for assessing the repeatability of observed spiking response patterns.</s><s>The duration when the distractor (blue) and target (red) stimuli were presented are shown using colored boxes.</s><s>As can be noted, the target stimulus (hex) can be presented solitarily (top panel) or following one of the five different distractor cues: history1-2octanol (2oct), history2-isoamyl acetate (iaa), history3-benzaldehyde (bzald), history4-citral (cit), and history5-apple (app).</s><s>d Similar plots as in c but showing responses of two more PNs to presentations of geraniol (ger) with different stimulus histories.</s><s>e Responses of 85 PNs projected onto the first three principal components are shown.</s><s>Each spoke represents the ensemble neural activities in a 50 ms time bin after PCA dimensionality reduction.</s><s>Arrows indicate direction of evolution of the stimulus-evoked responses over time.</s><s>The six trajectories shown correspond to PN responses observed following the introductions of the target stimulus either solitarily or in one of five stimulus sequences.</s><s>f Similar trajectory plots as in e but visualizing ensemble PN responses evoked by introductions of geraniol (ger) with different stimulus histories.</s><s>g Population PN responses are shown after linear discriminant analysis dimensionality reduction (n = 85 PNs).</s><s>Each 3D-sphere represents an 85-dimensional PN activity vector in a 50 ms time bin.</s><s>Eighty data points corresponding to ensemble neural activities evoked during 4 s of hexanol exposure with a particular stimulus history are assigned the same color.</s><s>h Similar plot as in g but showing responses elicited during geraniol exposures stimulus (hexanol;
