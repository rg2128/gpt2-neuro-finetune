<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantifying GECI-based action potential detection</head><p><s>One promising area of application for GECIs is in all-optical monitoring of action potentials.</s><s>It is therefore important to quantify the ability to infer action potentials from GECI fluorescence.</s><s>We quantified our ability to detect action potentials under the highly-favorable conditions of brain slice recordings.</s><s>A template-matching algorithm was able to detect single action potentials with nearly 100% certainty, provided the time of the action potential was known.</s><s>However, when we simulated the case in which the time of the action potential was unknown, detection rates, given reasonable false-positive rates, dropped dramatically.</s><s>For example, we determined the percentage of action potential trains (for trains of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 40 action potentials at 83 Hz) that could be detected at a 5% false positive rate during 1 second of data acquisition (i.e., such that when a time series is divided into subsequent intervals of 1 second length, 5% of these intervals will contain a false positive event).</s><s>With trains of four or more action potentials, GCaMP2 at room temperature allowed us to detect 100% of the action potential trains (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>However, with a single action potential, GCaMP2 allowed detection of fewer than half of the action potentials.</s><s>At near-physiological temperatures, it took about 5 action potentials at 83 Hz to achieve 80% detection rate with GCaMP2, and only the 40 action potential train gave 100% detection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Previous versions of GCaMP yielded lower levels of detection (GCaMP1.6,</s><s>GCaMP1.6-CAM(E140K); Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), illustrating the improvement of GCaMP2 over its predecessors.</s></p><p><s>Spine NMDAR-mediated [Ca 2+ ] transients detected by GCaMP2 targeted to the actin cytoskeleton NMDA-receptor mediated calcium accumulations can be imaged as a read-out of synaptic transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>We asked how well GCaMP2 fluorescence could signal NMDARmediated calcium transients in spines.</s><s>We enriched GCaMP2 at spines by fusion to actin (Figure <ref type="figure">6A</ref>).</s><s>We then tested the  39%-264% DF/F), with larger DF/F values corresponding to increased NMDAR current (Figure <ref type="figure">6E</ref>).</s><s>However, GCaMP2 and GCaMP2-actin were both quite dim and it was therefore sometimes difficult to locate spines (Figure <ref type="figure">6B</ref>).</s><s>Further, because GCaMP2-actin is targeted to the actin cytoskeleton and is not rapidly replaced by freely-diffusible cytosolic GECI, we found photobleaching to be a greater problem with GCaMP2-actin than with plain GCaMP2.</s><s>In general, photobleaching is likely to present a greater problem with targeted GECIs than with their non-targeted counterparts, due to slowed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GECI brightness</head><p><s>An important property to consider in evaluating a GECI is its basal level of brightness.</s><s>A GECI's signal-to-noise ratio, SNR ,N 1/2 DF/F, increases in proportion to the square root of the number (N) of photons collected and to the DF/F signal change.</s><s>Maximizing the number of photons collected from the specimen is thus critical.</s><s>What factors affect GECI brightness in a living neuron?</s><s>The number of collected photons, N , a c r, is proportional to GECI concentration (c) and to the photon rate (r), and to instrumentation properties (a).</s><s>GECI concentration, c = k f / k d , is determined by the rate of functional protein formation (k f ) and the rate constant of protein destruction (k d ).</s><s>At any moment in time the photon rate is proportional to quantum yield and decreases with the rate of quantum bleaching.</s><s>Therefore, GECI brightness is affected both by properties of the cellular environment and by properties intrinsic to the GECI molecule.</s><s>Here we made a rough relative measurement of brightness that confounds these different factors but that allows a gross comparisons across GECIs.</s><s>We illuminated GECI-expressing pyramidal cells in hippocampal slice culture with 7 mW at the objective back aperture, and recorded the fluorescence intensity over a linescan image taken at the base of the apical dendrite (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>; note that different filter sets were used for the FRET-based and the GFPbased GECIs; see Materials and Methods).</s><s>GCaMP2 was about 30-fold dimmer than EGFP on average (it was for this reason that we co-transfected GCaMP2-related constructs with mCherry to easily identify transfected cells).</s><s>The FRET-based TN-XL was the brightest GECI tested.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In neurons, transient changes in intracellular calcium accompany action potentials and are often used as a reporter of neuronal

system function.</s><s>However, synthetic dyes suffer from several practical limitations, including: 1) they are difficult to load into populations of neurons in vivo; 2) they cannot readily be targeted to specific cell types or subcellular locations; and 3) they do not readily permit long-term chronic imaging in vivo.</s><s>All these limitations can be potentially addressed by genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs).</s></p><p><s>In this report we have quantitatively characterized the action potential responses of GCaMP-based GECIs under nearly ideal imaging conditions in the brain slice, and with the high expression levels possible with gene gun transfection and/or in utero electroporation.</s><s>We also quantified the ability of GCaMP2 to allow detection of action potentials, under our particular expression and imaging conditions.</s><s>At near-physiological temperatures, about 5 action potentials at 83 Hz were required to achieve an 80% detection rate (for a false positive rate of 5%) with GCaMP2.</s><s>GCaMP2 did not allow consistent detection of single action potentials, even at room temperature where calcium extrusion kinetics are slower.</s><s>It is therefore unlikely that GCaMP2 will allow faithful monitoring, at single action potential resolution, of a population of individual pyramidal neurons at mammalian physiological temperatures.</s><s>At the moment, GCaMP2 may be suited to a preparation where neurons fire bursts of APs.</s></p><p><s>Cellular and subcellular targeting of GECIs holds great promise as a means to

targeting of GECIs, we targeted GCaMP2 to various subcellular locations, including to the plasma membrane and to dendritic spines.</s><s>Surprisingly, we found no improvement in signal change for all three different membranetargeted GECIs.</s></p><p><s>Since the dominant source of action potential-induced dendritic Ca 2+ influx is through voltage-gated calcium channels in the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, it may be possible for GECIs targeted to the plasma membrane to sense higher peak [Ca 2+ ].</s><s>In principle, therefore, by targeting GECIs to locations at or near the plasma membrane, it may be possible to achieve greater DF/F signals than with diffusible GECIs.</s><s>Why, then, did membrane targeting not yield an improvement?</s><s>One hypothesis is that these calmodulin-based sensors could interact with endogenous calmodulin <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, interfering with their function through unwanted binding reactions.</s><s>It is also possible that the membrane-targeted GECIs did not show improvements due to effects of the targeting sequence(s) on folding and stability of the GECI, even though we used three different membrane targeting sequences.</s><s>It is also possible that the slow kinetics of the GECI fluorescence response (,100 ms) reflects calcium binding kinetics that are too slow to capture the [Ca 2+ ] transient close to the membrane before dissipation by diffusion.</s><s>Another possibility is that sensor proteins or their fluorophores are not stable in the local environment near the plasma membrane.</s><s>Finally, fluorescent proteins targeted to the plasma membrane with different lipid anchors can show clustering into membrane microdomains <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and it is not clear how our Prior efforts to express GECIs in transgenic mice have yielded mixed results.</s><s>Some transgenic mouse lines were found to have only very small GECI DF/F signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> compared to in vitro measurements of the GECIs' dynamic ranges, consistent with earlier studies in invertebrates.</s><s>This lead to speculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that relatively high levels of GECI expression could overwhelm interference from endogenous calmodulin.</s><s>In addition, it is possible that long-term expression of GECI calcium buffers could affect cell physiology or trigger silencing of GECI gene expression.</s><s>However, we found robust GCaMP2 responses in juvenile mice that had been electroporated in utero at embryonic day 16.</s><s>GCaMP2 was driven by the CAG promoter, which is known to give expression early in development <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, expression of GCaMP2 in layer 2/3 pyramids for up to weeks during development did not prevent it from functioning properly and did not obviously interfere with the health of the expressing neurons.</s><s>This result is consistent with studies finding calcium responses after long-term expression of camgaroo-2 and inverse pericam under the aCaMKII promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, with a study showing functional GCaMP2 expression in cerebellum of transgenic mice under the Kv3.1 potassium channel promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and with a study showing long-term expression of functional GCaMP2 in cardiac myocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Areas for improvement of GECIs include baseline brightness, dynamic range, and accelerating the response kinetics to Ca 2+ to best match expected patterns of action potential activity.</s><s>To further improve GCaMP2, it will be helpful to obtain the highresolution structures of calcium-bound and calcium-unbound states, as well as to develop rapid screening and testing systems designed to assay responses to action potential-like stimuli.</s><s>In particular, it will be valuable to have a screening system that allows measurement of an effective benchmark for quantifying actionpotential responses (an ''AP 50 ''), as it is difficult to predict action potential responses from equilibrium measurements.</s></p></div>
