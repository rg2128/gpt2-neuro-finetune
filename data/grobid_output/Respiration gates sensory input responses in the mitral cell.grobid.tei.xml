<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optical stimulation</head><p><s>Optical stimulation of ORN axon terminals in the glomerular layer was performed using a 700mW 455nm laser fiber coupled to a custom-built digital micro-mirror device (DMD, Zinterscope, Guilford, CT).</s><s>The DMD projector was connected via an HDMI cable and had a resolution of 1024x768 pixels (8-bit grey scale, 60 frames per second).</s><s>Images are projected on an Olympus UPlanFLN 4x n.a.</s><s>0.13 objective, yielding an image size of 4x3 mm (4x4 μm projected pixel size) that was focused on the dorsal OB.</s><s>The maximum power projected on the OB (laser at a 90% duty cycle and the entire DMD image turned on) was 100mW.</s><s>This stimulation setup was designed around a modified Olympus Bx50WI microscope.</s><s>Custom Matlab and Python scripts were used to control the DMD and the electrophysiology acquisition program from Tucker Davis Technologies, as well as to store and analyze data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulation paradigms</head><p><s>Spatiotemporal coding of multiple dorsal glomerular inputs by a mitral cell was investigated using single light block stimulations that were presented one at a time onto the dorsal glomerular layer.</s><s>The optical stimulus was comprised of a sequence of single blocks of light that were projected with a pseudo-random location on to the dorsal surface of the olfactory bulb <ref type="bibr">(S1 Fig)</ref>.</s><s>By only presenting one light block stimulus at a time and by spatially spreading out the regions of stimulation, we prevented sequential stimulations to the same regions and greatly reduced the surface area of optical stimulation on to the bulb.</s><s>Light blocks were small (25x25 pixels, 100x100 μm) and matched to the average size of a glomerulus (50-120 μm diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>).</s><s>These block stimulations were presented one at a time for 100 or 200 millisecond durations.</s><s>Each stimulus was separated by an inter-stimulus interval of 200 milliseconds.</s></p><p><s>No stimulus repeatedly sampled the exact same glomerular region; rather the overlap of unique stimulus blocks was used to sample each dorsal glomerular region many times.</s><s>By pseudo-randomly centering each block of light onto a unique location of the dorsal olfactory bulb, we did not bias our stimuli to a particular edge of a glomerulus or possibly activate two neighboring glomeruli repeatedly.</s><s>We choose to not use a grid of stimulation blocks, but rather sample unique regions in a pseudo random order so that we could smoothly sample the edges of dorsal glomeruli.</s><s>In contrast, a fixed stimulus grid is biased in that many stimulation blocks may miss the center of a given glomerulus and only target the edges of glomeruli, resulting in the possible mixture of primary excitatory responses and possible neighboring inhibitory responses.</s><s>Stimulation with this paradigm lasted on average 35 minutes and included approximately 5,800 stimulations presented onto the dorsal olfactory bulb per single unit recording.</s><s>Note that the same glomerulus was not stimulated repeatedly, rather a small block of light was used to sequentially sample all regions of the dorsal bulb independently.</s><s>Heatmaps were generated from spikes recorded during each light block stimulus.</s><s>Excitatory and inhibitory glomerular inputs were identified as the region of stimulation that activated or inhibited the recorded MTC the strongest.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis: respiratory activity correction</head><p><s>The respiratory cycle was recorded using a thermistor.</s><s>Respiratory phase angles corresponding to the onset of each random block stimulus were stored and used to generate temporally specific spatial response heatmaps.</s><s>Determination of the respiratory phase angle (1 ms resolution) allowed for a precise characterization of respiration mediated phasic activity, which varied across the respiratory cycle.</s><s>This method enabled each block stimulus to be sorted by its spatial position and/or the phase angle in which it was presented during the respiratory cycle.</s><s>To isolate light stimulus evoked responses, the spontaneous respiration-evoked activity was subtracted.</s><s>The average plus a minimum of one standard deviation of MTC activity during control (i.e, baseline, non-stimulated) periods was subtracted at each specific angle of respiration in which stimulation occurred.</s><s>This resulted in the generation of heatmaps that display only spatially isolated stimulus-evoked responses (significantly greater than the average respiratory activity produced when no stimulus was present).</s></p><p><s>More specifically, all stimulus onset times were aligned to a phase in one half of the respiratory cycle (inhalation and exhalation), where each half's phase was separately and linearly scaled to time.</s><s>The peak and trough of each respiratory cycle, as recorded by the thermistor, were defined as 0 (equivalent to 2π) and π radians, respectively.</s><s>Recorded spikes were also assigned to a respiratory cycle angle, resulting in a vector of all recorded spikes relative to the peak and trough of respiration for each individual respiratory cycle.</s><s>Angles were assigned to every millisecond of the longest recorded respiratory cycle, thus ensuring all angles for all recorded respiratory cycles were at a resolution of at least 1 ms.</s><s>Several diagnostic simulator scripts were created that generated sets of test data that were subsequently analyzed to validate these analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heatmaps</head><p><s>After K-means spike sorting (Tucker-Davis Technologies, OpenSorter), heatmaps of MTC spiking activity evoked by optical stimulation of all dorsal glomeruli were generated.</s><s>Control respiratory activity associated with each response window was subtracted.</s><s>Response windows began at, or shortly after, the onset of the light stimulus and terminated at least 50 ms before the end of the stimulation period.</s><s>Control windows were selected to start at least 50 ms after light was turned off and end before the light was turned on.</s></p><p><s>Heatmaps displayed the stimulus-evoked MTC responses across the dorsal bulb.</s><s>Evoked responses were shown by color-coding the stimulus blocks according to the number of spikes that the blocks evoked during the stimulus presentation, minus the number of spikes that occurred under control conditions during the same phases of the respiration cycle during which the block stimulation occurred.</s><s>Heatmaps represented the average evoked response of all the random blocks of light presented in a trial, or a subset of blocks occurring within a specified range of phases within the respiratory cycle.</s><s>Gaussian filters (sigma was set to 4 pixel units for excitatory regions of interest and 10 for inhibitory regions of interest) were used when generating heatmap images.</s></p><p><s>From these heatmaps, primary sites of excitation and inhibition were identified.</s><s>Excitatory regions of interest (ROI) were identified as sites that significantly excited the recorded neuron to levels above average respiratory activity plus multiple standard deviations (described in the results).</s><s>The respiration-driven activity associated with the respiratory cycle angles of each stimulation window was subtracted to isolate discrete excitatory or inhibitory dorsal glomerular regions.</s><s>Responses to all stimulation blocks intersecting those excitatory ROIs were isolated and used to generate polar plots of MTC activity to stimulation at glomerular sites across twelve phases of the respiratory cycle.</s><s>These polar plots were generated to examine how stimulation of single glomerular inputs can gate mitral/tufted cell activity across various phases of the respiratory cycle.</s></p><p><s>Inhibitory ROIs were also identified by generating heatmaps where the respiratory activity was not subtracted.</s><s>This allowed us to isolate sites of dorsal glomeruli that reduced MTC activity below average control levels of respiratory activity.</s><s>These ROIs were isolated as dark regions in the heatmap as they were associated with sites of stimulation that reduced baseline levels of MTC activity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directional statistics</head><p><s>Polar plots were used to examine changes in MTC activity across the respiratory cycle.</s><s>Stimulations were sorted by the phase angle they occurred at relative to the respiratory cycle.</s><s>Evoked and control responses corresponding to specific phases of respiration were compared.</s><s>Directional statistics (Matlab Circular Statistics Toolbox written by Philipp Berens in 2006) confirmed respiratory phasic activity in each recording (Rayleigh's test for non-uniformity) and allowed us to identify significant shifts in MTC activity following optical stimulation (non parametric multi-sample test for equal medians, similar to a Kruskal-Wallis test for linear data).</s><s>Changes in MTC centroid angle (radians) were examined.</s><s>A centroid is the vector mean of all data points in the plot under a given condition.</s><s>Group statistics, mean, standard deviations (SD), and standard error of the mean (SE) were compared.</s><s>Two-tailed unpaired t-tests (across simulated and control groups) were used to compare changes in centroid angle, and peak and average firing rates.</s><s>Peristimulus histograms were plotted in time and aligned by the onset of the stimulus (time = 0 sec).</s><s>Stimulations were grouped by their onset times relative to the respiration cycle.</s></p><p><s>Diagnostic model.</s><s>To verify the data analysis code, artificial data were created with known statistical properties.</s><s>We used periodic Gaussian stimulus event probability distributions whose peaks aligned with defined respiration cycle phase angles.</s><s>These data sets were created with Matlab scripts we made available in ModelDB (accession number 183300).</s><s>They were used to verify the experimental analysis code for each set of electrophysiological and computationally modeled data.</s><s>This diagnostic data confirmed that the analysis code returned the correct results from data with known properties.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling</head><p><s>The role of respiration in mediating inhibition and sensory input was investigated using a model containing two

included a burst of action potentials that was synchronized to the respiratory cycle's transition from inhalation to exhalation.</s><s>Respiration mediated burst firing was set to occur at 2.5 Hz in all simulations unless otherwise specified in the results.</s><s>As in the electrophysiological experiments, recordings were made from a single cell, here modeled as a mitral cell.</s><s>The mitral cell (MC) received either periglomerular (PG) inhibition, granule cell (GC) inhibition, both PG and GC (PG+GC) inhibition, or no lateral inhibition.</s><s>All possible network combinations were explored.</s><s>The design of the model was guided by the microcircuit connectivity information of glomerular-mitral cells columns and associated periglomerular and granule cell lateral inhibitory synaptic connections: see Fig 5 .5 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The model was written in <ref type="bibr">NEURON 7.4 [29]</ref> and incorporated previously published models of mitral, periglomerular, and granule cells from selected network model codes available in ModelDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Our periglomerular inhibition incorporates both inter-and intra-glomerular connections and therefore our findings from this model may resemble activities in a myriad of subtypes of periglomerular cells and short axon cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The mitral cell and granule cell models were from ModelDB, accession number 144054 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and the periglomerular cell was from ModelDB, accession number 149739 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Respiratory mediated events were present on each column (mitral cell tuft), while the simulated input mimicking the light stimulus in our in vivo experiments was applied to either the parent glomerulus (the same MC that was recorded, primary glomerulus input model), or an adjacent column's mitral cell (secondary glomerulus input model).</s></p><p><s>A second model, the glomeruli connectivity model, further investigated how glomerular inhibition can shape respiratory gating of sensory inputs by varying the number of connected glomeruli and associated mitral and inhibitory interneurons (glomerular columns).</s><s>Basic glomerular columns were modeled in the same fashion as the primary and secondary

Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We used the excitatory and inhibitory synapses from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> for the AMPA-NMDA and

target="#b31">[32]</ref> for all excitatory and inhibitory synapses and kept it constant in each stimulation (no synaptic plasticity).</s><s>For the granule cells we used higher levels of inhibition, specifically 4 times greater than the periglomerular cells unless otherwise stated in the results.</s><s>Up to 90 times higher granule synaptic inputs as compared to periglomerular synaptic inputs were investigated to explore the onset and upper range of granule cell effects, as their inhibitory effects were weaker than those observed in response to periglomerular inhibition.</s></p><p><s>Although not the main focus of this paper, we also investigated the possibility that external tufted cells (ETCs) may affect the gating of sensory input evoked MTC excitation.</s><s>Excitatory synapses (AMPA-NMDA) were created between external tufted cells and periglomerular neurons and between external tufted cells and the apical tuft of the mitral cells.</s><s>All other synaptic connections remained the same.</s><s>The ETC was created by halving the size of the mitral cell model and removing the secondary dendrites.</s></p><p><s>We systematically varied the intensity of respiration versus stimulus-evoked inputs.</s><s>We used a Gaussian Poisson rate with a half width of 30 ms to model the occurrence of excitatory events for either respiration or light driven stimulus.</s><s>The Gaussian light stimulus events were convenient to study the relative strengths of respiration versus light stimulation.</s><s>Combinations of R (respiration Gaussian peak Poisson rates) and S (sensory Gaussian peak Poisson rates) were used in these simulations: R and S were varied from 20 to 760 Hz in steps of 20 Hz (1444 combinations).</s><s>A table that relates the R and S peak of the Gaussian Poisson rates to average numbers of excitatory events per respiratory cycle and event rates (Hz) is provided in S2 Fig.</s></p><p><s>When multiplied by the 4 network types (PG, GC, PG+GC and no inhibition) and 2 stimulation choices (primary versus secondary glomerulus inputs), this resulted in 11552 model runs.</s></p><p><s>An additional 5776 simulations tested higher levels of GC inhibition (30, 50, 70, and 90 times greater than the PG input).</s><s>Additional simulation with R and S values within
