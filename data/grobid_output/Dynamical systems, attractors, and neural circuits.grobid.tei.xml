<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>When we try to understand any biological process, our models of the system matter.</s><s>Our ideas of how a parameter impacts the system or how a variable responds to manipulations of the system determine what questions we attempt to answer and which experiments we perform.</s><s>These ideas are based on our own mental models, which can be misleading if not founded on the appropriate dynamical principles 1,2 .</s></p><p><s>In this article, I hope to provide a short introduction to the types of dynamical system that arise in neural circuits.</s><s>In doing so, I explore why there is a perhaps surprising lack of consensus on the nature of the dynamics within mammalian neural circuits-modelers aiming to explain various cognitive processes commence from seemingly incompatible starting points, such as chaotic systems, oscillators, or sets of point attractor states.</s><s>I briefly consider hallmarks and support for each paradigm and summarize how-in spite of the tremendous quantity of electrophysiological data-room for debate remains as to which type of dynamical system is best used to model and understand brain function.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hidden variables within neural data</head><p><s>Neural circuits are nonlinear dynamical systems that, in principle, can be described by coupled differential equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">3</ref> .</s><s>However, the relevant continuous variables necessary for a full description of the behavior of a functioning neural circuit are typically hidden from us.</s><s>Minimally these include the membrane potential of every cell, but recordings of neural activity in behaving vertebrates such as mammals are limited to a small subset of cells.</s><s>Even if all recorded cells reside in one circuit that we wish to describe, the circuit, which could be distributed or compact, receives inputs from tens of thousands of other neurons, whose activity is unknown.</s><s>Moreover, even a continuous variable such as membrane potential is most commonly observed only at the discrete times of voltage spikes.</s><s>Therefore, our descriptions of neural circuits require us to infer the behavior of underlying hidden variables when we observe only a sparse number of them.</s></p><p><s>Numerous other properties impact the ongoing behavior of a cell and the circuit as a whole.</s><s>These may include the number of vesicles of neurotransmitter and their voltage-dependent release probabilities at each synaptic connection or the cell-average states of activation and inactivation of the various ion channels.</s><s>Calcium concentration and spatial distributions of all these values can also affect neural activity.</s><s>Such an overwhelming abundance of known unknowns makes a full or complete description impossible and helps explain why we not only fail to have a concrete, detailed explanation of the behavior of most neural circuits but even do not know which dynamical system provides the best model of the behavior.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classes of dynamical system</head><p><s>A dynamical system is any system that changes in time and can be described by a set of coupled differential equations.</s><s>A pendulum is a simple example, the Hodgkin-Huxley model of a neuron a more complicated one, and the coordinated activity of all neurons in a brain an intractable one.</s><s>To characterize a dynamical system rigorously, one should know how the rate of change of all relevant variables depends on the combination of their instantaneous values.</s><s>One then can simulate how they change in time from any initial condition and plot these co-varying variables together as a trajectory.</s><s>If a small change in initial conditions leads to identical behavior after some transient period, then the system possesses a point attractor state-trajectories converge if their initial difference is not too large.</s><s>If the system is an oscillator, trajectories converge to a particular loop-a limit cycle-in which differences in initial conditions are maintained over time as a fixed phase offset.</s><s>If trajectories diverge from each other across a broad range of initial conditions while all variables remain bounded, then the system is chaotic.</s></p><p><s>Here we consider circuits with only two or three neurons to provide examples of many different types of dynamics.</s><s>In general, a system with hundreds or thousands of neurons-so that we would need a space of hundreds or thousands of dimensions to plot the dynamics as the coordinated set of membrane potentials or firing rates of all neurons-could contain point attractors, limit cycles, and regions of chaos depending on which subsets of cells were more strongly active for one period of time.</s><s>The richness of such highdimensional systems and their relevance to cognitive function make them an important area of current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Point attractors</head><p><s>A point attractor state is equivalent to a stable fixed point of the dynamics, such as the bottom of a bowl with a ball in it.</s><s>No neural circuit in vivo can strictly be in a point attractor state, as that would require all variables (such as membrane potentials) to be static.</s><s>However, it may be reasonable to consider a broad average across variables, such as the mean firing rate of a large group of neurons, to be stationary following any initial transient response to a fixed input.</s><s>Simple systems without feedback operate in such point attractor states if cells have one value of firing rate in the absence of stimulus and, typically following a period of adaptation, shift to a different stable firing rate in the presence of a stimulus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Neurons in the sensory periphery appear to behave in this manner.</s></p><p><s>Variability in the spiking of a neuron-both within a trial and between trials-appears to be at odds with a point attractor description, which suggests a stable, stationary set of firing rates.</s><s>However, such variability can be attributed to various noise terms that lead to each neuron's spikes being produced randomly (say, as a Poisson process) with probability that depends on the rate-a hidden variable, which could be static and deterministic-and/or to noise-driven fluctuations in the rate about its stable fixed point.</s><s>Thus, a point attractor framework is not incompatible with ever-varying neural activity, especially, as we shall discuss below, for systems with many attractor states.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multistability and memory</head><p><s>When a system possesses multiple point attractor states in the absence of stimuli, then the history of prior stimuli can determine the neural circuit's current activity state-the particular attractor in which it resides-so the system can retain memories (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In some of the most important pioneering work in computational and theoretical neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref> , Grossberg and Hopfield demonstrated how such discrete memory states can form via activitydependent changes in the strength of connections between coactive neurons during stimulus presentation.</s><s>While the initial analyses of During each current step, a new attractor is produced, but following current offset the original activity state is reached.</s><s>(D) Any particular combination of the firing rates of the two units (x-axis is rate of unit 1, y-axis is rate of unit 2) determines the way those firing rates change in time (arrows).</s><s>Starting from any pair of firing rates, any trajectory following arrows terminates at the point of intersection of the two lines.</s><s>Red line: nullcline for unit 2-the value of r(2) at which dr(2)/dt = 0 (its fixed point) given a value of r(1).</s><s>Since unit 1 excites unit 2, the fixed point for r(2) increases with r(1).</s><s>Black line: nullcline for unit 1-the value of r(1) at which dr(1)/dt = 0 (its fixed point) given a value of r(2).</s><s>Since unit 2 inhibits neuron 1, the fixed point for r(1) decreases with r(2).</s><s>The crossing point of the nullclines is a fixed point of the whole system.</s><s>The fixed point is stable (so is an attractor state) because arrows converge on the fixed point.</s><s>(E) As in (D) but the solution during the second pulse of applied current.</s><s>The applied current shifts the nullcline for r(1) so that the fixed point of the system is at much higher values of r(1) and r(2).</s><s>For parameters, see supporting Matlab code, "dynamics_two_units.m".</s></p><p><s>the capacity (number of memories held) of such networks relied on binary neurons that were either on or off and updated in discrete time steps 12 , the principle of memory formation and memory retrieval via an imperfect stimulus has been demonstrated in continuous firing rate models in continuous time <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">15</ref> and in circuits of model spiking neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">16</ref> .</s><s>These pattern-learning systems, known generically as autoassociative networks, provide great insight into how memories can be distributed across overlapping sets of cells and retrieved from imperfect stimuli via pattern completion to a point attractor state.</s></p></div>
