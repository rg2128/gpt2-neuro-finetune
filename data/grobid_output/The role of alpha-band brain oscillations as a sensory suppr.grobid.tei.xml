<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>density multi-channel electro-and magneto-encephalographic recordings (EEG and MEG) have allowed for unprecedented advances in our understanding of the physiology of human selective attention.</s><s>This report specifically addresses evidence for the role of oscillatory brain mechanisms in selective attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Vanni et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Foxe et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Gruber et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Shibata et al.,

target="#b31">Rihs et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Snyder and Foxe, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Two basic varieties of attentionally mediated, selective modulation of the neural circuitry involved in processing a particular stimulus array can be envisioned.</s><s>The first, and by far the most often reported, involves the selective enhancement of neural responsiveness or efficacy in those cells responsible for processing the particular stimulus upon which a subject's attention is focused, whether that stimulus is already present or merely anticipated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moran and Desimone, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Haenny and Schiller, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Corbetta et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Luck et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>The second variety of attentional modulation involves selective inhibition or disengagement of those neurons responsible for processing stimuli outside of the focus of attention, so that competing or distracting information is not or will not be processed fully (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moran and Desimone, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Motter, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Foxe et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Reynolds et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Vanduffel et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Worden et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>This would involve placing the neural circuitry normally responsible for processing such distracters in some "Sit in reverie, and watch the changing color of the waves that break upon the idle seashore of the mind."</s></p><p><s>-Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</s></p><p><s>The ability to selectively attend to a specific subset of one's sensory realm is at the root of human cognition and negotiation of one's environment.</s><s>The alternative, whereby all information in one's sensory domain is processed to the level of consciousness, does not allow for normal function and may be partially involved in certain neural disorders such as Autism spectrum disorders (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Markram and Markram, 2010)</ref> and attention deficit disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Armstrong et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>By necessity, successful task completion in daily life employs selective attention to one extent or another.</s><s>By inference, the ability to attend is assumed to be a "capacity-limited" system and to some degree, humans have executive or conscious control over what aspects of their environment are tapping this limited system from moment-to-moment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Broadbent, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kahneman, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Neely, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Schneider and Shiffrin, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Shiffrin and Schneider, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Schneider and Fisk, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>This endogenous form of attention is distinct from attention that is captured by salient stimuli in the environment in an involuntary fashion (exogenous attention).</s><s>How the brain achieves endogenous attentional selectivity has been a matter of vigorous research for some decades now.</s><s>Advances in neuroimaging technologies such as the hemodynamic functional imaging methodologies (fMRI and PET) and the ability to conduct high-Evidence has amassed from both animal intracranial recordings and human electrophysiology that neural oscillatory mechanisms play a critical role in a number of cognitive functions such as learning, memory, feature binding and sensory gating.</s><s>The wide availability of high-density electrical and magnetic recordings (64-256 channels) over the past two decades has allowed for renewed efforts in the characterization and localization of these rhythms.</s><s>A variety of cognitive effects that are associated with specific brain oscillations have been reported, which range in spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics depending on the context.</s><s>Our laboratory has focused on investigating the role of alpha-band oscillatory activity (8-14 Hz) as a potential attentional suppression mechanism, and this particular oscillatory attention mechanism will be the focus of the current review.</s><s>We discuss findings in the context of intersensory selective attention as well as intrasensory spatial and feature-based attention in the visual, auditory, and tactile domains.</s><s>The weight of evidence suggests that alpha-band oscillations can be actively invoked within cortical regions across multiple sensory systems, particularly when these regions are involved in processing irrelevant or distracting information.</s><s>That is, a central role for alpha seems to be as an attentional suppression mechanism when objects or features need to be specifically ignored or selected against.</s></p><p><s>mechanisms, anticipatory suppression, in a number of contexts: anticipatory suppression of one modality in favor of another <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Cuing Paradigm</head><p><s>In order to study the preparatory mechanisms of attentional biasing, we have employed the "cuing paradigm" to invoke endogenous biasing of the attentional system.</s><s>This is an effective experimental means of ensuring invocation of a high level of endogenous control by the use of symbolic cues that actively instruct the subject in an unpredictable manner to switch attention between tasks.</s><s>That is, a centrally presented cue such as an arrow, word, or sound is employed (stimulus 1 -S1), which informs of an upcoming task or indicates a specific location, modality, or feature for subsequent analysis (stimulus 2 -S2).</s><s>This manipulation is a nice experimental version of what is a fairly natural way of apportioning attention in our environment.</s><s>That is, humans spend a large part of their existence assigning attentive resources to their environment based on both external and internal instructional sets.</s><s>Such endogenous cuing paradigms can be classified into two basic categories: "probabilistic" and "instructional."</s><s>In a probabilistic cuing paradigm, participants are instructed to respond to all target S2's, including those that may occur at an uncued location.</s><s>Critically, the cue indicates the correct location of the target on a high proportion of trials, which encourages the participants to utilize the information provided by the cue.</s><s>The uncued location in this case cannot be considered a source of distracters, however, since participants still need to respond to targets there.</s><s>In contrast, an instructional cuing paradigm requires the participants to respond to targets occurring at the cued location only, and to ignore the uncued location completely.</s><s>In this way, the uncued location becomes simply a source of potentially distracting information, since stimuli occurring there will never warrant a response.</s><s>On the other hand, since no response is ever made to such distracters, a physiological measure is needed to evaluate the processing thereof.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>alPha-band effeCTs in inTersensory aTTenTion</head><p><s>Using an instructional endogenous cueing paradigm, we originally found differential modulation of parieto-occipital alphaband (8-14 Hz) oscillatory activity in the period preceding an imperative stimulus (S2) when visually presented word-cues (S1) instructed subjects in an intersensory attention paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Foxe et al., 1998</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In that experiment, subjects were cued to attend either the visual or auditory portion of a subsequent compound audio-visual stimulus, which occurred predictably 1.1 s after the cue.</s><s>We showed that the cue instruction to attend the auditory modality (the word "BEEP") resulted in significantly larger 8-14 Hz activity over parieto-occipital cortex in the anticipatory period preceding the S2 than when subjects were cued to attend the visual modality (the word "FLASH").</s><s>This effect was not due to eye closing or gaze issues as eye movements were carefully monitored and subjects were instructed to maintain fixation during both attend-auditory and attend-visual anticipatory periods.</s><s>We hypothesized that this oscillatory enhancement in the case of form of inhibited or decreased receptivity state.</s><s>Evidence from behavioral studies supports such a mechanism, as reaction times to stimuli presented at non-attended locations are slower relative to those at attended locations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Posner et al., 1980)</ref>, and precuing visual targets when they are presented with accompanying distracters improves performance to levels seen when no distracters were presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Morgan et al., 1998)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Some evidence suggests that one correlate of the first variety of attention, enhancement of neural processing for stimuli at the focus of attention, is the selective modulation of evoked gamma-band oscillatory activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Gruber et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Shibata et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Sokolov et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Fries et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>The evoked gamma-band response has been implicated as a neural mechanism for feature binding (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Singer, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Singer, , 1999))</ref>, and these studies have suggested that this binding function can be selectively invoked during attention tasks.</s><s>Attention effects in the gamma-band have typically been observed subsequent to stimulus onset.</s><s>A key aspect of endogenous attention, however, is the ability to prepare attentional resources in preparation for an expected stimulus prior to its onset.</s></p><p><s>One mechanism that has been suggested for the complementary, suppressive form of attention in the visual domain is the selective invocation of cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lopes da Silva, 1991)</ref>.</s><s>Since alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz) are known to be related to general alerting and ongoing visual processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adrian and Matthews, 1934;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Klimesch et al., 1998)</ref> and are seen in the EEG, even when subjects are involved in highly demanding tasks, we proposed that such oscillations may also be involved in selective attention mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Foxe et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>In support, the amplitudes of both the auditory and visual N1-P2 ERP components are modulated based on stimulus-preceding alpha amplitude (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Brandt and Jansen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brandt et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rahn and Bas¸ar, 1993a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brandt, 1997)</ref> with the caveat that in these studies, the reported effects could be mainly due to arousal issues.</s><s>More compellingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Vanni et al. (1997)</ref> demonstrated a parieto-occipital alpha effect such that alpha level became higher in the period following presentation of a "non-object" stimulus as opposed to meaningful objects.</s><s>They suggested that this represented a disengagement of attention by parietal attention gating structures in the inferior parietal region.</s><s>We predicted that such attentional disengagement might also be a facet of anticipatory attentional biasing mechanisms.</s><s>Our results regarding this prediction from a series of studies are discussed below.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>alPha and anTiCiPaTory gaTing of aTTenTion anTiCiPaTory biasing</head><p><s>In our laboratory, we have been particularly interested in detailing the top-down mechanisms by which the brain establishes biased attentional states -that is, anticipatory sets.</s><s>Until the past decade or so the vast majority of attention research had concentrated on the effects of attention on the processing of attended versus unattended stimuli that occurs subsequently, as a result of attentional biasing (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Desimone and Duncan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Hillyard and Anllo-Vento, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>When the brain is involved in attentionally demanding tasks, it is advantageous to direct attention to the relevant stimulus, location, or action that is to be engaged in, prior to the arrival of the stimulus or execution of the action.</s><s>We have reported a neural correlate of the second form of biasing <ref type="bibr">(1997)</ref>.</s><s>In such models, the posterior parietal areas of the fast dorsal visual stream mediate the extent of processing of a particular stimulus through parietal inputs to the thalamic relay nuclei, nucleus reticularis, and the putamen, and also through modulatory inputs to the ventral visual stream, which is specialized for the high level extraction of featural information from stimuli.</s><s>That is, the spatially specialized dorsal stream areas control the gateways to ventral visual processing.</s><s>How exactly this is achieved is currently a matter of debate.</s><s>We suggested that the enhanced parieto-occipital alphaband activity seen in our intersensory selective attention paradigm the attend-auditory instruction might reflect anticipatory gating of visual processing by parieto-occipital structures, which are known to be involved in attentional switching and disengagement within the visual modality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Posner et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Farah et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Posner and Petersen, 1990)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual feaTure-based aTTenTion</head><p><s>We also asked if this gating function of alpha-band activity was specific to spatial and intersensory attention, or rather if alpha could play a role in the biasing of attention between other stimulus parameters within a given modality, such as visual features <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Snyder and Foxe, 2010</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>It was well established from prior research that attention can be deployed to non-spatial visual features, such as color or motion parameters, facilitating the processing of subsequent stimuli incorporating the attended feature, independently of spatial location (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Corbetta et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wylie et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wylie et al., , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Most and Astur, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Egner et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>We again utilized an instructional cuing paradigm, although in this case the cues directed participants to attend to either the color or motion of an upcoming stimulus consisting of many small moving and colored dots.</s><s>Participants were tasked with making a difficult discrimination with respect to the cued feature.</s><s>We chose the features of color and motion because they have well-described, spatially separated cortical processing centers in the dorsal and ventral visual streams, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ungerleider and Mishkin, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>Using independent components analysis (ICA), we were able to isolate cortical sources that were highly dynamic in the alpha band during the preparatory cue-S2 interval, and some of these sources differentiated between attention to color and attention to motion.</s><s>Such sources located in putative dorsal stream regions showed increased power in the alpha band when motion was irrelevant, whereas sources located in ventral regions showed increased alpha power when color was irrelevant.</s><s>This pattern of results is analogous to the suppression effect observed with spatial attention, in which cortical areas responsible for processing irrelevant or distracting information show anticipatory increases in alpha band power.</s></p></div>

(2000)</ref>.</s><s>It should be mentioned, however, that the researchers examined only the interval during which the stimulus was actually presented, rather than the preparatory interval.</s><s>Additionally, a visual arrow cue was used, which has been shown to have strong exogenous effects on the allocation of visual attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ivanoff and Saoud, 2009)</ref>, admitting a potentially confounding factor.</s><s>In <ref type="bibr">Banerjee et al.

(2001)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, area IT revealed a strong positive correlation between alpha power and task performance.</s><s>The authors discussed the neural mechanisms of the attention sensitive alpha, it will fall largely to intracranial investigations in the awake behaving monkey to further resolve this puzzle.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ConClusion</head><p><s>We have described evidence for alpha-band oscillations as a mechanism for attentionally mediated selective suppression of distracting information.</s><s>Alpha-band power has been shown to increase over cortical areas responsible for processing potentially distracting information.</s><s>These attention-related sustained focal increases in alpha power occur prior to the arrival of an anticipated stimulus.</s><s>Such alpha-band effects have been observed across a variety of selective attention tasks, including intersensory attention, spatial attention in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory domains, and visual feature-based attention.</s><s>Beyond their robust occurrence during attention tasks, the state of alpha-band brain activity has been shown to predict visual cortical excitability and perceptual outcome.</s><s>Specifically, higher alpha power indicates lower cortical excitability and higher perceptual thresholds.</s><s>This is true for both naturally occurring and experimentally induced alpha-band activity in visual cortex.</s></p><p><s>We have also discussed the anatomical basis for alpha oscillations.</s><s>The strongest evidence from human TMS studies and monkey intracranial recordings indicates that attention-related alpha modulations are predominately under the control of a cortico-cortical network involving frontal and parietal regions, with a possible secondary influence from thalamo-cortical connections.</s><s>This is in contrast to arousal-related alpha, which is more likely thalamusdominated, and is potentially a functionally distinct mechanism from the alpha-band modulations observed in selective attention.</s><s>computed a cross power spectra between the thalamic recording and each of the two cortical recordings.</s><s>Linear least-square predictions allowed them to derive a partial coherence measure by eliminating the part of the two cortical signals that could be predicted by the thalamic signal.</s><s>Unfortunately, the use of a linear model does not in itself determine that cortico-cortical alpha can exist in isolation or that there is, as these authors claim, an independent component as it assumes that there is a linear relationship between the thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical components of alpha.</s><s>This may not be a reasonable assumption.</s><s>Nonetheless, it does at least show that the cortico-cortical part of the alpha process has added non-linear dynamics.</s><s>Of importance was an added finding that pulvinar was a much larger contributor to the cortical alpha coherence than was LGN, since pulvinar has been theorized to play an important role in selective attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Petersen et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robinson, 1993)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It seems plausible that while "arousal" alpha might have a large thalamic component, the alpha that is specifically modulated during selective attention tasks might rely more heavily on the corticocortical component of this system.</s><s>Closing the eyes disengages the visual system in the obvious way, and when straining to hear a faint sound we often close our eyes in order to concentrate effort on the task.</s><s>However, the alpha modulations reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Foxe et al. (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Worden et al. (2000)</ref>, and by many others since, were recorded during very difficult attentional tasks in which subjects were in a highly aroused state with their eyes open.</s><s>How the general alpha rhythm, known to all electrophysiologists and normally associated with arousal state of the subject and these very specific modulations of 8-14 Hz oscillatory activity recorded during selective attention paradigms are related will take more studies to elucidate.</s><s>As to</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FiGurE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FiGurE 1 | Adapted from Foxe et al.
