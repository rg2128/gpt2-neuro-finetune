<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main</head><p><s>The adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates many cellular functions including spreading, migration, proliferation, and differentiation, and thus plays a major role in embryonic development, adult tissue homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis 1 -3 .</s><s>Because the biophysical and biochemical properties of native ECMs are difficult to experimentally modulate, synthetic materials have been crucial towards isolating the contributions of specific matrix properties in regulating cell adhesion and function.</s><s>In particular, elastic hydrogel surfaces (e.g.</s><s>polyacrylamide gels) have proven indispensable in demonstrating that substrate stiffness or rigidity can itself modulate cell behavior 4 -6 , as these materials afford precise control of stiffness, independent of cell adhesive ligand density 7 .</s><s>However, it is unclear how findings on these smooth, flat surfaces extend to in vivo settings, where cells reside in or on complex three-dimensional (3D) ECMs consisting of meshworks of fibers with diameters typically on the order of micrometers 8 -10 .</s><s>These networks of fibers vary widely in density and organization depending on the tissue (e.g.</s><s>dense, aligned collagen bundles in tendon versus loose, less organized networks in glandular organs).</s><s>The micrometer-scale architecture of these fibrous networks constrains spatially where cells can form adhesions and imparts complex mechanical characteristics due to non-linear stiffening in response to loading and differential rigidity in axial versus transverse directions with respect to fiber orientation -all features that cannot be captured with existing isotropic, linear elastic hydrogel surfaces.</s><s>Given the lack of mechanically tunable synthetic materials possessing fibrous structure at physiologic length scales, an understanding of how cells sense and respond to the mechanics of fibrillar microenvironments remains an open challenge.</s><s>Here, we establish a novel material system that incorporates fibrillar structure while still maintaining synthetic control over mechanical and adhesive features and apply this system to elucidate mechanisms of how cells interpret ECM stiffness in fibrous networks.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fabrication of a synthetic fibrillar ECM with controllable architecture and mechanics</head><p><s>To develop a material system for studying fibrillar mechanosensing, we combined polymer chemistry, electrospinning, and soft lithography.</s><s>As a base material, we formulated a protein-resistant, methacrylated dextran (DexMA, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) 11 that could be functionalized with cell adhesive moieties following substrate fabrication (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Fiber networks with controllable architecture and mechanics were fabricated by electrospinning the polymer onto collection substrates such that fibers were suspended across microfabricated wells.</s><s>The geometry of the wells defined boundary conditions and elevated networks to exclude a mechanical contribution from the underlying rigid surface.</s><s>Numerous structural parameters were tuned in this system, including fiber diameter (via solution concentration, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>), fiber density (via fiber collection durations), and fiber anisotropy (via rotational speed of the collection surface) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Exposure to UV light crosslinked DexMA, rendering fibers insoluble and allowing stiffness to be modulated through the extent of light exposure.</s><s>To measure the mechanics of individual DexMA fibers as a function of UV exposure, we performed micro-scale threepoint bending tests using AFM (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) 12 , 13 .</s><s>The Young's modulus of individual fibers was tunable between 140 MPa and 10 GPa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), approximating the range of reported values for various fibrous biopolymers such as collagen (0.5-10 GPa) 12 , 14 .</s></p><p><s>As cells probe the mechanics of not just a single fiber, but a network composed of many fibers, a macroscale measurement of network mechanics was also developed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Increasing UV exposure to increase fiber modulus without altering other network parameters (Supplementary Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3,</ref><ref type="figure">9</ref>) led to an increase in network stiffness as expected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>A salient feature of the DexMA polymer is that in addition to fibrous networks, we can generate smooth hydrogel surfaces lacking fibrous topography from the same material to serve as a direct comparator in our studies.</s><s>Tuning mechanics by UV photocrosslinking yielded hydrogels with moduli between 450 Pa and 45 kPa as determined by AFM nanoindentation and Hertz contact mechanics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Upon processing DexMA into hydrogel or fibrillar form, the adhesive peptide CGRGDS (RGD) was coupled to substrates via Michael-type addition with unreacted methacrylates (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Although functionalization with other peptides or even full-length proteins is possible, we chose a non-fibrillar adhesion moiety to exclude the confounding mechanical contribution of a superimposed meshwork of ECM proteins, which has previously been shown to influence cellular mechanosensing 15 .</s><s>Thus, RGD coupled directly to DexMA fiber networks or hydrogel surfaces ensured that the ECM stiffness experienced by seeded cells was defined entirely by the structure of the material.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synthetic fiber networks recapitulate collagen matrices at multiple length scales</head><p><s>Several distinctions exist between this material and in vivo ECMs or even purified fibrous biopolymers such as type I collagen.</s><s>Structural features including persistence length, tortuosity, fiber diameter, and 3D organization likely diverge from natural fibrillar ECMs.</s><s>Biochemically, the exclusive use of RGD differs from the more complex ligand-receptor interactions mediating adhesion to native fibrillar proteins, such as the additional GFOGER and GVMGFO adhesion sequences on collagens or tension-induced exposure of cryptic binding sites in fibronectin <ref type="bibr">16 -19</ref> .</s><s>Given these disparities, we assessed how faithfully our synthetic fibrillar material recapitulated topographical and mechanical interactions between cells and a bona fide fibrous ECM.</s><s>For these studies, we chose type I collagen, the most abundant fibrillar protein in mammals and a well-studied model in mechanobiology over several decades 8 , 20 .</s><s>As a comparator possessing chemistry identical to fiber networks but lacking fibrous topography, cells were also cultured on the surface of DexMA hydrogels.</s></p><p><s>We began by examining cytoskeletal organization in cells cultured on these materials.</s><s>All studies presented here used human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), a model cell type for mechanosensing studies 6 , 15 , 21 , 22 , although similar trends were observed with human dermal mouse fibroblasts.</s><s>A high degree of similarity was observed between DexMA fiber networks and type I collagen matrices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>); cells in both conditions adopted a spindly morphology possessing thin, elongated processes that terminated in branched protrusions, with punctate vinculin-rich focal adhesions (FA) sequestered to the tips of these protrusions.</s><s>Centrally located FAs were not visible due to high cytosolic signal, and hMSCs possessed relatively few actin stress fibers traversing the cytoplasm, although actin was enriched at the hulls of processes.</s><s>This shift in vinculin from FAs to the cytosol and paucity of stress fibers has been suggested to be representative of cells in 3D matrices or in vivo tissues 20 , 23 -26 .</s><s>In contrast, cells seeded on stiff hydrogels adopted a well-spread, lamellar morphology with larger, elongated FAs distributed throughout the cell and numerous stress fibers similar to cells cultured on glass or plastic 24 .</s><s>Taken together, the surprising similarity between type I collagen matrices and fiber networks in contrast to flat hydrogel surfaces suggests that fibrillar topography had a stronger influence on cell morphology than the biochemical nature of these interactions.</s></p><p><s>Stopak and Harris demonstrated how cellular forces could physically reorganize ECM, culturing tissue explants within collagen matrices and observing the alignment of fibers in fields of high tension that directed cell migration between adjacent explants 27 .</s><s>To test whether DexMA fiber networks could capture this phenomenon, multicellular hMSCs spheroids were seeded on the synthetic fiber networks.</s><s>Indeed, cell forces pulled fibers into alignment and cells began to directionally migrate towards adjacent spheroids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), mimicking the response on collagen matrices.</s><s>This response did not occur on DexMA hydrogels of a range of different stiffnesses, highlighting the comparatively limited range of deformations in non-fibrous materials 28 .</s><s>These results reinforce a high degree of mechanical similarity between our synthetic fibrillar ECM and collagen, and provide evidence of the potential for ECM remodeling and long range force transmission in this material 29 , 30 , a process relevant to, for example, cancer cell escape from primary tumors during metastasis 31 .</s></p><p><s>In addition to local remodeling, macroscale contraction has been observed in fibroblastpopulated collagen matrices and used to assess how tensile forces generated by cells elicit morphogenetic changes 32 -34 .</s><s>When we seeded DexMA fiber networks unattached to any boundary constraints, compaction occurred over a three day time course, comparable to collagen (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), whereas seeded DexMA hydrogels of a range of stiffnesses and unseeded DexMA fiber samples did not change in diameter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Altering the concentration of collagen can tune the contraction response over a limited range, but such perturbation simultaneously alters fibril and adhesive ligand density as well as mechanics.</s><s>Importantly, in contrast to biologic ECMs, we can independently tune fiber stiffness, density, and architecture to dictate the ability of cells to deform the material.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increasing fiber stiffness suppresses cell spreading and proliferation</head><p><s>Having validated our synthetic material, we next tested whether cells respond to an increase in material stiffness in fiber networks in similar fashion to hydrogel surfaces.</s><s>To assay a cell response thoroughly described in the literature, we first examined the relationship between material stiffness and cell spreading.</s><s>Tuning DexMA crosslinking to define soft (290 Pa) and stiff (19.1 kPa) hydrogels, we confirmed previous observations 4 -6 , 35 : at low stiffness cells failed to spread; with increasing stiffness, spreading and the formation of large lamellae occurred (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref>).</s><s>To examine a longer term, functional outcome, we measured cell proliferation over a two day time course.</s><s>In these experiments, we observed uniformly low cell death across all conditions, suggesting cytocompatibility and no direct effects of stiffness on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>With stiffness-induced increases in cell area from soft to stiff hydrogels, we observed a commensurate increase in cell proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>), again in line with numerous previous reports 35 -37 .</s><s>Surprisingly, when cells were cultured on soft (fiber: 140 MPa, network: 2.8 kPa) and stiff (fiber: 3.1 GPa, network: 55 kPa) fiber networks with all other parameters maintained constant, cell area did not increase with fiber stiffness as observed on hydrogel surfaces, but instead showed a modest but significant decrease (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, in stark contrast to hydrogel surfaces, cell proliferation in soft networks was three-fold higher than in stiff networks fabricated at the same fiber density (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We then examined whether this inverted proliferation response occurs in an established fibrillar setting and excluded an RGD-specific response by repeating the experiment with collagen matrices, in which stiffness and ligand density were simultaneously modulated by altering collagen concentration.</s><s>Although increasing either stiffness or ligand density alone increases cell area and proliferation on synthetic hydrogels 7 , 35 -38 , we found that the soft, low concentration collagen matrices promoted proliferation compared to the stiffer, high concentration matrices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-d</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these data suggest that in fibrous ECMs, the relationship between substratum stiffness and cell function is inverted as compared to on hydrogel surfaces.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fiber recruitment by cells increases local adhesive ligand density, apparent stiffness, and adhesion signaling</head><p><s>Modulating fiber stiffness had a significant effect on the ability of cells to reorganize fibers.</s></p><p><s>In soft networks, cells pulled and deformed the networks, resulting in significant recruitment of fibers to the cell and the formation of numerous densely compacted clusters of fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, Supplementary Video 3).</s><s>Conversely, stiff networks presented a rigid and essentially immobile ECM that underwent negligible architectural remodeling.</s><s>The range of deformations in soft networks is illustrated by the displacement of fluorescent microspheres embedded within soft DexMA fibers upon cell attachment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>), and qualitatively by movies of cells migrating on soft versus stiff fibers (Supplementary Video 1 &amp; 2).</s><s>Microsphere (and fiber) motion was unidirectional and displacements were high in soft networks (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, Supplementary Videos 4 &amp; 5).</s><s>In contrast, displacements in soft hydrogels were an order of magnitude smaller and underwent cyclic motions, suggestive of "load-and-fail" dynamics described previously by Chan et al 39 .</s></p><p><s>The considerable physical reorganization and clustering of fibers in soft networks resulted in increased adhesive ligand density adjacent to the cell.</s><s>Time lapse confocal imaging of fiber networks functionalized with fluorescently tagged RGD demonstrated a rapid 2-3 fold increase of local RGD density following cell attachment to soft networks, with little change in stiff networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c-d</ref>, Supplementary Video 3).</s><s>Consistent with the conclusion that increased matrix contact with cells due to fiber recruitment provides the mechanism for enhanced response, we observed that differences in proliferation between soft and stiff fibers decreased and ultimately were eliminated by increasing the initial fiber density of the network (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, we also observed decreased fiber recruitment with increasing fiber density, likely due to the distribution of cellular contractile work across more adhesion -a phenomenon that has previously been described 40 -</s></p><p><s>deforming each fiber to a lesser degree.</s></p><p><s>Increases in ligand density could enhance FA assembly 38 , 41 .</s><s>Indeed, soft networks were found to promote FA formation (vinculin localization) over stiff networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>), even when restricting analysis to cells with similar spread areas (as spreading is correlated with enhanced FA formation 4 , 42 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>While in both conditions FAs localized to the tips of extended cell processes, hMSCs on soft networks possessed markedly more centrally located FAs, directly localized to underlying clustered fibers.</s><s>Average FA size, number of FAs, and total FA area were all higher in cells on soft fiber networks, and consistently inverted as compared to the response to stiffness on hydrogel surfaces (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a, d-f</ref>).</s><s>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays a central role in transducing adhesion into biochemical signals 43 , and markedly more phosphorylated FAK was detected at FA sites in soft fiber networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5g-h</ref>).</s><s>This increased FAK activation was functionally important to the proliferation induced on soft networks, as inhibition of FAK with a selective inhibitor (PF-573228 44 ) abrogated the increase in proliferation on soft networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>While these studies implicate an important role for fiber recruitment in the cellular response to fibrous matrices, one alternative explanation for the results is that decreasing fiber stiffness also alters the nanoscale mobility or mechanics of RGD on soft fibers, thereby impacting integrin clustering or catch-bond dynamics 15 , 39 , 45 , 46 .</s><s>To distinguish fiber recruitment from the effects of RGD mobility or mechanics, we modulated the interconnections or "welding" between fibers as a means to reduce fiber recruitment without altering the stiffness or RGD mobility of individual fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5j</ref>).</s><s>In standard networks, fiber intersections were a mixture of welded and unwelded states (Supplemental Video 6, 8).</s></p><p><s>To maximize fiber-fiber welding, networks were placed in a controlled humidity environment and provided sufficient moisture prior to light exposure to fuse all juxtaposed fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5j</ref>, Supplementary Videos 7).</s><s>Indeed, this welding resulted in reduced fiber clustering compared to soft networks, though not to the extent of stiff networks, and resulted in intermediate levels of fiber/RGD recruitment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5k</ref>).</s><s>Cell proliferation in these soft welded networks was likewise intermediate between soft and stiff networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5l</ref>), supporting the model that fiber recruitment (and not the stiffness of individual fibers per se)</s></p><p><s>is the primary mechanism of mechanotransduction observed in these studies.</s></p><p><s>Here, we describe a new biomaterial system that recapitulates the fibrous architecture of native ECMs while providing the control offered by synthetic materials.</s><s>Using this material, we uncovered a previously unrecognized mechanism for transducing matrix stiffness, whereby lower fiber/network stiffness enabled cells to recruit nearby fibers, leading to increased local adhesive ligand density, enhanced adhesion signaling, cell spreading, and proliferative signaling.</s><s>Notably, we find that multiple structural parameters of fiber networks (ie.</s><s>fiber stiffness, fiber-fiber welding, and fiber density) converge through cellular fiber recruitment to influence cell function.</s><s>This link between fiber recruitment and proliferation suggests that spatial rearrangements of ECM are not merely a consequence of cellular forces, but can also feedback to alter cell signaling and function 31 .</s><s>Moreover, given that these dramatic structural rearrangements are absent in traditional elastic hydrogel materials, these findings highlight the need for novel materials that can more accurately capture the mechanical behavior of native ECMs.</s><s>Recent work identifying a role for substrate stressrelaxation in cell spreading through the introduction of viscoelasticity to gels further illustrates this need 47 .</s><s>Future innovation to incorporate such properties in addition to dynamic features (ie.</s><s>cell-mediated matrix degradation, synthesis, and crosslinking) into fibrous materials will be critical in further refining our understanding of the feedback between matrix structure/mechanics and the cellular response.</s></p><p><s>Most tissues possess bulk moduli in the Pa to kPa range, while the protein fibers that compose these tissues are often in the MPa to GPa range 48 , 49 .</s><s>Our ability to not only recapitulate these features in our synthetic fiber networks, but also independently tune mechanics at different length scales may provide a path to elucidating how cells assimilate mechanic signals from multiple length scales (eg.</s><s>through integrin clustering and focal adhesion assembly at the nanoscale 21 , 50 and through actomyosin activity between focal adhesions to probe

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synthesis of methacrylated dextran (DexMA)</head><p><s>Dextran (MP Biomedicals, MW 86,000 kDa) was methacrylated by reaction with glycidyl methacrylate, according to a modified, previously described procedure 11</s></p><p><s>. In brief, dextran (20 g) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (2 g) were dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (100 mL) under vigorous stirring.</s><s>Glycidyl methacrylate (24.6 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 45 °C for 24 h.</s><s>The solution was cooled on ice for 20 min and precipitated into 1 L ice cold 2-isopropanol.</s><s>The crude product was recovered by centrifugation, redissolved in milli-Q water and dialyzed against milli-Q water for 3 days.</s><s>The final product was lyophilized and stored at -20 °C until use.</s><s>DexMA was characterized by 1 H-NMR (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The degree of functionalization was calculated as the ratio of the averaged methacrylate proton integral (6.174 ppm and 5.713 ppm in D 2 O) and the anomeric proton of the glycopyranosyl ring (5.166 ppm and 4.923 ppm).</s><s>Since the signal of the anomeric proton of α-1,3 linkages (5.166 ppm) partially overlaps with other protons, a pre-determined ratio 11 of 4% α-1,3 linkages was assumed and the total anomeric proton integral was calculated solely based on the integral at 4.923 ppm.</s><s>A methacrylate:dextran repeat unit ratio of 0.7 was determined.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DexMA fiber network fabrication</head><p><s>3D networks of suspended DexMA fibers were fabricated by a combination of electrospinning and standard soft photolithography.</s><s>DexMA was dissolved at 0.3-0.6 g/mL in a 1:1 mixture of milli-Q water and dimethylformamide with 0.005% Irgacure 2959 photoinitiator (Ciba, Tarrytown, NY).</s><s>Electrospinning was accomplished with a custom setup consisting of a high voltage power supply (Gamma High Voltage Research, Ormond Beach, FL), syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA), and grounded copper or aluminum collecting surface enclosed within an environmental chamber (Terra Universal, Fullerton, CA).</s><s>Electrospinning was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/h, voltage of 7.5 kV, and gap distance of 8 cm (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11 a-b</ref>).</s><s>To induce a preferred direction of fiber alignment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the static grounded surface (6×6×1/8 inch copper sheet) was replaced with a motorized platen rotating at 1200 rpm, a speed sufficient to translate the substrate at a linear velocity of 10 m/s (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11 c-d</ref>).</s><s>Samples were primary crosslinked under UV to stabilize fibers, hydrated in a solution containing 1 mg/mL Irgacure 2959, and then exposed to varying durations of UV (100 mW/cm 2 ) to control the degree of crosslinking and resulting stiffness.</s><s>Fibers were collected on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS; Sylgard 184, Dow-Corning, Midland, MI) arrays of circular wells (2 mm diameter) functionalized with methacrylates to promote fiber adhesion.</s><s>Briefly, silicon wafer masters possessing SU-8 photoresist (Microchem, Westborough, MA) were produced by standard photolithography and used to generate PDMS stamps.</s><s>Following silanization with trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane, stamps were used to emboss uncured PDMS onto oxygen plasma-treated coverslips.</s><s>Well arrays were methacrylated with a 2% v/v solution of 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate in ethanol for at least 24 h.</s><s>To promote fiber-fiber welding, fiber networks were briefly exposed to a humidified environment (60% relative humidity, determined empirically) prior to primary crosslinking.</s><s>This approach to fuse fibers at overlaying intersection points was predicated on previous work showing the influence of solvent volatility on fiber-fiber welding 57 .</s><s>Lateral displacements using a diamond dissecting knife (Type MDL, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) controlled by a micromanipulator (HCU-3DM, SmarAct GMBH, Oldenburg, Germany) were applied to networks to confirm the introduction of fiber-fiber welding.</s></p></div>
