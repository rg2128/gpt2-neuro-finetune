see Methods for details).</s><s>Given that the stimulus change is brief and the following reaction time window is also short, the task is challenging, with the animals' performance well above chance, but far from saturated (mean ± SEM = 87% ± 1% for monkey M; 87% ± 2% for monkey F).</s><s>This paradigm allowed us to compare the responses of each neuron (and its encoding accuracy) to an attended vs an unattended direction change.</s></p><p><s>To visualize the results, we consider our data set as representative for the population of MT neurons responding to a given motion stimulus and its change.</s><s>Given this assumption we determined the temporal evolution of the activity profile of the MT population throughout the trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-e</ref>; see Methods for details).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>-c depicts the MT population response to an attended (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) and an unattended (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) stimulus.</s><s>As expected, both profiles show a shift in the activity peak following the direction changes of the stimulus in the RF.</s><s>In similar agreement with the known attentional gain modulation of visual responses in extrastriate cortex, the MT responses are enhanced for the attended vs. the unattended stimulus inside the RF.</s><s>However, surprisingly, even just a visual inspection of the profiles (see zoomed-in panels Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d-e</ref>; black line represents the encoded stimulus direction; white line represents the physical stimulus) reveals an overrepresentation of the stimulus direction after the initial stimulus change, which is more pronounced when the stimulus is attended.</s></p><p><s>To quantify the effect of attention on the accuracy of the encoded direction change, we averaged the pre-and post-change population responses from -700 to 0 ms (pre-change) and from 100 to 200 ms (post-change) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Pre-and post-change responses to the attended stimulus show a multiplicative attentional enhancement of about 13% compared to the responses to the unattended stimulus (Supplementary Note 2).</s><s>Most importantly, and in line with the visual inspection of the time courses in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>-e, the physical direction change of 25°is represented in the post-change population response as a 39°c hange, an overestimation of 14°.</s><s>Evaluation of the encoding accuracy of an unattended stimulus shows a similar but markedly smaller misrepresentation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>), most likely reflecting the effects of sensory adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>The comparison of the attended and unattended representation shows that attention enhances, rather than reduces, a perceptual inaccuracy present in the neural representation of the magnitude of unattended stimulus changes.</s></p><p><s>As a further quantification of our observations we separately determined pre-and post-change direction tuning curves for each cell by fitting its responses (averaged across the same time windows used above) with von Mises functions (see Methods for details; see Supplementary Note 3 for direction tuning curves of an example MT cell as well as fit quality and direction selectivity distributions for the cells).</s><s>The distributions of the individual cell's preferred direction shift in both attentional conditions confirm our previous analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>The median shift for an attended stimulus is -14°(p = 0.0005, two-sided Wilcoxon's signed-rank test for distribution with zero median), whereas it is -6°(p = 0.0000005, two-sided Wilcoxon's signed-rank test for distribution with zero median) for an unattended stimulus (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>The difference between tuning shifts in attended and unattended conditions is highly significant (p = 0.001, paired two-sided Wilcoxon's signed-rank test).</s><s>Our results remained consistent when parsed by the data collected from each animal individually (Supplementary Note 4).</s></p><p><s>In a series of analyses, we confirmed that our results are independent of the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used to calculate the spike density function (SDF), the tuning characteristics of neurons, the position of the pre-and postchange spike count windows, and the symmetry of the function used to fit the tuning data (Supplementary Note 5).</s></p><p><s>We also employed a simple linking model to translate the shift of the direction tuning of MT cells induced by the attended and unattended direction changes into an estimate of the perceived abrupt direction change.</s><s>According to a labeled-line model, each possible direction is encoded by one neuron (or neuronal subpopulation).</s><s>Each neuron's "label" is its pre-change preferred direction and the population response profile is the distribution of responses across all neurons to a given stimulus (Supplementary Note 6).</s><s>Based on a winner-take-all readout approach, the perceived (readout) direction is the preferred direction (label) of the neuron with the largest evoked response to the stimulus, i.e., the location of the peak of the population response profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>This simple model predicts that direction tuning shifts induced by the attended and unattended abrupt direction changes result in the overestimation of the perceived direction change with the magnitudes we saw in the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref> (Supplementary Note 6).</s></p><p><s>Perceptual representation of attended change events.</s><s>Given the central and causal role of area MT for visual motion perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , we wondered whether the perceptual representation of the abrupt direction change also follows its neural representation.</s><s>To test this, we examined the perception of attended direction changes in human subjects using a design similar to the one of our monkey electrophysiology study (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>Human subjects were instructed to maintain their gaze on a central fixation spot on a computer display.</s><s>On a given trial, two RDPs moving in the same direction (rightward or leftward, with some deviation off the horizontal) were presented to the left and right of the fixation spot and subjects were instructed to attend to the right RDP.</s><s>At a random time point the direction of the attended RDP changed by 22°, 25°, or 27°towards the horizontal (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>).</s><s>Using a staircase approach, we adjusted the prechange direction such that the perceived post-change direction was aligned with the horizontal direction (see Methods for details).</s><s>This counterbalanced design allowed us to estimate the subject's perception of the magnitude of the attended direction change, unbiased by known issues, such as direction repulsion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>It is notewothy that it was not our intention to isolate the effect of attention on the perception of behaviorally relevant direction changes.</s><s>Rather, we aimed to demonstrate that (assuming a similar neural misrepresentation in humans and our monkeys) humans experience a perceptual overestimation of the magnitude of attended direction changes.</s></p><p><s>We found that all but one subject overestimated the postchange direction (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>), with an average overestimation of 6°.</s><s>Although the magnitude of the effect is smaller than the overrepresentation in MT, it is highly significant (p = 0.004, two-sided Wilcoxon's signed-rank test for distribution with zero median), supporting the hypothesis that the misrepresentation we observed in MT is the neural basis for the perceptual overestimation in our human subjects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The visual system of primates operates in a predominantly stable, steady-state sensory environment.</s><s>Correspondingly, changes in the sensory input are highly informative and the visual system has evolved to be particularly sensitive to these signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Here we investigated how attention impacts the neural representation of such change events.</s><s>This offers an opportunity to dissociate two potentially conflicting core conceptual aims of attentional systems: the improvement of perception by an enhanced dominance and accuracy of attended stimulus representations vs. the improvement of behavioral performance by a magnification of task-relevant sensory aspects, even if that entails creating a "less veridical" stimulus representation.</s></p><p><s>The model system for our study was the neural basis of the effects of attention on the perception of abrupt changes in the direction of a moving stimulus.</s><s>We determined putative population responses to such changes from single-cell recordings in extrastriate area MT of two rhesus monkeys performing a motion direction change detection task.</s><s>Area MT is known to play a critical role in the perception of visual motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and it contains a large proportion of direction-selective cells whose responses are modulated by attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Our results show that a behaviorally relevant change in the direction of motion induces a shift in the center of MT population response that is more than 50% larger than predicted by the physical change in the stimulus.</s><s>The psychophysical results of our direction discrimination experiment in human complement the physiological effects by demonstrating a similar perceptual overestimation of direction changes.</s><s>These results strongly argue for a role of attention in overrepresenting sensory changes in our environment, particularly if the change per se is behaviorally relevant.</s><s>It is noteworthy that our human psychophysical experiment, while invoking attention, does not distinguish between the effects of attention and adaptation.</s></p><p><s>One contributor to the overestimated neural representation of the direction change might be changes in the tuning of MT neurons after motion adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>This could explain the shifts in the population response to an irrelevant stimulus, found in our unattended condition (sensory shifts).</s><s>However, in our attended condition the overrepresentation was much larger, despite identical sensory stimulation.</s><s>Could an increased adaptation, caused by the attentional increase of responses cause this effect?</s><s>Our data argue against this.</s><s>If the increase in the tuning shifts associated with attention (attentional shifts, attended shift-unattended shift) is caused by the attentional modulation of pre-change responses, we would expect that neurons with larger attentional modulation of their responses exhibit larger attentional shifts.</s><s>Instead, we found that there is no correlation between the attentional modulation of pre-change tuning parameters and the attentional shifts (Pearson's correlation: r &lt; 0.2, p &gt; 0.05).</s><s>To further investigate the interaction between attention and pre-change visual motion adaptation, we examined the relationship between the decay of responses over the course of visual motion exposure prior to the direction change as a measure of adaptation and the attentional shift and did not find any correlation between them (Pearson's correlation: r = 0.04, p = 0.8; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, if attention increases the adaptation-induced tuning shifts simply by modulating the pre-change responses, we would expect that the cells with larger negative sensory shifts in unattended condition (which presumably underwent stronger adaptation over the course of pre-change visual motion exposure) exhibit larger negative attentional shifts.</s><s>In other words, there should be a positive correlation between a shift in the sensory (unattended) condition and the attentional shift.</s><s>Our analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>) shows an opposite relationship (negative correlation, Pearson's r = -0.81,</s><s>p = 2 × 10 -13 ): cells with large negative tuning shifts in unattended condition were those either not affected by attention, or even showed positive attentional shifts (opposite to the sign of main effect) and vice versa (i.e., the cells with positive sensory shifts had the largest negative attentional shifts).</s><s>This suggests that attention does not increase the sensory shifts simply by modulating the pre-change responses, but rather combines with the effect of adaptation to improve the neural representation of the change event.</s><s>All together, these results demonstrate that while adaptation might cause the misrepresentation in the unattended condition, the larger effects in the attended condition are not the direct results of an attentionally enhanced adaptation, but rather reflect attention, like adaptation, causes an overrepresentation of motion change.</s><s>Similarly, psychophysical studies in human subjects demonstrate that adaptation does not modulate the magnitude of attentional effects on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Normalization mechanisms have been used to explain the effects of adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , and they offer a plausible explanation for our electrophysiological findings.</s><s>These mechanisms assume that visual motion exposure not only suppresses the feedforward drive of neurons but also weakens the activity of the neurons that make up the normalization pools, resulting in a decrease in the suppressive drive and therefore response facilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>A normalization model that incorporates both adaptation and attention might be able to account for the effects induced by unattended and attended direction changes.</s><s>Based on this model, direction change overestimation in MT results from the suppression of the feedforward drive as well as a weakened normalization following the visual motion exposure.</s><s>Attention might increase the overestimation by modulating both components.</s></p><p><s>A human psychophysics study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> has shown that an attentional enhancement of spatial resolution leads to an enhanced perpetual performance for peripheral vision, but a reduced performance at central retinal locations.</s><s>Our study complements this rare example of an attentional modulation that reduced accurate representation of stimulus.</s><s>We showed a reduced neural and perceptual accuracy in motion directions after abrupt direction changes.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, recent studies have used a signal detection approach to show that attention increases the sensitivity of neurons in primate prefrontal cortex to discriminate between the neural representations of two stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> .</s><s>Our results extend this finding: we observe an enhanced separation between the responses of a whole population of MT neurons to a stimulus before and after a given direction change, increasing this signalto-noise relationship, supporting an enhanced sensitivity for the change.</s></p><p><s>To summarize, we show that, in a motion direction change detection task, attention distorts the neural representation of the change, increasing its perceptual detectability, but causing a misperception of the direction change magnitude.</s><s>In other words, our study dissociates the widely documented attentional improvements of perception from attentional improvements of behavioral performance by showing that under appropriate circumstances visual attention mechanisms enhance the perceptual saliency of abrupt changes in sensory signals at the expense of an accurate representation of the physical change.</s><s>This appears to be a highly adaptive and dynamic feature of an attentional system to produce neural representations of sensory events that optimize behavioral outcomes.</s></p></div>
