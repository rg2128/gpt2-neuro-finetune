been viewed differently.</s><s>Mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs), the two principal types of neurons of the olfactory bulb, have been thought to play identical roles in odor coding despite clear anatomical differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mori et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Orona et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Igarashi et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Recently, however, multiple studies have iden-tified functional differences between MCs and TCs that suggest that the olfactory system segregates olfactory information into parallel pathways, much like other sensory systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fukunaga et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Igarashi et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, MCs and TCs are modulated differentially by the raphe nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kapoor et al., 2016)</ref> and the piriform cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Otazu et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, compared with MCs, TCs are less frequently inhibited by odors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nagayama et al., 2004)</ref>, respond to lower concentration odors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Igarashi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kikuta et al., 2013)</ref>, and have responses that are more highly correlated to olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) input <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adam et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recent work has also explored differences in how the latency of odor-evoked responses differs between MCs and TCs because response latency has the potential to encode behaviorally relevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cury and Uchida, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Shusterman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Smear et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>TCs respond to odors hundreds of milliseconds earlier in the sniff cycle and show more concentrationinvariant odor-evoked response latencies than MCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fukunaga et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Igarashi et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>These data suggest that MCs may use spike latency to encode concentration-specific information, whereas TCs may encode concentration-independent information.</s></p><p><s>In light of these emerging differences in response latency, determining the circuit-level mechanisms that drive these differences is critical.</s><s>Compared with MCs, TCs are more intrinsically excitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burton and Urban, 2014)</ref> and receive stronger OSN input <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gire et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burton and Urban, 2014)</ref>, suggesting that a combination of intrinsic and synaptic differences drive differential responses to changes in concentration.</s><s>Little is known about whether differences in inhibition between MCs and TCs contribute to differences in odor-evoked responses.</s><s>OSN stimulation evokes strong inhibition originating from both the glomerular layer and the granule cell (GC) layer onto MCs and TCs.</s><s>However, the relative influence of glomerular layer circuits versus GCs in shaping odor-evoked activity in MCs and TCs remains unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cleland, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fukunaga et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gschwend et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Multiple GABAergic interneuron subtypes reside in the glomerular layer, including periglomerular cells (PGCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kiyokage et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Shao et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Najac et al., 2015)</ref>, superficial short-axon cells (sSACs) <ref type="bibr"

(ETCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Tatti et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, whether differences in the strength of these glomerular layer circuits contribute to differences in the latency of MC and TC responses remains unknown.</s><s>Computational models predict that differential input from PGCs may drive differences in spike latency between MCs and TCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fukunaga et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, other work has shown that the strengths of PGC-mediated inhibitory currents onto MCs and TC are similar when OSNs are stimulated at weak intensities <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Najac et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, a systematic investigation of how both GC-and glomerular-layer-mediated inhibitory currents onto MCs and TCs vary with stimulus intensity is needed.</s></p><p><s>Here, using whole-cell recordings in acute olfactory bulb slices, we find that MCs display longer-latency spiking that is more strongly dependent on stimulus intensity than TCs.</s><s>We find that longer-latency spiking in MCs is a consequence of weaker excitatory and stronger inhibitory currents onto MCs compared with TCs.</s><s>Stronger inhibitory currents onto MCs than TCs originate in the glomerular layer, so blocking glomerular layer inhibition, but not GC-mediated, inhibition led to more reliable and shorter-latency responses in MCs, but not TCs.</s><s>These data suggest that differences in odor-evoked response latency between MCs and TCs are due in part to differences in glomerular-layer-mediated inhibition.</s></p></div>
