Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>Based on our findings here and a previous imaging study from our lab showing that mAChR activation in the OB leads to increased odor responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , we further hypothesized that blocking mAChR activation would prevent any contextual change driven olfactory dishabituation.</s><s>Mice (n = 10) were implanted with bilateral OB cannula and received infusions of the mAChR antagonist scopolamine (1 mM) prior to one trial and infusions of vehicle (Ringer's solution) prior to another.</s><s>Mice were counter balanced so that half received vehicle first and the other half received scopolamine first.</s><s>No effect of treatment was found when comparing investigation duration at key time points (minutes 0, 1, and 6) in the habituation paradigm (two-way RM ANOVA: F(1,18) = 1.86, p = 0.19).</s><s>Further, both scopolamine-and vehicle-treated mice displayed similar habituation rates with investigation times first becoming significantly different than the initial minute by minute three.</s></p><p><s>Following vehicle infusion, investigation behavior increased with odor (ethyl valerate) onset and decreased throughout the odor presentation (RM ANOVA: F(9,81) = 10.71,</s><s>p = 0.0001; minute 0 = 9.55 ± 1.14 s, 1 = 29.37 ± 2.38 s, and 6 = 11.34 ± 1.90 s).</s><s>Similar to the optogenetic ACh stimulation, changing the visual context in the seventh minute of the odor presentation significantly increased investigation behavior for the next three minutes (minute 6 = 11.34 ± 1.90 s, 7 = 18.75 ± 2.39 s, and 9 = 13.21 ± 2.43 s; Fig. <ref type="figure">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>When the same mice were treated with OB scopolamine, investigation still significantly increased with the initial odor presentation and decreased by minute 6 (RM ANOVA: F(9,81) = 14.26, p = 0.0001; minute 0 = 8.96 ± 0.96 s, 1 = 24.19 ± 2.09 s, and 6 = 9.36 ± 1.94 s), but the visual stimulation-mediated increase in odor investigation was completely blocked (minute 6 = 9.36 ± 1.94 s, 7 = 6.87 ± 1.19 s, and 9 = 11.14 ± 1.50 s;

investigation was dishabituated by 25 and 50 Hz OLS.</s><s>Comparing these two higherfrequency stimulations revealed a frequency dependence of the duration of the dishabituating effect.</s><s>However, in both cases, in the minute following the stimulation, the amount of dishabituated odor investigation was not significantly different than the amount of initial odor investigation, possibly indicating that if a salient odor is detected, a stereotypical amount of time will be spent investigating that odor, unaffected by the intensity of the stimulation.</s><s>In our paradigm, 5 Hz OLS had no effect on odor investigation.</s><s>A study in awake rats found BF firing rates during baseline conditions to be approximately 10 Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>In the context of these results, our 5 Hz stimulation may be below resting BF firing rates and does not drive cholinergic release above baseline conditions.</s></p><p><s>These experiments effectively demonstrated that artificially increasing OB ACh can reinstate habituated odor responses and odor investigation, but it was still unclear whether this cholinergic effect in the OB was ecologically valid.</s><s>Multiple studies have shown that hippocampal and cortical ACh levels rapidly rise in response to various novel sensory stimuli, including contextual changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Based on this, we performed the behavioral habituation experiment in another group of mice, but instead of driving ACh release optogenetically, we used a more naturalistic paradigm in which the visual context of the chamber was suddenly changed.</s><s>Visual stimulation increased odor investigation.</s><s>The effect was not as strong as it was with OLS, however the ACh change that occurs in the OB during the VS is unknown and could be less intense than that driven by OLS.</s><s>Alternatively, attention could have been divided between exploring the new visual environment and the reinstated odor.</s><s>The dishabituating effect of the visual context change was blocked by OB administration of scopolamine, a mAChR antagonist while having no effect on habituation rates themselves.</s><s>These findings support prior studies demonstrating OB muscarinic activity has little effect on habituation itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>As our initial imaging experiments were on a shorter timescale and in anesthetized mice, it was potentially difficult to directly compare our imaging findings those seen in the behavioral experiments.</s><s>To address this, we imaged glomerular responses to either 30 s or 7 min odor presentations in awake head-fixed mice.</s><s>In both cases, responses displayed similar habituation and dishabituation following visual context change, suggesting glomerular habituation/dishabituation mechanisms are similar at either timescale.</s></p><p><s>Although we did not address the mechanism underlying these effects in this study, they are potentially mediated through muscarinic type 2 receptors located on interneurons within the glomerular layer and external plexiform layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>A subset of these, juxtaglomerular interneurons, tonically inhibit OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>This tonic inhibition reduces the gain of OSN excitatory drive onto M/T cells.</s><s>Following unexpected changes in the environment, we hypothesize that OB ACh release decreases this presynaptic inhibition, increasing the strength of OSN input and enhancing M/T cell responses.</s><s>In order for an activity-dependent mAChR effect to play a role in our longer-lasting behavioral experiments, input would still have to be coming into the OB from the periphery.</s><s>Prolonged activity was demonstrated by an fMRI study showing that activity in the olfactory nerve and glomerular layers is reduced, but present even after 10 min of odor presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, none of our cholinergic manipulations were effective at reinstating investigation unless odor was present.</s></p><p><s>Our experiments showed that ACh can quickly alter glomerular odor responses and shift habituated animals into active investigatory behavior.</s><s>The BF cholinergic system has been thought to act slowly and globally within the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>However, more recently it has been shown that fast, local ACh release in specific cortical regions can have a major impact on sensory processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and signal detection 47 on a timescale of seconds.</s><s>Signal detection studies suggest that phasic cholinergic signaling can arise from local excitation of cholinergic terminals within the cortex, independent of direct BF activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> .</s><s>However, given that our behavioral dishabituation effect can be mediated via novel non-olfactory sensory cues, it is likely that the rapid cholinergic dishabituation we observe in the OB is driven by excitatory afferent input into the BF from other brain regions involved in sensory processing or novelty detection.</s><s>While our effects appear to be localized to the OB, the BF also projects to several other olfactory areas and its activation in these circumstances could certainly affect odor processing as well.</s></p><p><s>While the BF receives input from many brain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> , the locus coeruleus (LC) stands out as a region of interest for future studies.</s><s>The LC projects noradrenergic fibers to the BF <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and can excite BF cholinergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s><s>LC neurons are activated by novel objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> and sensory stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> , such as light flashes, and have been hypothesized to drive arousalinduced attentional processing through BF circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, the only other report of olfactory dishabituation in the literature involves a noradrenergic mechanism within the piriform cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>It is possible that the dishabituating cholinergic effects we observe represent an additional pathway by which the LC mediates dishabituation in response to novel environmental stimuli.</s></p><p><s>In summary, this study revealed a novel dishabituating role for rapid ACh release within the OB, which is necessary and sufficient to change the behavioral salience of sensory input.</s><s>Here we demonstrated, for the first time, that prolonged odor input leads to decreased responses of excitatory neurons in the glomerular layer and that these responses can be reinstated following brief activation of the cholinergic BF.</s><s>This effect can be replicated in awake, behaving mice through optogenetic activation of cholinergic fibers in the OB alone.</s><s>Furthermore, we showed that this effect is ecologically valid as blocking mAChR activation in the OB blocks visual context change-induced dishabituation.</s></p></div>
