<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>William James famously stated "Everyone knows what attention is.</s><s>It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought.</s><s>Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence" <ref type="bibr">(James, 1890</ref><ref type="bibr">(James, /1918, p. 403-404;, p. 403-404;</ref><ref type="bibr">italics and bold added)</ref>.</s><s>But, what is attention for?</s><s>The present paper builds on the idea that attention is largely in service of our actions.</s><s>What follows is the development of a framework and model of attention-for-action derived from experimental evidence based on studies in the socalled "split-brain" (surgically divided cerebral hemispheres) and related studies on fundamental processes of the basal ganglia, with a key focus on bimanual actions.</s><s>A multilevel cognitive-neural system of attention is built upon processes of a highly adaptive basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system.</s></p><p><s>Historically, studies on attention and conscious experience have focused very much on the stimulus end of processing.</s><s>One might wonder whether our working definitions of attention might have evolved differently had the focus been closer to the "other end," an issue raised many years ago by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Neisser (1967)</ref>.</s><s>In a related vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neumann (1987)</ref> considered focused attention in close relation to action selection using a simple illustration of a person selectively reaching for an apple from a tree, in the context of many other possible actions (or reaching movements to other apples) which could have been performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Franz, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>In a parallel development, others have considered sensory effects as virtually the same as the motor behavior associated with their occurrence, with a modified notion of "ideomotor compatibility" forming the basis of recent accounts in which "stimulus" and "response" are conceptualized as reflecting one and the same perceptual representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Hommel, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The present account is consistent with these parallel developments, and began with the basic question: what is the relation between attention and action?</s><s>In delving into the literature, some prescient insights of early scholars who probed the nature of this relationship became apparent, and a second rather unavoidable question also emerged: what is the relation between attention and conscious experience?</s><s>The present paper begins with a brief recapitulation of those early insights.</s><s>Using these two key questions as guides, it follows with a brief review of initial experimental studies on the "split-brain" and evidence from more recent experimentation including studies from our own lab, culminating into the proposed multilevel framework of attention which aims to address the first question in detail, while also shedding some light on the second one.</s><s>I first provide some working definitions, clarification of the present scope, and a summary of the proposed framework that will then be elaborated along with supporting evidence.</s></p><p><s>Although consciousness is not the topic of this paper, its derivative (i.e., conscious experience) is referred to, which I define as an organism's dynamic awareness of stimulation, which may be associated with sensations, perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and emotions.</s><s>In my view, under normal circumstances most humans possess the capacity for conscious experience and attentive behavior (ala William James) and this can also be said of animals, at least some of them, albeit to differing degrees.</s><s>It is beyond the present scope to attempt to define the constraints of this capacity in the animal kingdom, or the difference in degree to which humans and non-human animals possess consciousness.</s><s>Importantly, attention evolved through millions of years of adaptive changes in a dynamic environment, and in my view, experimentation is crucial in order to capture and ultimately understand critical principles pertaining to time-slices of this process.</s><s>Furthermore, in embracing the basic tenets of evolution my view is that the brain evolved in an embodied manner through interactions with the environment, which also implicates an embodied view of cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Franz, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Franz and McCormick, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Franz and Gillett, 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This framework highlights an evolutionary model based on the notion that rudimentary brain functions have become embedded into increasingly higher (i.e., more highly embedded) levels of networks, with evolution reflected in phylogeny, ontogeny, and adaptive learning.</s><s>A multilevel attention system is summarized herein in terms of three conceptualized levels (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>): Level (1) involves primarily exogenous inputs which essentially capture focused attention transiently when environmental stimuli are salient, unexpected, novel, and/or have emotional significance, so that rudimentary forms of learning first occur in a trial-anderror manner, with eventual associations between sensory effects and motor movements forming elemental action-effects perceptual codes; Level (2) reflects more elaborated forms of endogenous attention in which processes of activation and inhibition enable for sequencing and switching between available action-effects codes (and procedural learning); and Level (3) which is further dependent on endogenous (focused) attention performs a selection-like function (built upon the rudimentary forms of association, activation, and inhibition at lower levels) while receiving strong influences of top-down effects related to prior experiences associated with schemas, goals, and motivations.</s><s>These processes result in a hierarchy of perceptual codes with the highest levels representing goal-related actions, and also contributing to an "automaticity loop" in which expertise and habits result through extensive learning.</s><s>By "higher" it is meant that each level builds upon and embeds the so-called "lower" ones; thus, there are no strict boundaries of these conceptualized levels, with higher levels embedded upon and elaborating processes of lower levels.</s></p><p><s>It is proposed that all levels depend critically on a highly adaptive basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system of which dopamine is a key neurotransmitter (among others).</s><s>The different levels do not FIGURE 1 | The proposed framework underlying an allocation of attention system, presented in summarized form.</s><s>Key processes are highlighted in bold caps at each of the three conceptualized levels of the system, and arrows indicate general direction of information flow, although all levels are highly interacting with many feedback projections not shown herein.</s><s>An automaticity loop is shown in the upper right corner as an adaptive module built primarily upon level 3 of the system.</s><s>In the far left panel is a depiction of the approximate proportion of focused attention versus inattentional processes predicted to be involved at each conceptualized level.</s><s>AE, action-effects.</s><s>See text for details.</s></p><p><s>uniquely point to conscious or unconscious processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lamme, 2003)</ref>, nor does the involvement of focused attention dictate any particular mix of conscious versus unconscious processing.</s><s>However, it is proposed that increasingly higher levels of processing evolved with greater reliance on cortical networks; thus, the higher level networks are built upon (i.e., evolved from) the more rudimentary (subcortical) processes of the basal ganglia and their feedback loops with the thalamus.</s><s>Nonetheless, even lower levels likely involve some cortical inputs, even though intrinsic circuits of the basal ganglia, together with feedback connections with the thalamus, make up the basic functions of the lower levels of the system.</s><s>Key processes ascribed to these levels and their rudimentary forms are described as "focused attention capture" and association (Level 1), activation and inhibition (Level 2), and selection (elaborated forms of the combined effects of capture, association, activation, and inhibition derived from lower levels).</s></p><p><s>The proposed framework has some overlap with specific features of existing models in the literature, which I will attempt to point out where known.</s><s>However, to my knowledge, the formation of a system of allocation of focused attention built upon the key proposed processes (capture, association, activation, inhibition), in combination with a neural model describing an adaptive basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical system, is original to this framework.</s><s>Two additional classes of constraints (not illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) will be referred to as (1) response dependencies, defined as stimulus or response constraints that limit the availability of information to a processing network, and (2) unifying constraints, which condense the information that is available within a processing network.</s><s>Both are described as influences on (and within) the proposed system.</s><s>The latter is viewed as the result of the brain's in-built propensity at all processing levels to unify information into coherent perceptions, thoughts, and actions, something that has been described metaphorically as reflecting forms of conceptual binding, with a loose analogy to binding properties in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Franz, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Franz and McCormick, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In sum, the proposed multilevel system involves highly evolved networks that flexibly allocate focused attention, ultimately shaping our conscious experience.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACK TO FIRST PRINCIPLES: SOME PRESCIENT INSIGHTS</head><p><s>In the 1950s Roger Sperry suggested an utmost challenge when he stated "An analysis of our current thinking will show that it tends to suffer generally from a failure to view mental activities in their proper relation, or even in any relation, to motor behavior.</s><s>The remedy lies in further insight into the relationship between the sensori-associative functions of the brain on the one hand and its motor activity on the other" and furthermore, "the entire output of our thinking machine consists of nothing but patterns of motor coordination" <ref type="bibr">(Sperry, 1952, p. 291)</ref>.</s><s>These ideas, which likely were influenced by the behaviorism prevalent at the time, evolved later into Sperry's growing interest in mentalism, a pursuit of his for nearly three decades following.</s><s>But his statements about sensoriassociative functions and motor behavior struck me as key clues that should be explored further.</s></p><p><s>The idea that the brain is a highly embedded sensorimotor machine dates back to the writings of John Hughlings Jackson based on his personal observations of clinical cases with aphasia and epilepsy among other random conditions, and informed by evolutionary theory as espoused by his contemporary, Herbert Spencer.</s><s>Hughlings Jackson's (1884) basic claim was that the brain is a large sensorimotor machine, with embedded levels of sensorimotor representations, and with higher levels overriding and inhibiting lower levels.</s><s>This idea grasped the imagination of scholars in Psychology, most notably that of William James who referred to "psychical evolution" in terms of simple sensory and motor elements, clearly acknowledging Hughlings Jackson for the explanation that epileptic seizures capture "the loss of consciousness. .</s><s>." due to the most highly organized brain processes being exhausted and thrown out of gear. .</s><s>." <ref type="bibr">(James, 1890</ref><ref type="bibr">(James, /1918;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vol. 11, pp. 125-126)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although in days of behaviorism, it was primarily the"stimulusto-motor-response" that was conceived as the general direction in which sensory stimuli could influence behavior, further experimental evidence and thought has led people to consider the sensory effects of an action, whether they be kinesthetic (as suggested by William James) or derived from other sensory modalities such as audition and vision, as becoming part of a perceptual code for an action.</s><s>This view most closely resonates with the work of Bernhard Hommel, and is embraced in the present paper.</s><s>To illustrate the notion of "sensory effects" or "sensory consequences" consider for example, a low level organism with its basic response mechanisms.</s><s>It responds to the environment, as in the photo response of the flagella in multicellular volvocine algae <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Solari et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>People might argue about whether or not the organism is "aware" of the consequences or effects of such responses <ref type="bibr">(Thorndike, 1913)</ref>, but most would agree that with evolution came an increasing tendency for animals to take note of, or become aware even in a most rudimentary manner, that a response brings food or the avoidance of pain (both of which can be considered sensory effects).</s><s>One might even argue that minimal levels of awareness brought about the development of elemental units of knowledge, and eventually increasing levels of learning, with memories formed in a Hebbian <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hebb, 1949)</ref> sort of way.</s><s>Indeed, the capacity for decision-making about whether or not to respond in the same manner depending on the internal or external milieu after millions of years of evolution has become a hallmark of human behavior.</s></p><p><s>Referring again to Sperry's earlier views, although articulated in a manner that suggested independence from those of Hughlings Jackson, they also clearly reflected a firm grounding in evolutionary theory and underlying sensorimotor processes, dating back to his lucid descriptions of animals lower on the vertebrate scale (i.e., salamanders and lower fishes) as having a nervous system concerned primarily with motor activity, with sensation and perception largely serving the guidance of responses.</s><s>Sperry further suggested that this should be similar in man, given that the operating principles are fundamentally the same, and that "Cerebration, essentially, serves to bring into motor behavior additional refinement, increased direction toward distant, future goals, and greater over-all adaptiveness and survival value" <ref type="bibr">(Sperry, 1952, p. 299)</ref>.</s><s>While I also embrace this view, I would further clarify his reference to "cerebration" as cortical-subcortical networks and circuits, emphasizing research from more recent decades which I will argue, strongly implicates subcortical interactions as essential to a system which allocates our attention to action, in which the basal ganglia and their connective circuits with the cortex, and loops with the thalamus are of primary importance.</s><s>Notably, other subcortical structures such as the cerebellum and hippocampus are undoubtedly also involved, but will not be highlighted in the present paper.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ORIGINAL SPLIT-BRAIN EXPERIMENTS IN HUMANS: A PLATFORM FOR THE PRESENT ACCOUNT</head><p><s>Key clues about focused attention, and also unifying constraints and response dependencies (to be explained further), stem from initial investigations into the so-called "split-brain."</s><s>The medical puzzle of how to ameliorate the bilateral spread of seizures associated with intractable epilepsy led to the procedure which involves surgical separation of the left and right sides of the cerebral forebrain commissures.</s><s>Performed only in rare cases of severe seizures in an attempt to prevent their rapid spread between the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain this procedure also led to remarkable examples of generosity on the part of surgical patients willing to participate in experiments which eventually would completely revise scientific understanding of the human brain.</s><s>Commissurotomy, one form of split-brain, involves surgical separation of an estimated 200 million direct interhemispheric white matter tracts comprising the corpus callosum, in addition to the anterior commissure and the posterior (often called hippocampal) commissure, whereas callosotomy refers to the surgical separation of the corpus callosum alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Levy et al., 1972)</ref>.</s><s>In some references these terms are used interchangeably, but inappropriately so, even though the functional consequences may be similar in some contexts.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Myers and Sperry (1958)</ref> noted that clinical neurologists observed intellectual deficits in patients of these procedures while also pointing out the curious disagreement that "actual observations on the effect of complete surgical section or of total agenesis of the corpus callosum in man and other animals have indicated a surprising absence of deficit" (citing some well-known sources including <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bruce, 1890;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akelaitis, 1944;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bridgman and Smith, 1945)</ref>, clearly revealing that further investigation was necessary in an attempt to solve this paradox.</s><s>However, Sperry's initial writings on the split-brain suggest that his own experiments involved cats or rhesus monkeys <ref type="bibr">(Glickstein and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sperry, 1959, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Schrier and Sperry, 1959)</ref>, not humans.</s></p><p><s>Our understanding of the "split-brain" in humans took a great leap forward with initial studies led by Michael Gazzaniga using clever techniques of lateralization including tachistoscopic presentation in the case of vision and stereognosis in the case of manual perception.</s><s>Initial visual studies on humans with commissurotomy involved presenting images in the form of light flashes, letters, or words, to the left and/or right visual fields separately using tachistoscopic presentation to attempt to ensure separation of input to the two hemispheres.</s><s>Those tests reinforced a most interesting finding, that the two visual fields are mapped to separate cerebral hemispheres, with the left visual field mapped to the right hemisphere and the right visual field mapped to the left hemisphere, illustrating a disconnection (also called "deconnexion") of visual fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gazzaniga et al., 1962)</ref>.</s><s>W.J., one of the three commissurotomy participants of those initial studies, could locate points of tactile stimulation on the fingers of either hand using touches of the thumb on the same hand, even with a 5-s delay following the tactile stimulation, but could not cross-locate such points with either hand to the other despite his ability to locate points stimulated on the head, face, and upper neck with either hand (suggesting bilateral wiring of the involved systems in the latter cases).</s><s>He could produce tapping movements with each hand after being tapped on that same hand by an experimenter, although when tapped on one hand he could not always copy by producing the number of taps with the opposite hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gazzaniga et al., 1962</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gazzaniga et al., , 1963))</ref>.</s><s>Those findings further pointed to a lateralization of both input and output of the distal manual extremities, with each cerebral hemisphere receiving primary input from the contralateral hand/fingers, owning some representation (memory) of that hand's interactions with the environment, and projecting motor commands to that same (contralateral) hand.</s><s>Decades of further study further suggested in other commissurotomy patients that the two hemispheres cannot directly compare visual or tactile stimulus information presented in a lateralized manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Reuter-Lorenz et al., 1995)</ref>, contributing to the host of evidence revealing disconnection in both visual and manual modalities.</s><s>These examples illustrate important response dependencies which limit the availability of information to a particular system, or network (in this case, a cerebral hemisphere), further influencing the system of attention allocation for action.</s></p><p><s>Other clever tasks invented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Gazzaniga et al., 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 211</ref>) include presenting light taps "applied doubly, i.e., at two separate points simultaneously on opposite sides of the body, occasionally at corresponding symmetrical points, but more often at nonsymmetrical points."</s><s>Although those points could be mapped and responded to in the manner described above, "when a subsequent verbal description of the two stimulus points was asked for, those on the left side could not be reported.</s><s>This was true in spite of the fact that the subject had correctly found the point of stimulation with his left hand."</s><s>Thus, what was a conscious experience, as indicated by the left hand, could not be verbally reported (by the right hemisphere), again illustrating a response dependency and what has become perhaps the most important and influential finding in split-brain research and neurology in general (also critically informed by the work of famous neurologist, Paul Broca).</s><s>Specifically, the left hemisphere of the brain houses the speech center, at least in the typical case of the majority of people who are right-handed (and the present review refers primarily to the typical case).</s><s>While some manual responses could be made to information in the right hemisphere, speech responses could not, leading to the conclusion that the right hemisphere might have a level of awareness of its contents and can make responses as long as they are not via the disconnected speech hemisphere.</s></p><p><s>A complementary type of

(e.g., tremor, dyskinesia, akinesia) are proposed to be due to an imbalance of the direct and indirect circuits which comprise the primary architecture of the basal ganglia system, with such a balance contributing to aggregate effects of disinhibition on the thalamic nuclei that receive basal ganglia output to enable for desired motor responses without interfering effects of irrelevant or undesired prepotent responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Mink, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Franz, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Evidence consistent with this model comes from experimentation on simple

of the influence of response readiness on reaction time (RT; i.e., higher levels of response readiness leading to faster RTs compared to low levels of response readiness), this consistent pattern across groups was not found for the force impulse which was modulated with level of response readiness in controls but not in people with Parkinson's disease.</s><s>This led to the interpretation that there is a basic impairment in processes related to conversion of levels of response readiness to appropriate activation of responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Franz and Miller, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, <ref type="bibr">Sperry (1952, p. 302</ref>) alluded to something similar in his earlier suggestion that the function of perception might be "an implicit preparation to respond. . . to prepare the organism for adaptive action."</s><s>Other evidence from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Franz and Miller (2002)</ref> revealed impairments related to inhibition, with inappropriate levels of force occurring in people with Parkinson's disease, for example, in the hand that was not supposed to respond on a trial, which seems to be the flip-side of activation, fitting well with the framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Mink (1996)</ref> in which the direct circuit increases activation whereas the indirect circuit increases activity in the opposite direction (inhibition).</s><s>Thus, the proposed Level 2 of the framework described herein is characterized by rudimentary processes of activation and inhibition of action-effects perceptual codes ranging from elemental ones (as in the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Franz and Miller, 2002)</ref>, to those making up perceptual sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Shook et al., 2005)</ref> and other

involves increasing cortical influences that are part of the highly evolved basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical circuits and the involvement of cortical networks depending on the specific nature of the information.</s><s>Moreover, thalamic feedback loops with the striatum (the input nucleus of the basal ganglia) have more recently been suggested as modifying the classical model of direct and indirect circuits (that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Mink, 1996)</ref>, suggesting a more elaborated model <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(McFarland and Haber, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, as suggested above, the rudimentary processes of association, activation, and inhibition as proposed in Levels 1 and 2 are also involved (perhaps in elaborated and higher levels of processing) in tasks such as sequence learning (e.g., pre-SMA: <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sakai et al., 1999)</ref>, and task switching (particularly implicating prefrontal regions in addition to the basal ganglia:

codes) to higher-order codes associated with sequences or chunks, and in the interest of efficiency, perceptual codes no longer adaptive are replaced with those that are, with a highly flexible allocation of attention.</s><s>Moreover, perceptual codes for highly automatized routines require less focused attention to activate than would a series of codes associate with more elemental movements.</s><s>The flexible allocation of this proposed system therefore depends on many factors related to the task demands and situation (bottom-up and top-down), but also on response dependencies and unifying constraints (such as those earlier described).</s><s>In this manner, the so-called hierarchy of goals (and subgoals) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cooper and Shallice (2006)</ref> is captured primarily in Level 3 which serves to alter the organization and content of stored action-effects perceptual codes.</s><s>Level 3 also incorporates processes of learning in which goal-directed actions become habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashby et al., 2010)</ref>, reflecting the proposed "automaticity loop" (upper right corner of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the fundamental functions of capture and association (from Level 1), and activation and inhibition (from Level 2) are further incorporated into higher-order levels of action-effects perceptual codes (e.g., Level 3), due to the propensity for unifying representations at all levels of the highly adaptive system <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Franz and McCormick, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As

of perceptual codes must also be learned, and this often occurs with very high levels of cognition such as that involved in language <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Franz and McCormick, 2010)</ref>,
