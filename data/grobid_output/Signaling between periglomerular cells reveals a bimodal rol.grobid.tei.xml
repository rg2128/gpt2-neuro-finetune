<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Excitation-driven inhibition is one mechanism for manipulating gain control in brain microcircuits.</s><s>Here we show that interactions between GABAergic interneurons in the glomerulus in the olfactory bulb can, in a dynamic fashion, regulate inhibition of circuit output.</s><s>GABA is depolarizing on these interneurons; however, depending on the activity state of these neurons, it can be excitatory or inhibitory, thereby providing a bimodal regulation of inhibition.</s><s>In the olfactory bulb, activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can drive glutamate-dependent GABAergic mechanisms that allow for timed filtering of incoming inputs.</s><s>These mechanisms can serve to normalize inhibition across the glomerular layer by cholinergic activation, taking into account both behavioral states and the activity history of individual glomeruli.</s></p><p><s>Incubating the slices with 20 μM gabazine (GBz) reduced the fluorescence (integrated over the response) to 15 ± 3.7% of the control responses (n = 63 cells from three experiments; P &lt; 10 -8 , paired t test) which was partially reversed (to 55 ± 6% of the control response) after a 10-min washout (n = 63; P &lt; 10 -7 , paired t test compared with GBz) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, ii).</s><s>We then confirmed that GABA-mediated calcium transients were not unique to young mice.</s><s>From five experiments, JG cells from 75-to 90-d-old mouse OBs also responded to GABA with an increase in [Ca] i (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), indicating that age is not a determining factor.</s></p><p><s>We then confirmed that the calcium signals obtained from GABA type A receptor (GABA A R) activation resulted from depolarization of the cells by testing the contribution of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs).</s><s>Incubating the slices with 50 μM nimodipine and 500 μM nickel reduced the calcium response to 33 ± 3% of control (n = 51 cells from three experiments; P &lt; 0.0005; paired t test), which was partly reversed upon washout (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, i and ii).</s></p><p><s>To confirm VGCC blockade, we measured the effects of the blockers on calcium responses to 70 mM KCl on the same cells.</s><s>The VGCC antagonists reduced the response to a 1-s application of 70 mM KCl to 45 ± 3% of control (P &lt; 0.0005).</s></p><p><s>Based on these results, we asked whether endogenously released GABA from PG cells could result in calcium changes in surrounding neurons, potentially via PG-PG interactions.</s><s>We loaded slices with fura-2AM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>We held PG neurons under a whole-cell voltage clamp using CsCl-based internal solutions containing 10 mM GABA, 200 μM bis-fura-2 hexapotassium salt, and 200 μM Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide (to confirm the identity of the recorded PG cell).</s><s>GluR currents were blocked using 10 μM DNQX and 50 μM AP-5.</s><s>A 100-ms voltage step was applied from -70 mV to 0 mV.</s><s>Images were acquired at 2-7 Hz.</s><s>GBz-sensitive, slow "self-inhibitory" currents were observed following the voltage step (119 ± 42 pA; n = 4 cells out of 7).</s></p><p><s>We measured calcium changes from all JG neurons within a glomerulus before and for 45 s after the voltage step.</s><s>Results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>.</s><s>Following the voltage step, surrounding JG neurons showed calcium transients.</s><s>Surprisingly, responses were not confined to neurons in the vicinity of the voltage-clamped neurons, but were widespread across the glomerulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, i-vi).</s><s>On average, 60 ± 14% of all JG neurons that were loaded with fura-2AM responded with calcium transients (n = 4 experiments).</s><s>We did not investigate the possible spread of the signal across glomeruli in this study.</s><s>The onset of the calcium response in all responding neurons occurred with a ≤1-s delay in the voltage step, suggesting fast propagation of the signal.</s><s>Incubating cells with 10 μM GBz reduced the response by 87 ± 2.4% (data from four experiments; P &lt; 0.0001, paired t test), which was reversed after 15 min of washing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>The recovered response was 52 ± 10% larger on average than the first response (P &lt; 0.05, paired t test).</s><s>Whether this increase indicates some tonic regulation of basal calcium levels by ambient GABA remains to be investigated.</s></p><p><s>The foregoing results are consistent with the idea that GABA is depolarizing in PG cells.</s><s>The surprising finding that depolarizing a single PG neuron can raise calcium levels in most JG neurons raises the possibility that GABA is excitatory and can propagate signals across PG cells.</s></p><p><s>GABA Is Excitatory on PG Cells.</s><s>Smith and Jahr <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> suggested that depolarization by GABA nevertheless blocks firing in PG neurons via shunt inhibition.</s><s>To determine whether PG neurons can fire on activation of GABA receptors, we performed cell-attached recordings from PG cells using recording pipettes containing 200 μM Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide.</s><s>These cells were initially identified by their size and the fact that none of them showed spontaneous bursts of action potentials (APs), a characteristic of the glutamatergic external tufted (ET) cells.</s><s>The idea that PG cells exhibit very little to no spontaneous firing is consistent with recent studies demonstrating the same in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s>All experiments were done in the presence of the aforementioned GluR blockers.</s><s>In six out of six cells, where we successfully broke through into a whole-cell configuration, their identity was further confirmed morphologically (small size, short dendritic arbors; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Brief applications of 25-50 μM GABA resulted in firing of PG cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>GABA-mediated changes in PG cell firing were completely blocked by incubating the slice in 20 μM GBz (n = 4).</s><s>Transient GABA-induced firing in these neurons lasted an average of 3.2 ± 0.85 s, with an average frequency of 6.3 ± 2 Hz (n = 9 cells).</s><s>An additional four cells fired one or two APs on GABA application.</s></p><p><s>Our results suggest that GABA is excitatory on these neurons; however, it is possible that GABA is inhibitory in PG cells but the cells themselves are under a tonic inhibition from other GABAsensitive neurons.</s><s>Thus, application of GABA would result in disinhibition of PG cells by removal of this tonic inhibition.</s><s>Such a scenario implies that under current-clamp conditions, application of GABA should result in depolarization even under conditions in which GABA is hyperpolarizing in the recorded neuron.</s><s>We performed whole-cell current-clamp recordings from PG cells, using intracellular solutions (K-gluconate based; E Cl = -108 mV) that would make GABA hyperpolarized in the recorded cell (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>The resting membrane potential (RMP), determined immediately after going whole cell, averaged -55 ± 3 mV (n = 7 cells).</s><s>Brief applications of 100 μM GABA resulted in no membrane depolarizations, as would be predicted if the excitatory actions of GABA arose from disinhibition of a tonically inhibited cell (n = 5).</s></p><p><s>We examined whether activation of the hyperpolarization activated current (I h ), known to be present in MCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> and a subset of PG cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, contributes to PG cell firing.</s><s>Cell-attached recordings were carried out on PG cells in the presence and absence of 30 μM ZD 7288, an I h blocker <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</s><s>In the presence of the inhibitor, application of 25 μM GABA still elicited firing (mean firing frequency, 1.35 ± 0.37 Hz in controls vs. 2.28 ± 0.73 Hz after a 15-min treatment with ZD 7288; n = 5 cells; P = 0.3) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2 A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with our current-clamp experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), these results suggest that I h activation does not drive the cells above their firing threshold.</s><s>The lack of depolarization in the current-clamp recordings also makes it unlikely that other forms of rebound depolarization contribute to the excitatory effects of GABA.</s></p><p><s>Having ruled out disinhibition or rebound depolarization, we conducted measurements of the reversal potential for GABAevoked currents (E GABA ) in PG cells.</s><s>Perforated patch recordings were carried out using K-gluconate-based solutions containing gramicidin D (Methods).</s><s>GABA currents were measured at various holding potentials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>From a total of six cells, the mean E GABA was calculated to be -49 ± 2 mV.</s><s>RMPs were obtained from seven cells.</s><s>Of these, six cells had a mean RMP of -60 ± 2 mV, and one cell had an RMP of -45 mV.</s><s>This finding suggests that most PG cells rest approximately 10 mV negative to E GABA , thereby making GABA depolarizing on these neurons.</s><s>The observed E GABA would result from an intracellular chloride concentration of approximately 19 mM, assuming that bicarbonate does not significantly affect the GABA reversal potential.</s><s>This compares with intracellular chloride concentrations of 15 mM observed in cerebellar interneurons where GABA is depolarizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and 25 mM in newborn hippocampal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In 10 cells, either with the first GABA application or after repeated application of the agonist, the originally silent neuron went into a persistent firing mode firing at an average frequency of 8.9 ± 2 Hz (n = 7; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 D-F</ref>) after the agonist was removed.</s><s>When GABA was applied to a tonically firing PG cell, its effect was to silence the neuron for a brief period (n = 6; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>A 1-s application of 25-50 μM GABA transiently silenced the neuron (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>), which recovered after washout of the agonist.</s></p><p><s>A parsimonious interpretation of our results (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) is that activation of GABA A Rs results in depolarization-driven calcium flux via the opening of VGCCs and drives the cell above its firing threshold.</s><s>Given that it is possible to evoke both transient and continuous firing in the same PG cell, this is less likely to reflect different subpopulations of these neurons rather than differences in active conductances, including those activated by calcium entry.</s><s>Whether PG cell firing, induced by previous activation of GABA A Rs, provides the necessary total conductance for effective shunt inhibition or whether there are rapid changes in intracellular chloride concentrations remains to be determined.</s><s>The bidirectional effect of GABA also will prevent a potential positive feedback loop that might lead to runaway excitation of the PG cell population.</s></p><p><s>GABAergic Signaling Among PG Cells via GIGR.</s><s>To further demonstrate that GABA released from a PG neuron can result in amplified GABA release within the glomerular network via PG-PG interactions (i.e., GIGR), we asked whether exogenous GABA, applied at a distance, can give rise to spontaneous GABAergic postsynaptic currents (sGPSCs).</s><s>A PG neuron was held under whole-cell voltage-clamp using CsCl-based internal solutions containing 200 μM Alexa Fluor 488 dextran.</s><s>Then 50 μM GABA was applied via a puffer pipette at a location distant to the recorded neuron (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>In some experiments, the puffer pipette contained Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide to track the diffusion of the applied agonist (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, ii), but in most cases, whole-cell GABA A R currents at the recorded PG cell were used as indicators of distance between the recorded cell and the agonist application locus.</s><s>The bath contained DNQX and APV as described above.</s><s>In five cells, 0.5 mM MCPG was also added to block type 1 metabolic GluRs.</s><s>Its addition did not lead to a discernible difference in outcomes, and the antagonist was omitted in other cells.</s></p><p><s>Application of GABA near the recorded PG cell resulted in a large whole-cell current blocked by 20 μM GBz.</s><s>sGPSCs were superimposed on this current.</s><s>Moving the application pipette further away (determined empirically) resulted in a small, delayed whole-cell current with a barrage of sGPSCs preceding it (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, ii).</s><s>Application of GABA resulted in an 11.3 ± 3-fold increase in GPSC frequencies over basal levels (n = 23 cells; P &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>When the puffer pipette was moved away from the recorded cell, to a location where no whole-cell currents were observed from the recorded neuron, the GPSC barrage persisted (8 ± 2-fold increase; n = 5; P = 0.39, not significantly different from cells showing direct activation by the applied GABA) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>The duration of the GPSC bursts was not significantly different in the two conditions (7.6 ± 0.44 s vs. 8.9 ± 1.2 s; P = 0.37, near vs. far) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the difference in time to peak for the frequency increase also did not reach statistical significance (2.7 ± 0.37 vs. 4.7 ± 0.9 s; P = 0.08, near vs. far).</s><s>These results provide evidence supporting GIGR as a potential mechanism for amplifying GABA release in the glomerulus, and also suggest a role for PG-PG interactions in regulating inhibition in this microcircuit.</s></p><p><s>nAChRs Modulate GABAergic Signaling Between PG Cells.</s><s>Are PG-PG synapses activated during OB signaling?</s><s>Although dendrodendritic signaling between PG cells has been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>, the context in which these synapses are activated remains unclear.</s><s>In previous work, we showed that activation of nAChRs in the glomerulus elicits excitation-dependent GABA release from PG cells, leading to the filtering out of MC responses to low-intensity stimuli while maintaining effective information transfer at high stimulus intensities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We asked whether PG-PG interactions are triggered by nAChR activation.</s><s>In this experiment, PG cells were held under whole-cell voltage-clamp.</s><s>The pipette solution contained 200 μM Alexa Fluor 488 dextran to allow for post hoc identification of the recorded cells.</s><s>A 5-s application of 1 mM ACh in the presence of 2 μM atropine (ACh/At) did not result in discernible whole-cell currents from PG cells; however, it did result in a barrage of sGPSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>The mean frequency of sGPSCs rose from 0.88 ± 0.21 Hz to 9.36 ± 1.93 Hz (n = 31; P &lt; 0.0001, paired t test).</s><s>Similarly, on application of 5 μM nicotine, mean GPSC frequency in PG cells rose from 0.93 ± 0.45 Hz to 4.73 ± 1.09 Hz (n = 10; P &lt; 0.005), confirming the nicotinic nature of the responses.</s><s>nAChR-driven sGPSC bursts also were confirmed by measurements from an optogenetic mouse model, where the expression of channelrhodopsin-YFP fusion protein is driven by the choline acetyltransferase promoter (ChAT-ChR2 mice).</s><s>OB slices from ChAT-ChR2 mice were incubated in 2 μM atropine.</s><s>Ten pulse (10 ms/pulse) stimulations of 473-nm light, delivered at 10 Hz, resulted in a brief burst of sGPSCs on PG cells (mean frequency, 0.77 ± 0.3 Hz basal to 4.6 ± 1 Hz on stimulation;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study makes two important observations.</s><s>The first of these is that PG-PG interactions are prevalent in the glomerular microcircuitry.</s><s>Models of OB function need to incorporate these synapses and their unique ability to dynamically regulate glomerular inhibition.</s><s>The combination of excitatory GABA and GIGR provides a previously unidentified mechanism for the regulation of the transfer function across the glomerulus.</s><s>The second observation is that these interactions participate in modulation by cholinergic centrifugal inputs.</s></p><p><s>Connections between GABAergic interneurons are thought to play a role in shaping spatial and temporal features of circuit (F) A model for GIGR.</s><s>Functional nAChRs (red crescents) are expressed on MC primary dendrites and on ET cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>Release of ACh from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (red; 1) activates the nAChRs, resulting in glutamate release onto a population of PG cells (green; 2).</s><s>Excitation of PG cells in turn releases GABA on to adjacent PG cells, resulting in propagation of this excitation via GIGR (black, small arrows; 3).</s><s>This results in amplified GABA release and inhibition of all MCs in the microcircuit (black, large arrow; 4), filtering weak inputs from the ON.</s><s>Runaway excitation of PG cells is prevented by GABA A R-mediated inhibition of PG cell firing, thereby establishing a finite set point for glomerular inhibition.</s></p><p><s>inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>.</s><s>In the OB, the existence of PG-PG synapses has been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref> although whether, or how, they might participate in altering input-output functions of the glomerular microcircuit is not known.</s><s>Our results paint a complex picture of GABAergic signaling among these neurons.</s><s>We show that in PG cells, GABA is excitatory or inhibitory depending on the activity state of these cells.</s><s>In acute slices, as has been suggested from studies in vivo, PG cells exhibit very little if any spontaneous activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s>Under these conditions, GABA drives the cells above their firing threshold.</s><s>In contrast, if PG cells are tonically active, then GABA inhibits firing either by shunt inhibition or by hyperpolarization.</s></p><p><s>The bidirectionality of GABA action could serve to buffer firing rates of PG cells and to set thresholds for glomerular inhibition, thereby acting as a tunable filter for incoming odor inputs.</s><s>Thus, the consequences of activation of the PG network could range from inhibition of MCs to disinhibition, based on the activity history of the microcircuit.</s></p><p><s>The variable and diffuse cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref> and the lack of specific topography within the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca suggest that cholinergic modulation occurs across the bulb, rather than in a glomerular-or odor-specific manner.</s><s>Such an arrangement points to control of more global arousal/attentional processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref> than specific odor-driven modulation.</s><s>Studies measuring ACh levels in real time in actively behaving mice that show a large spike in ACh levels (lasting a few seconds) during the attentional/anticipation phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref> support this view.</s></p><p><s>In the glomerulus, functional nAChRs are expressed on MCs and ET cells.</s><s>Arrival of cholinergic input would excite these cells, setting up a period of inhibition via PG cell-mediated GABA release (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>).</s><s>Consequent GIGR serves to ensure uniform inhibition of all MCs belonging to a glomerulus, thereby setting up an effective inhibitory threshold for information transfer.</s><s>Any odor input arriving within this period will be subject to a filtering effect whereby weak inputs result in failures.</s><s>The duration of this effect would be the combination of the duration of ACh release, nAChR desensitization, and GIGR.</s></p><p><s>The cholinergic effect would be odor-independent and occur at all glomeruli.</s><s>Bimodal regulation of PG cells by GABA would allow for consistency in the filter threshold, normalizing for variability in activity between glomeruli, at any given point in time.</s><s>Differential control might depend simply on open conductance and shunting; however, rapid and transient (at a millisecond to second time scale), activity-dependent shifts in E GABA have also been reported from interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The various parameters that are modulated to allow for such bidirectional control of circuit excitability in the CNS remain to be elucidated.</s><s>In the glomerular microcircuit, PG-PG interactions need to be taken into account to understand olfactory information transfer.</s></p></div>
