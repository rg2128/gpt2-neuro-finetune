target="#b34">(Mori et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>OSNs send their axons to the olfactory bulb (OB) which contains the first neuronal network dealing with processing information about odorants.</s><s>The surface of olfactory bulb is covered with glomeruli, small spherical structures that receive direct inputs from OSNs.</s><s>Each glomerulus is thought to receive direct inputs from OSNs expressing a single OR type.</s><s>In glomeruli, OSN axons are met by the dendrites from mitral and tufted (MT) cells, which, in turn, project onto circuits in a collection of cortical and subcortical structures including the piriform cortex (PC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Haberly, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In insects, OSNs synapse to projection neurons (PNs), putative MT cell homologues, which send their axons to the mushroom body and lateral horn.</s><s>Here we primarily adopt the nomenclature of the mammalian olfactory system, however, most of our conclusions are equally applicable to other vertebrates and insects.</s></p><p><s>Activity levels at glomeruli are considered to represent the pooled and averaged activity levels of OR type projecting to them.</s><s>Because each odorant has a different set of affinities to the set of ORs, each stimulus evokes an odorant specific spatiotemporal pattern of glomerular activation, generating a combinatorial representation of odorant identity <ref

argued to form the basis of a stable stimulus identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wilson et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The concentration invariance in this model results from the assumption that, for any given stimulus, the most sensitive receptor types, and their corresponding glomeruli, would be activated at all concentrations, low and high, and that these glomeruli are activated first during odor inhalation.</s><s>Evidence for this hypothesis comes from the optogenetic masking experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wilson et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>This series of experiments demonstrated that mice use an initial time interval of the sniff cycle as short as ~100 milliseconds to make concentration invariant odor discrimination decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wilson et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>As the aggregate number of OSN types activated by a given odorant increases as a function of time in the sniff cycle and because it takes much longer than 100 ms to activate the full glomerular pattern <ref type="bibr">(Carey, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shusterman et al., 2011)</ref>, it was suggested that relatively few OSN types

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evolution of the olfactory receptors: Twodimensional odor space</head><p><s>To understand the implications of the primacy model for the evolution of ORs, let us first consider a toy model of the world in which only two odorants exist.</s><s>These two odorants may represent two different molecules found in the environment or, perhaps, two molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, i.e. two olfactory perceptual dimensions.</s><s>For simplicity, here, we will treat these two odorants as simple molecules named X and Y.</s></p><p><s>An animal has a repertoire of receptor types that respond to these odorants and their mixtures.</s><s>We assume that receptor-ligand interactions can be approximated by a single parameter, ro K -the affinity of receptor r for odorant o [equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)].</s><s>Affinity is a proxy for the strength of interaction between the OR and the odorant.</s><s>Therefore, in our 2D example, each OR type can be represented as a point in a 2D space of affinities for the two odorants, X and Y, with coordinates ( , ) Similarly, the primacy set corresponding to odor Y can be assigned by introducing pure odor Y at a low concentration and expanding the active zone by increasing the concentration until the first p glomeruli are activated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">rX rY R K K  (Figure 2).</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">2 2 1/2 ( ) X Y C C C  </formula><p><s>).</s></p><p><s>To consider mixtures, we extend equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) for two ligands.</s><s>Assuming the independence of individual ligand-receptor interactions, we have (see Methods section):</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1 r rX X rY Y r f K C K C f    (2)</formula><p><s>This equation can be rewritten in vector form:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 r X Y rX rY r r f C C C K K C q K f C C            (3)</formula><p><s>where is a unit vector in the direction defined by the ratio between mixture components, is the receptor position in the 2D plane of odor affinities, and</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_7">2 2 1/2 ( ) X Y C C C  </formula><p><s>is a total mixture concentration.</s><s>For a given mixture concentration C , the boundary between active and inactive receptors is perpendicular to the unit vector q  .</s><s>Thus, the most active ORs for a given mixture can be found as receptors having the largest projection of their binding affinity vector onto the unit vector (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the primary set of ORs can be found by sweeping the active-inactive boundary perpendicular to the unit vector across the set of receptors toward</s></p><p><s>.

concentrations with the variability in odorant evoked neural activity over that concentration range.</s><s>We suggest the primacy code as a relatively simple solution to this computationally difficult problem.</s><s>We find that under certain assumptions, the primacy model can be tested using the responses of ORs to panels of odorants.</s><s>The statistical tests that we propose could be used to test both the primacy model and some of the assumptions that we have made.</s></p><p><s>According to the primacy model, the identity of an odorant is encoded by the activity of the set of OR types of highest affinity, defined as the primacy set for a given odorant.</s><s>In the simplest implementation, each primacy set includes exactly p OR types.</s><s>The primacy number, p, is therefore an important parameter of this model.</s><s>Because highest affinity ORs are expected to respond with the shortest latency or the greatest magnitude for a range of odorant concentrations, detecting the earliest or strongest responding receptors yields a concentration-invariant odorant representation.</s><s>For example, if Olfr66 and Olfr55 form a primacy set for an odorant (p=2), they are assumed to be the first two OR types activated by this odorant following inhalation onset for both high and low ambient concentrations.</s></p><p><s>If one focuses on the computational problem of determining the identity of an odorant, it is hard to imagine alternatives to the primacy mechanism.</s><s>Indeed, as the concentration of an odorant increases, more receptor types are expected to be activated within a sniff cycle.</s><s>How can the nervous system link the representation of the same odorant of low and high concentrations into the same perceived identity?</s><s>Hopfield proposed a model that attributes an odor identity to the sequence of receptor neuron activation in which concentration is encoded by the latency of OR activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hopfield,

latency and normalization models should rely on the odorant representations emerging at the lowest concentrations.</s><s>It would therefore be interesting to understand the interplay between onset latency/normalization models and the primacy mechanism proposed here.</s></p><p><s>Since neural representations at high and low concentrations are different, it seems straightforward to link them via their overlap, i.e. the ORs that respond at the lowest concentration.</s><s>Thus, the primacy model postulates that odorant identity is determined by the unifying features of the odorant's neural representation across a range of concentrations, i.e. responses of the highest affinity ORs.</s><s>In the simplest implementation of the primacy model described in this paper, it is assumed that the activation order of primary OR activation is not important.</s><s>This is order-independent primacy coding mechanism.</s><s>Alternatively, the order of recruitment of the primary receptors may play a role in encoding odorant identity.</s><s>Approximation of rodent psychophysical performance with a computational model based on a neural network suggests that an order-independent primacy mechanism is

algorithm in compressed sensing terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Krishnamurthy et al., 2017)</ref>, stressing the importance of both high and low affinity OR types in the implicit computation of identity for flexible learning.</s></p><p><s>To derive the properties of the primacy model we have made several assumptions.</s><s>Here, we discuss the impact of these assumptions on our predictions.</s><s>Our main assumptions include: (i) the primacy coding mechanism (primacy assumption) (ii) the hypothesis that the olfactory system samples a low-dimensional subspace in the space of odorant properties (the lowdimensional olfaction), and (iii) the hypothesis that the set of OR has evolved to optimally implement the coding strategy (the evolution assumption).</s><s>We concluded that if the olfactory space is low-dimensional [i.e.</s><s>hypothesis (ii) is valid], the primacy coding mechanism will render many ORs useless, unless they reside along a thin high-affinity boundary that we call the primacy hull.</s><s>Thus, all three assumptions are necessary for the primacy hull to exist.</s><s>If, for example, the olfactory space is instead high-dimensional, i.e. hypothesis (ii) is violated, the primacy mechanism may still be valid.</s><s>In this case, every OR can be a member of the primacy set, and, thus, evolution will favor the retention of all of the ORs in the genome.</s><s>The two statistical tests that we have proposed, the nearest neighbor and frequency of use tests, will both fail in this case.</s><s>This observation suggests that these tests cannot completely rule out the importance of the primacy coding mechanism.</s><s>They are useful only if our basic assumptions are valid.</s><s>If the evolution of ORs is somehow irrelevant, i.e. if the optimization of the receptor repertoire to process a primacy code does not impact an organisms fitness, many functional OR genes may be present in the genome that are not members of any primacy sets.</s><s>In this case, the nearest neighbor test may detect the low-dimensional olfactory space, while the frequency of use test will fail (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9D-F</ref>).</s><s>A similar prediction can be made in the case of failure of the primacy-coding hypothesis: OR responses may be limited to a low dimensional manifold, making the nearest neighbor test valid.</s><s>At the same time, the frequency of use test will fail, as ORs have no reason to reside along a high-affinity boundary.</s><s>Overall, we suggest that the nearest neighbor test can help verify the importance of assumptions (ii) and (iii), while the frequency of use test can falsify hypothesis (i) and (iii).</s></p><p><s>Our approach also adopts the idea that perceptually new odor mixtures can be generated by superpositions of two or more odorants, resulting in a new primacy set.</s><s>Thus, the primacy model is at its essence synthetic, postulating that neural representations of mixtures are not distinguishable from monomolecular odorants.</s><s>Within this approach, different components of odor mixtures can still be identified, if a network is separately trained to identify components based of synthetic primacy representations.</s><s>Thus, experiments in which animals were able to identify individual mixture components <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rokni et al., 2014)</ref> are not inconsistent with the primacy model.</s><s>In one implementation of primacy networks based on duality, for example, it is proposed that olfactory cortex contains synthetic primacy representations, while decomposition of mixtures into components is outsourced to the granule cells of the olfactory bulb <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kepple et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>This suggestion is based, in part, on the observation that the number of olfactory bulb granule cells is similar to the number of known volatile molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kepple et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>One corollary of the synthetic nature of primacy representations, is that synthetic representations exist for both familiar and novel odorants.</s><s>Therefore, within the primacy approach, the cortical representations of both types of stimuli are not different.</s><s>From a statistical standpoint, the simplexes representing novel odorants are the same as the ones coding for the odorants already experienced.</s><s>This property of the primacy model is a consequence of the low-dimensional nature of the olfactory space, i.e. that ORs form synthetic representations that code for a finite set of feature dimensions.</s><s>This prediction is distinct from the model based of Bayesian inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Grabska-Barwinska et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we propose a theory of odor perception based on a small number of assumptions.</s><s>We propose that a concentration invariant odor identity could be computed given a set of olfactory receptors most sensitive to the given odorant.</s><s>We have shown that evolutionary pressure to represent odorants using this primacy model leads to a unique arrangement of receptors along a high-affinity surface.</s><s>This primacy hull is a novel mathematical object.</s><s>We have proposed two statistical tests that could
