<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition.</s><s>Combined, our experiments introduce a new subcortical model of sensory selection, where prefrontal cortex biases thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain, selecting appropriate inputs for further processing.</s></p><p><s>To dissect the circuit basis of sensory selection, we sought a behavior capable of dividing attention across modalities in the freely behaving mouse.</s><s>Building on the rich history of visual neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> , we focused our investigations on visual processing under conditions where vision was behaviorally selected or suppressed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>).</s><s>As such, we developed and validated a two-alternative forced choice cross-modal task where mice selected between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli on a trial-by-trial basis.</s><s>Stimuli indicated the location where a mouse had to nose-poke in order to obtain reward.</s><s>Trial availability and target modality were signaled through binaurally emitted noise.</s><s>In some mice, brown noise signaled a visual target (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref> top) while blue noise signaled an auditory target (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref> bottom).</s><s>Cueing was counterbalanced across mice with no effect on performance noted.</s><s>By design, the task was asymmetric, with a visual detection component (LED flash, appearing to the right or left) and an auditory discrimination component (upsweep; 10-14 kHz or downsweep; 10-14 kHz).</s><s>Multiple quality control metrics ensured that mice performed this task using the biasing cues (brown and blue noise), rather than low-level alternating strategies (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>).</s><s>Performance on the two modalities was balanced (n = 15 mice, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Comparing visual detection under cross-modal and visual-only conditions suggested divided attention between vision and audition in the cross-modal task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, visual detection threshold was higher in cross-modal trials (n = 4 mice, p &lt; 0.05, bootstrap comparison, see Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> for single mouse examples and fixed lapse rate analysis).</s><s>Strikingly, this difference persisted even when the conflicting auditory stimulus was randomly but systematically removed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1e</ref>; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>), suggesting that diminished visual perception under cross-modal conditions is a result of expectation (topdown) not sensory interference (bottom-up).</s><s>Conversely, when mice selected targets based on reward history, detection threshold was unaffected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1f</ref>, n = 6 mice).</s><s>Selective suppression of the visual detection threshold in cross-modal trials was observed both in the raw (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d-e</ref>) and fitted (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>) data.</s><s>Together, these findings suggest that a cued, trialby-trial task design is required for investigating sensory selection in divided attention.</s></p><p><s>Given the known role of PFC in top-down control of sensory processing, and that our psychophysical measurements revealed top-down engagement in the cross-modal task, we asked whether cross-modal performance was PFC-dependent.</s><s>We targeted the prelimbic cortex, given its known homology to primate dorsolateral PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>We used the VGAT-ChR2 animal to disrupt PFC function in a temporally precise manner.</s><s>In this mouse, the lightactivated ion channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is expressed under the vesicular GABA transporter promoter (VGAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Optogenetic drive in this mouse is known to exert intensity-and duration-dependent inhibition of excitatory neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Using this approach, we observed behavioral disruption only when the PFC activity was perturbed during stimulus anticipation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>, n = 4 mice).</s><s>This effect was dependent on the cross-modal nature of the task as perturbing PFC in a visual-only task had no effect on performance regardless of task difficulty (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>, n = 3 mice, ≥ 246 trials per condition).</s></p><p><s>We reasoned that the PFC might be exerting its effect on performance by biasing sensory circuits towards target stimulus processing and distractor suppression.</s><s>Several studies have suggested that this top-down bias is exerted at the level of sensory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>We did not find this to be the case in our task; perturbing visual cortical activity diminished visual performance only during stimulus presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>).</s><s>This effect, unlike that of the PFC, was not cross-modal task specific, as it increased detection threshold in a visual-only task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>, n = 3 mice, ≥ 239 trials per condition, p&lt;0.01, bootstrap comparison).</s><s>An analogous manipulation of auditory cortex resulted in a qualitatively similar impact on performance, but with a larger effect size (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>, n = 4 mice, **p&lt;0.01,</s><s>Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test), likely due to auditory cortical requirement for stimulus discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Overall, these findings support the role of sensory cortical areas in stimulus amplification and discrimination, but are inconsistent with them being a locus for top-down bias of sensory processing.</s><s>Moreover, optogenetic perturbations of frontal regions that directly project to visual and auditory cortices such as anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), did not impact cross-modal performance (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, n = 8 sessions, 2 mice).</s><s>In contrast, localized viral injection of AAV-hSyn-DIO-ChR2 to prelimbic cortex of VGAT-Cre mice followed by optical manipulation disrupted performance (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4d</ref>; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4e-h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Having shown that direct prefrontal-sensory cortical interaction is unlikely to account for top-down control of visual processing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e</ref>), we sought to find the locus of attentional modulation observed in the cross-modal task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>).</s><s>The sensory thalamus has been implicated in attentional modulation in primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> , raising the possibility that it could be a locus of top-down sensory bias.</s><s>Using a similar VGAT-ChR2 strategy, we found that optogenetic perturbation of visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus; LGN) either during stimulus anticipation or presentation, impaired cross-modal performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>, n = 12 sessions, 3 mice).</s><s>This suggested that top-down bias of visual detection may be thalamicbased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2g</ref>).</s><s>Visual thalamic manipulation resulted in worsening performance on both auditory and visual trials, implicating intra-thalamic interactions in this behavioral effect.</s><s>Intra-thalamic interactions are mediated by a shell of GABAergic neurons surrounding thalamic nuclei known as the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In addition, these neurons have been hypothesized to control the gain of thalamic output in a behaviorally relevant manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>As such, we asked whether the TRN could be a locus of top-down modulation of sensory thalamus.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the role of TRN in visual gain control under divided attention conditions, we used a previously employed intersectional genetic/connectivity strategy to label inhibitory (VGAT-positive) neurons that projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) with retrograde lentiviruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), and optogenetically tagged them during extracellular recordings in freely behaving mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>During cross-modal performance, we observed bi-directional modulation of visual TRN (visTRN) neurons consistent with their hypothesized role in behaviorally-relevant visual gain control.</s><s>Specifically, during 'attend to vision' trials, firing rates of these neurons were reduced.</s><s>In contrast their rates were elevated during 'attend to audition' trials (examples Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>, population Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>, n = 138 cells; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, visTRN attentional modulation was eliminated by optogenetic PFC disruption (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>, n = 56 cells).</s><s>While PFC disruption diminished performance, the effects on visTRN firing rates were not simply a covariant of inaccurate performance (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Meaning, in contrast to naturally occurring error trials where diminished visTRN firing rate modulation was observed in both 'attend to vision' and 'attend to audition' trials, PFC disruption had a greater effect on 'attend to audition' trials.</s><s>This result may reflect a role for PFC in distractor suppression.</s></p><p><s>To examine whether the physiological effects observed in visTRN were causal to behavior, we bi-directionally manipulated this subnetwork.</s><s>While activating visTRN resulted in similar effects as driving LGN inhibition in VGAT-ChR2 mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3f</ref>, n = 12 sessions, 3 mice), the effect size was smaller, likely reflecting the weaker nature of the genetic manipulation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>This result supports the notion that elevated visTRN firing reduces visual thalamic gain.</s><s>In contrast, inhibiting visTRN using the light activated Cl -pump, eNpHR3.0</s><s>diminished performance on 'attend to auditory' trials, suggesting it inappropriately enhanced visual thalamic gain when it needed to be suppressed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3g</ref>, n = 12 sessions, 3 mice).</s></p><p><s>To ask whether visTRN firing rate modulation impacted visual processing, we investigated LGN spiking in response to well-controlled visual stimuli.</s><s>We implanted mice with multielectrode arrays targeted to LGN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>).</s><s>To minimize trial-to-trial variability related to slight changes in head and eye position, we changed the nature of visual stimuli from wallmounted to head-mounted LEDs.</s><s>LGN neurons showed enhanced baseline and evoked activity when attention was directed to vision (example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>, population, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d,</ref><ref type="figure">n</ref> = 161 cells, 4 mice), consistent with baseline and evoked neuroimaging results observed in the human LGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Differences in evoked responses were also observed in the visual evoked potential (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4e</ref>, n = 684 visual and 633 auditory trials, 4 mice).</s><s>These physiological effects were not observed during error trials (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Suppression of LGN spiking in 'attend to audition' trials could be a result of direct feedforward inhibition or reduction in feedforward excitation.</s><s>In contrast to many extrareticular inhibitory inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , visTRN is known to exert direct feedforward inhibition on LGN neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>).</s><s>As such, we sought to measure LGN inhibition directly.</s><s>To do so, we leveraged a newly developed technique known as fiber photometry, which had been used to measure bulk changes of intracellular [Ca 2+ ] <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>We modified two aspects of traditional photometry to allow interrogation of [Cl -], a proxy for synaptic inhibition and an otherwise inaccessible measure.</s><s>First was the genetic labeling of neurons with the Cl -indicator superclomeleon <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>This FRET indicator contains cyan fluorescent protein (CFP; FRET donor) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; FRET acceptor).</s><s>As such, under conditions of elevated [Cl -], YFP is quenched and FRET is reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>).</s><s>Second was the light path; we excited superclomeleon with 430 nm light, and collected both CFP and YFP emission to subsequently perform the ratiometric measurements offline (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>).</s><s>To use this technology in vivo, we generated a viral construct harboring superclomeleon (AAV-hSynsuperclomeleon), and injected it into the LGN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We validated superclomeleon FRET as measure of inhibition by two methods.</s><s>First, we reasoned that pharmacological activation of GABAa receptors would increase intracellular [Cl -] and reduce YFP emission.</s><s>Indeed, intraperitoneal injection of the GABAa agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP, 8mg/kg) reduced superclomeleon FRET in a pharmacokinetically predicted manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5d</ref>, n = 3 mice).</s><s>Second, we expected visual drive to result in inhibition of LGN neurons that balanced excitation.</s><s>This indeed was the case and importantly these signals were larger when visual stimuli were delivered to the side contralateral to the recorded LGN compared to the ipsilateral side (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e</ref>, n = 3 mice).</s><s>These rapid events were not observed in YFP control mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10a</ref>).</s><s>Superclomeleon visual transients were sensitive to the GABAa receptor antagonist Flumazenil in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10b</ref>), confirming that they reflect GABAergic inhibition.</s></p><p><s>Having validated Cl -photometry, we asked whether changes in visual gain associated with sensory selection were explained by opposing changes in LGN feedforward inhibition.</s><s>We found this to be the case; visual-evoked Cl -photometry showed significantly larger responses in 'attend to audition' trials compared to 'attend to visual' trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5f</ref>, 363 visual and 274 auditory trials, 6 mice, example trials shown in Supplementary Video 1).</s><s>Importantly, signal kinetics in these two conditions were distinct; auditory selection showed an earlier reduction in FRET ratio than visual selection trials, consistent with the differential baseline spiking observed in visTRN.</s><s>Optogenetic visTRN inactivation eliminated this differential inhibitory response (Fig 5f, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10c</ref>, n = 3 mice, &gt; 82 trials).</s><s>Overall, our data support the model that thalamic gain control can be explained by feedforward inhibition, and that TRN is the source of this inhibition.</s><s>More generally, to our knowledge, this experiment constitutes the first measurement of inhibitory dynamics in freely behaving animals.</s></p><p><s>Seminal studies have shown the thalamus to be much more than a cortical relay <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>By providing a mechanistic circuit dissection of thalamic involvement in divided attention, we extend these studies in two important dimensions.</s><s>First, our findings in mice show the generality of thalamic attentional modulation across mammalian brains.</s><s>Second, we provide a first description, with causal circuit dependence, of how prefrontal top-down control changes thalamic inhibitory dynamics to modulate sensory gain.</s><s>The specific involvement of prelimbic cortex in this behavior, which we further demonstrate through combined optogenetics and chloride photometry (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10d</ref>), does not eliminate the possibility that OFC and ACC may be engaged in other types of top-down control, potentially via cortico-cortical interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>In addition to regulating sensory gain, prelimbic control of thalamic inhibition may regulate the degree by which relay nuclei participate in large scale functional interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The ability to directly measure [Cl -] dynamics provided access to a critical biological variable: GABAa-mediated synaptic inhibition.</s><s>While photometry has already been introduced into neuroscience for measurement of [Ca 2+ ] in cell bodies and terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , FRET-based Cl -had never been previously performed.</s><s>In this study, developing Cl - photometry was essential for establishing a direct physiological link between visTRN and LGN spiking (technical discussion in Supplementary Information).</s></p><p><s>Thirty years ago, Francis Crick proposed that the TRN functions as a searchlight, directing the internal spotlight of attention to thalamo-cortical circuits that process ongoing behavioral demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Due to technical limitations, this transformative model has been difficult to test, particularly under conditions where the attentional spotlight shifts.</s><s>Our study combined novel and established technology to provide mechanistic details for Crick's 'searchlight hypothesis'.</s><s>As such, we have taken important step in understanding the circuit mechanisms of sensory selection.</s></p><p><s>Online Content Methods, along with additional Extended Data display items are available in the online version of the paper;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral setup</head><p><s>Experiments were conducted in a custom-built trapezoidal testing chamber (base1: 12cm, base2: 25cm, height: 25cm) positioned over a grid floor.</s><s>The testing chamber contained three nose pokes, each of which consisted of an IR LED/IR phototransistor pair (Digikey, Thief River Falls, MN) for response detection.</s><s>Activation of a central nose-poke located on the grid floor, 6 cm away from the reward wall, was required for trial initiation.</s><s>Two headphone speakers (Skullcandy, Park City, UT) embedded in the floor delivered biasing cues binaurally.</s><s>Two white light emitting diodes (Mouser, El Cajon, CA) were mounted 6.5cm apart on the base wall below two additional nose-pokes.</s><s>Liquid reward consisting of 10μl of evaporated milk was delivered directly to these wall-mounted nose-pokes via a single-syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems, Farmingdale, NY).</s><s>Access to these response nose-pokes was restricted by a rotating, servo-controlled (Tower Hobbies, Champaign, IL) disk (radius 7cm).</s><s>Rewards could only be accessed from these nose-pokes when two holes in the rotating disk were aligned with the underlying nose-pokes.</s><s>Trial logic was controlled by custom software running on an Arduino Leonardo microcontroller (Ivrea, Italy).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Training</head><p><s>Mice were food restricted to 85%-90% of their ad libitum body weight prior to training.</s><s>Training consisted of multiple levels.</s><s>First, mice were habituated to the test box and allowed to collect reward freely.</s><s>Reward availability was signaled by the rotation of the aforementioned wall-mounted disk.</s><s>The location of reward (left or right poke) was indicated by either a visual or an auditory stimulus.</s></p><p><s>For 'attend to vision' (visual) trials, the rewarded response poke was indicated by illumination of the LED mounted underneath it.</s><s>In 'attend to audition' (auditory) trials, an upsweep (10-14kHz, 500ms) indicated left and a downsweep (16-12kHz, 500ms) indicated right reward.</s><s>To facilitate discrimination learning, sweeps were initially presented in a directional manner.</s></p><p><s>Trials were given in single-modality blocks of six, with alternating block type (i.e. six visual trials followed by six auditory trials) as in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> (top).</s><s>The stimulus was presented until the animal collected the reward.</s><s>An individual trial was terminated 20 s after reward collection, and a new trial became available 5 s later.</s><s>Second, mice learned to poke in order to receive reward.</s><s>All other parameters remained constant.</s><s>An incorrect poke had no negative consequence.</s><s>By the end of this training phase, all mice collected at least 20 rewards per 30 minute session.</s></p><p><s>Third, mice were trained to initiate individual trials, allowing for the establishment of a temporal window in which they could anticipate subsequent delivery of the stimuli.</s><s>For successful initiation, mice had to briefly (50 ms) break the infra-red beam in the initiation poke to trigger stimulus presentation and rotation of the wall-mounted disk.</s><s>Mice were informed about trial availability and modality type by brown noise (10 kHz low-pass filtered white noise, visual trial) or blue noise (11 kHz high-pass filtered white noise, auditory) delivered binaurally.</s><s>At this stage, modality types were arranged in a non-conflicting block design (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, top).</s><s>Correct poking resulted in reward delivery, while incorrect poking resulted in immediate termination of the trial by disk rotation, blocking access to reward.</s><s>Rewards were available for 15 s following correct poking, followed by a 5 s inter-trial interval (ITI).</s><s>Incorrect poking was punished with a time-out, which consisted of a 30 s ITI.</s><s>Mice could not initiate new trials during an ITI.</s><s>To avoid development of side preferences, on trials following an incorrect response the target stimulus would appear at the same location as it did on the previous trial.</s><s>After one week of training on this stage, mice successfully associated the target stimuli with appropriate reward location (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, top row).</s><s>At this stage directionality of sound stimuli did not impact performance.</s></p><p><s>Fourth, mice had to resolve sensory conflict.</s><s>Auditory and visual target stimuli were presented always in a conflicting fashion (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, middle).</s><s>The brown and blue noise cues indicated the modality to be selected.</s><s>Within a session, four different trial types were presented in blocks in repeating order: (1) three auditory trials, (2) three visual trials, (3) six conflict trials with auditory target, and (4) six conflict trials with visual target.</s><s>To prevent modality preferences, an incorrect response resulted in the repetition of the same trial type, thereby specifically increasing the block length of the trial types with weak performance.</s><s>This training stage was introduced to teach mice to only attend to the target modality during a conflict trial.</s><s>Over the course of this training stage (1 week), the duration of the target stimuli was successively shortened to 3s, 1s, and 0.5s.</s><s>In parallel, the time that mice had to break the IR barrier in the initiation nose-poke was continuously increased and randomized to a final range of 0.5-0.7s,</s><s>rendering the precise target stimuli presentation time unpredictable.</s><s>Once mice performed successfully on conflict trials (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, middle) the single-modality trials were removed and block length was reduced to three trials.</s><s>This change in the training paradigm was made to facilitate learning of the trial type cueing (brown and blue noise).</s></p><p><s>On the fifth and final stage of training, all block structure was removed and trial type was randomized (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, bottom).</s><s>We used three measures to ensure that mice followed the trial type cueing and did not employ simple alternating strategies.</s><s>In addition to computing overall accuracy (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, left) we quantified the number of consecutive correct trials (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, middle) and calculated the fraction of correct modality switches (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, bottom).</s><s>At this final stage, rewards were only available for 5 s.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychophysics</head><p><s>For experiments determining visual detection psychometric function, the ratio between visual and auditory trials was adjusted from the typical 1:1 to a 4:1 ratio in order to facilitate the acquisition of a larger number of visual trials while maintaining the divided attention nature of the task.</s><s>In addition, visual stimulus duration was shortened to 0.1s and the light was randomly displayed at one of five different intensities (0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2 lumens).</s><s>To establish the comparison between psychometric functions of visual-only and divided attention trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>) we trained mice that reached criterion (&gt;70% accuracy) on the cross-modal task to perform a visual-only task.</s><s>For one week, mice were trained on a visualonly task every other day where trials containing only visual target stimuli were cued by broadband white noise.</s><s>Subsequently, visual-only trials were introduced into the crossmodal task at a 1:4 ratio and in a random interleaved fashion.</s><s>Mice were found to differentially anticipate visual-only and visual target with auditory conflict trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>) while they continued to perform similarly well on conflict trials with auditory target (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To separate the effect of anticipating a conflicting stimulus (top-down) from the presence or absence of a distracting stimulus itself (bottom-up) we performed two experiments.</s><s>In the first experiment, mice performed the cross-modal task with 70% conflict trials and 30% in which conflict was expected but auditory distraction was removed (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>).</s><s>In the second experiment, mice trained on the cross-modal task had the biasing cues replaced with broadband white noise and the modality rewarded was changed on a session by session basis such that mice would only deduce it based on reward history (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1e</ref>).</s></p></div>
