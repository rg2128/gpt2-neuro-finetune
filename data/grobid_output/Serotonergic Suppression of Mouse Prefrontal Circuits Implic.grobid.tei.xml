nFS, 2/16), predominantly inward currents (less than -20 pA) that were insufficient to elicit spiking.</s><s>These proportions are consistent with the literature on the expression of 5-HT receptors only in a small proportion of L5 interneurons (Abi-Saab et al., 1999; Santana et al., 2004; Rudy et al., 2011; Celada et al., 2013).</s><s>Our findings were not significantly altered by the inclusion or exclusion of these neurons.</s><s>Control experiments with GABA-A and GABA-B blockers suggest that 5-HT receptors on interneurons are not significantly involved in the 5-HT suppression of L6 pyramidal neurons.</s><s>Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that the combined activation of both 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors can inhibit neuronal excitability in L6 neurons of prefrontal cortex.</s><s>However, further pharmacological work is required to examine the specific downstream mechanisms underlying this inhibition of L6 pyramidal neurons.</s><s>Furthermore, additional investigations into the consequences of serotonergic inhibition of L6 on local network dynamics will provide more insight into the nature of these important associative circuits and how they control attention.</s><s>Serotonin, prefrontal attention circuitry, and attention deficits in psychiatric illness Prefrontal attention circuitry is complex, and attentional performance can be perturbed by extremes of mPFC activity in either direction (Pezze et al., 2014).</s><s>Serotonin shapes and biases attention in humans and rodents, with low levels of 5-HT enhancing attention (Schmitt et al., 2000; Gallagher et al., 2003; Booij et al., 2005) and higher levels of 5-HT disrupting attention (Riedel et al., 2005; Wingen et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2015) through 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors (Wingen et al., 2007).</s><s>Stress is well known to raise prefrontal serotonin levels (Adell et al., 1997; Fujino et al., 2002; Bland et al., 2004), and similar behavioral manipulations disrupt attention (Minor et al., 1984; Sänger et al., 2014).</s><s>Intriguingly, elevation of intracortical 5-HT has been strongly associated with deficits in attention (Puumala and Sirviö, 1998) and increases in impulsivity (Dalley et al., 2002).</s><s>Specific activation of 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors results in similar attention deficits (Carli and Samanin, 2000; Koskinen et al., 2000).</s><s>Conversely, infusion of antagonists to 5-HT 2A receptors into mPFC improved performance on attention tasks in rodents and reduced impulsivity (Passetti et al., 2003; Winstanley et al., 2003).</s><s>Although manipulation of 5-HT receptors specifically in mPFC can manipulate attention, certain key experiments (e.g., attention under stress or in models of dysregulated 5-HT signaling) remain to be done.</s><s>Based on our findings, rising levels of cortical 5-HT may increase cortical noise owing to suppression of L6-mediated cortical inhibition.</s><s>Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio is strongly correlated with attentional focus (Briggs et al., 2013; Pratte et al., 2013), whereas deficits can arise from increasing cortical noise in prefrontal cortex (Pezze et al., 2014), Similarly, disruptions to normal excitation of L6 neurons of mPFC can lead to attention deficits in rodents, although previous studies have focused on cholinergic stimulation of L6 (Bailey et al., 2010; Guillem et al., 2011).</s><s>Our study is the first to demonstrate the strong inhibitory modulation exerted on L6 by 5-HT and the resultant decrease in its ability to stimulate interneuron activity in L5.</s><s>Taken together, this evidence shows that L6 of mPFC is a candidate locus of action for the modulatory effects of 5-HT on attention.</s><s>Based on recent work in nonhuman primates (Watson et al., 2015), it is tempting to speculate that 5-HT levels in deep mPFC may modulate the balance between social vigilance and attentional task performance, a phenomenon that is impaired in several neuropsychiatric illnesses.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
