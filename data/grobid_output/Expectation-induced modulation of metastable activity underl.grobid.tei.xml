in unexpected trials the same stimuli are presented in the absence of the cue.</s><s>Importantly, in the general expectation paradigm adopted here, the anticipatory cue is identical for all stimuli in the expected condition.</s><s>Therefore, it does not convey any information regarding the identity of the stimulus being delivered.</s></p><p><s>We tested whether cue presentation affected stimulus coding.</s><s>A multi-class classifier (see Methods and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>) was used to assess the information about the stimuli encoded in the neural activity, where the four class labels correspond to the four tastants.</s><s>Stimulus identity was encoded well in both conditions, reaching perfect accuracy for all four tastants after a few hundred milliseconds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s><s>However, comparing the time course of the decoding accuracy between conditions, we found that the increase in decoding accuracy was significantly faster in expected than in unexpected trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>, pink and blue curves represent expected and unexpected conditions, respectively).</s><s>Indeed, the onset time of a significant decoding occurred earlier in the expected vs. the unexpected condition (decoding latency was 0.13 ± 0.01 s [mean±s.e.m.] for expected compared to 0.21 ± 0.02 s for unexpected, across 20 independent networks; p=0.002, two-sided t-test, d.o.f.=39; inset in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s><s>These measures refer to the decoding accuracy averaged across all tastants; similar results were obtained for each individual tastant separately (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, in the model network, the interaction of cue response and activity evoked by the stimuli results in faster encoding of the stimuli themselves, mediating the expectation effect.</s></p><p><s>To clarify the role of neural clusters in mediating expectation, we simulated the same experiments in a homogeneous network (i.e., without clusters) operating in the balanced asynchronous regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>, intra-and inter-cluster weights were set equal;

p=0.31, two-sided t-test, d.o.f.=39; inset in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A defining feature of our model is that it incorporates excited and inhibited cue responses in such a manner to affect only the spatial variance of the activity across neurons, while leaving the mean input to the network unaffected.</s><s>As a result, the anticipatory cue leaves average firing rates unchanged in the clustered network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>), and only modulates the network temporal dynamics.</s><s>Our model thus provides a mechanism whereby increasing the spatial variance of top-down inputs has, paradoxically, a beneficial effect on sensory coding.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anticipatory cue speeds up the network's dynamics</head><p><s>Having established that a clustered architecture enables the effects of expectation on coding, we investigated the underlying mechanism.</s></p><p><s>Clustered networks spontaneously generate highly structured activity characterized by coordinated patterns of ensemble firing.</s><s>This activity results from the network hopping between metastable states in which different combinations of clusters are simultaneously activated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>To understand how anticipatory inputs affected network dynamics, we analyzed the effects of cue presentation for a prolonged period of 5 seconds in the absence of stimuli.</s><s>Activating anticipatory inputs led to changes in network dynamics, with clusters turning on and off more frequently in the presence of the cue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>We quantified this effect by showing that a cue-induced increase in input spatial variance (σ 2 ) led to a shortened cluster activation lifetime (top panel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>; Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA: p&lt;10 -17 , χ 2 (5) =91.2), and a shorter cluster inter-activation interval (i.e., quiescent intervals between consecutive activations of the same cluster, bottom panel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA: p&lt;10 -18 , χ 2 (5) =98.6).</s></p><p><s>Previous work has demonstrated that metastable states of co-activated clusters result from attractor dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Hence, the shortening of cluster activations and inter-activation intervals observed in the model could be due to modifications in the network's attractor dynamics.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we performed a mean field theory analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> of a simplified network with only two clusters, therefore producing a reduced repertoire of configurations.</s><s>Those include two configurations in which either cluster is active and the other inactive ('A' and 'B' in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>), and a configuration where both clusters are moderately active ('C').</s><s>The dynamics of this network can be analyzed using a reduced, self-consistent theory of a single excitatory cluster, said to be in focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> (see Methods for details), based on the effective transfer function relating the input and output firing rates of the cluster (r and r out , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s><s>The latter are equal in the A, B and C network configurations described above -also called 'fixed points' since these are the points where the transfer function intersects the identity line, r out = Φ(r in ).</s></p><p><s>Configurations A and B would be stable in an infinitely large network, but they are only metastable in networks of finite size, due to intrinsically generated variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Transitions between metastable states can be modeled as a diffusion process and analyzed with Kramers' theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , according to which the transition rates depend on the height Δ of an effective energy barrier separating them <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>In our theory, the effective energy barriers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>, bottom row) are obtained as the area of the region between the identity line and the transfer function (shaded areas in top row of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>; see Methods for details).</s><s>The effective energy is constructed so that its local minima correspond to stable fixed points (here, A and B) while local maxima correspond to unstable fixed points (C).</s><s>Larger barriers correspond to less frequent transitions between stable configurations, whereas lower barriers increase the transition rates and therefore accelerate the network's metastable dynamics.</s></p><p><s>This picture provides the substrate for understanding the role of the anticipatory cue in the expectation effect.</s><s>Basically, the presentation of the cue modulates the shape of the effective transfer function, which results in the reduction of the effective energy barriers.</s><s>More specifically, the cue-induced increase in the spatial variance, σ 2 , of the afferent current flattens the transfer function along the identity line, reducing the area between the two curves (shaded regions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s><s>In turn, this reduces the effective energy barrier separating the two configurations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>, bottom row), resulting in faster dynamics.</s><s>The larger the cue-induced spatial variance σ 2 in the afferent currents, the faster the dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>; lighter shades represent larger σs).</s></p><p><s>In summary, this analysis shows that the anticipatory cue increases the spontaneous transition rates between the network's metastable configurations by reducing the effective energy barrier necessary to hop among configurations.</s><s>In the following we uncover an important consequence of this phenomenon for sensory processing.</s></p></div>
