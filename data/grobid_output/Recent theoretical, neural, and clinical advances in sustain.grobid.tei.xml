<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of Sustained Attention</head><p><s>We first consider how sustained attention is conceptualized.</s><s>Most broadly, sustained attention is differentiated from other classes of attention by the duration of the required activity.</s><s>That is, sustained attention requires an observer to maintain engagement in a specific task (e.g.</s><s>detecting a rare target) over an extended period of time.</s><s>While some researchers impose a lower limit on how long attention must be focused on a specific goal for a task to be considered as measuring sustained attention, such as the 10 sec limit for studies included in the meta-analysis of vigilant attention by Langer &amp; Eickhoff <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , such cutoffs reflect operational definitions and currently there is no consensus that sustaining attention evolves into some unique attentional mechanism after a specific duration.</s><s>This highlights some of the difficulty that arises in delineating what aspects of attention a task measures and why the term "sustained attention" is broadly used across studies.</s><s>In this review, we will mainly focus on classic types of paradigms for measuring sustained attention (e.g., rare target vigilance tasks, continuous performance tasks) though we will also highlight how other non-traditional paradigms can inform models of sustained attention.</s></p><p><s>At the broadest level, attempts have been made to delineate subtypes of attention.</s><s>In an early review of the neural bases of attention, Posner &amp; Peterson 5 defined three subsystems of attention: (1) orienting to sensory events, (2) detection of signals for focal and conscious processing, and (3) alerting, which includes both tonic (over longer time intervals) and phasic (for brief periods &lt;1 sec).</s><s>More recent evaluations of these systems have replaced the detection system with the executive attention system, which still includes the initiation of focal attention at target detection but now also includes other functions such as monitoring and conflict resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, as noted by Tang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , sustained attention is not necessarily synonymous with the alerting system in this three-system model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , but may include aspects of both tonic alerting and orienting.</s></p><p><s>A recent cognitive-based taxonomy developed by Chun and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> dissociates attention subtypes based on whether the target of attentional focus for selection and modulation is external or internal, with external referring to perceptual/sensory stimuli while internal refers to the selection of executive/cognitive control processes including task rules, response execution, decisions, etc.</s><s>Under this taxonomy, sustained attention is not considered a separate system but rather the "challenge of maintaining attentional focus", whether external or internal, over extended periods of time.</s><s>While this model (and others) suggests that sustained attention (A) for time (T) is not just A*T, it remains unspecified.</s><s>Although this conceptualization of sustained attention does not describe the underlying neural mechanisms that support vigilance over time, the model does highlight one of the fundamental behavioral characteristics that has been used to measure sustained attention; namely, the vigilance decrement, or decrease in performance over time.</s></p><p><s>Besides debates about where sustained attention fits into the overall taxonomy of cognition, there is also debate about the source of one of the most fundamental aspects of sustained attention -vigilance decrements.</s><s>The two dominant theories of this phenomenon over the last few decades include the (1) resource depletion (overload) account, which assumes that attentional resources decline with time and thus reduce the amount of attention that can be focused on the task at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and (2) the mindlessness (underload) account wherein repetitive and/or monotonous responses to targets are under-stimulating and lead to disengagement from the task and observed performance deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> .</s><s>Investigations into these models continues to be an active area of research, including studies examining how manipulating target salience mediates mind-wandering and error rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> , and how dualtasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> or interrupting performance with alternative tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> affects performance.</s><s>The results of recent studies have produced findings that are difficult for either theory to fully explain.</s><s>As noted by Thompson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , findings that increasing task engagement can improve performance on some tasks despite increasing task demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> and that self-reported mind-wandering increases with time on task <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> are inconsistent with the resource depletion account.</s><s>In contrast, pure mind-wandering accounts have difficulty accounting for reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> that vigilance tasks are stressful/effortful, and can in some cases be exacerbated by increased load or dual-tasks.</s></p><p><s>In the last five years, two novel models have been proposed that may better account for vigilance decrements and behavioral findings related to task difficulty/engagement.</s><s>This includes the opportunity-cost model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , which proposes that the degree of cognitive resources that can be deployed at any given time is limited but does not wane over time.</s><s>However, the selection of a specific task reflects a cost in that only a limited number can be completed at the same time, and the subjective value of maintaining one cognitive operation over another tends to increase over time, leading to the perception of increased effort.</s><s>The focus in this theory is thus how cognitive effort is distributed based on reward, valuation, and/or motivation, not diminishing availability.</s><s>While the opportunity-cost model can account for many findings in the sustained attention literature, we note that this is a general model of cognitive control, and was not designed to specifically address sustained attention.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, the resource-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> theory was developed to specifically account for sustained attention.</s><s>The resource-control theory developed from findings suggesting that mindwandering (self-generated thought) is the default state for individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and proposes there is a continuous bias for attentional resources to be directed towards mind wandering.</s><s>This is in line with the external-internal dichotomy of voluntary attention developed by Chun and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and current views of mind wandering <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> that attention can be divided between, or focused on, external task goals and internally generated thoughts.</s><s>This model accounts for vigilance decrements by proposing that while attentional resources do not decrease over time, with time-on-task executive control of attention toward task goals does fail as more and more attentional resources are devoted toward mind wandering (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>While the resource-control theory was developed to account for behavioral findings on sustained attention tasks, given the interplay between attentional focus and mind-wandering over time, this model predicts that regions associated with the executive attention network and default network regions should both fluctuate in time with fluctuations in sustained attention performance and they should be inversely related.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, though the resource-control theory proposes a competitive relationship between task-related focal attention and mind wandering, the shift of the control function from attentional systems to a broader executive control system implies that failures of sustained attention can occur in multiple ways.</s><s>In particular, while there may be a pull towards greater mind wandering over time (internal focus of attention) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , such control failures originating from a separate executive control system could also lead to attentional resources being shifted toward external distracters (e.g.</s><s>sensory experiences related to the environment or sensations of physical discomfort).</s></p><p><s>Finally, both the opportunity-cost and resource-control theories suggest that the degree of intrinsic motivation, and thus ability to exert effort, will wane over time.</s><s>However, by manipulating the potential costs/rewards associated with staying on task, it should be possible to directly impact time-on-task decrements.</s><s>Such manipulations have recently been studied using reward paradigms.</s><s>Common motivation/reward paradigms use incremental or trial-based performance-based gains/losses, and as such, the overall value of the task decreases with time on task.</s><s>This may explain why, for example, Esterman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> found these typical reward manipulations increased overall performance (i.e., higher accuracy and lower response variability) while vigilance decrements in performance over time were unaffected.</s><s>In order to keep overall task value constant, another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> was completed where participants had the opportunity to gain a significant reward of $18 if they correctly withheld response to a specific target mountain scene.</s><s>Results here showed that the typical vigilance decrement found in the previous study could be eliminated when the anticipated large reward was withheld until the end of the 10-minute run.</s><s>The fact that changing the opportunity-cost structure of the reward manipulation could eliminate the vigilance decrement is better accounted for by the opportunity cost and resource-control theories than pure resource (overload) theories, and suggests that the perceived value of maintaining high levels of performance on sustained attention tasks can alter not only the overall performance of participants but also changes in their performance over time.</s></p><p><s>Additional pupillometry studies also provide neurophysiological support for motivation and reward modulating sustained attention and vigilance decrements.</s><s>Pupil diameter is known to increase in response to salient stimuli and increasing task demands.</s><s>The degree of dilatation has been shown to correlate with task engagement and is thought to be at least partially driven by norepinephrine released by the locus coeruleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> .</s><s>This provides an important approach to studying sustained attention given that the locus coeruleus is located in the pons and not easily measurable in neuroimaging studies.</s><s>The locus coeruleus has long been thought to play an important role in sustained attention by modulating thalamic and cortical activity, as reviewed by Sarter <ref type="bibr">2</ref> .</s><s>Hopstaken and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> had participants perform a 2hour version of a 2-back working memory task and observed decreases in task performance, self-reported attention to task, and stimulus-evoked pupil dilation.</s><s>However, after 2 hours of task, participants were informed that the remaining duration of the experiment would depend on their performance, with better performance reducing the remaining time.</s><s>Consequently, task accuracy increased, as did stimulus-induced pupil dilation back to levels seen in the initial task blocks.</s><s>Another study 37 used a performance-based monetary reward manipulation of a traditional psychomotor vigilance task and included a secondary delayed discounting task.</s><s>Results here showed that participants increasingly discounted the value of the future monetary rewards as the task duration increased, consistent with the effort required to maintain sustained attention being seen as a cost against which the perceived gain of monetary reward was calculated.</s><s>Additionally, pre-stimulus pupil diameter was larger across the entire block of trials in the reward conditions compared to baseline, and not just during stimulus presentation, consistent with increased attentional effort in higher reward conditions with improved task performance.</s></p><p><s>Finally, while experience sampling, or thought probes, have often accompanied sustained attention tasks like the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , recently paradigms have shown a distinction between task unrelated thoughts (TUTs) that are intentional vs. unintentional, such that intentional TUTs are more related to lack of motivation and greater vigilance decrements <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Collectively, these studies are inconsistent with resource or mindlessness theories alone, and fit with the newer models that take into account motivation and valuation of attentional allocation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recent Developments in Paradigms to Investigate Sustained Attention</head><p><s>In addition to the above theoretical developments, there have also been notable changes in paradigms used to study sustained attention.</s><s>Classic vigilance tasks have involved detection or discrimination of infrequent targets over minutes to hours <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Variants of these paradigms are currently used by human factors researchers (e.g., studying train operation) and have also been used to study the effects of sleep deprivation (e.g., psychomotor vigilance task <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> ).</s><s>Continuous performance task (CPT) paradigms, developed for assessing sustained attention over a shorter period of time, sometimes reverse the frequency of target and non-target stimuli, with responses required to frequent non-target stimuli.</s><s>Though numerous variations of these continuous performance tasks have been developed, two of the most popular include Conner's CPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , which is often used to assess attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the Sustained Attention to Response task (SART) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> , initially developed to assess patients with acquired brain injury and healthy populations.</s><s>One benefit of these go/no-go task variations that has been more recently appreciated is that frequent responses are collected allowing more fine-grained analyses of response time fluctuations, in addition to detection/discrimination accuracy.</s><s>Validating this as a measure of moment-to-moment attention, studies have connected fluctuations in reaction time with increased levels of mind wandering <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>While questions have been raised regarding the extent to which tasks like the SART tax sustained attention versus response inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> , recent findings have shown relationships between performance on the SART and measures of real-world deficits in sustained attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Building on these paradigms, Esterman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> developed a novel go/no-go CPT called the Gradual-Onset Continuous Performance Task (gradCPT).</s><s>The main innovation of this paradigm is the gradual fading of one stimulus image to the next, removing the abrupt onsets and offsets of images and thus exogenous cues that signal trial-to-trial stimulus changes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>With the frequent responses to non-target stimuli, Esterman and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> defined the variance time course (VTC): a trial-by-trial measure of reaction time variability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>Using a median split of trials in the VTC they further define periods of being "in the zone" characterized by low reaction time deviations from the mean, and periods of being "out of the zone" characterized by high deviations from the mean (very fast or slow reaction times), and demonstrated that out of the zone periods are associated with reduced accuracy in target discrimination relative to in the zone periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>Estimates of overall response variability and its relationship to task performance have long been of interest to researchers studying healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> and clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> on sustained attention tasks.</s><s>However, response variability is typically assessed as an inter-individual difference measure using the standard deviation or coefficient of variation of all trials.</s><s>The development of the VTC therefore provides a novel measure that can be applied to multiple tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> ; namely, a time series that allows for moment-to-moment assessments of response stability on any given trial.</s></p><p><s>Recently, several other paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> have been utilized to test a broader range of experimental questions regarding attention fluctuations.</s><s>These include tapping tasks that require participants to maintain a steady rhythm of finger taps over several minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>This task does not include stimulus discrimination/detection, and no accuracy measure is derived.</s><s>Instead, this task allows for estimations of reaction time fluctuations in the absence of external stimuli such that all responses are internally generated.</s><s>This provides an important experimental variation that allows for tests of the extent to which fluctuations in reaction time variability, which are used as behavioral measures of attentional stability, are stimulusindependent.</s><s>Additionally, novel variants of continuous performance tasks have been developed such as the Continuous Temporal Expectancy Task, which includes flickering stimuli that allow for estimations of evoked cortical responses using EEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, novel visual search <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> and working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> tasks have been used to specifically explore the role of sustained attention lapses and motivation in performance fluctuations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural Networks Involved in Sustaining Attention</head><p><s>The last few years have seen an increased interest in characterizing not only task-evoked regional activity, but also understanding how such regions fit within large-scale neural networks that are involved in supporting diverse aspects of cognition.</s><s>While the specific networks, and the labels applied to networks, can shift depending on the study, recent work is pointing to several important transformations in our understanding of the neural basis of sustained attention.</s><s>The following section will outline some of these major contributions including: 1) Sustained attention is supported by distributed neural networks.</s><s>2) The default mode network, which was previously thought of as a "task negative" <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> or "task irrelevant" 65 network, has recently been reconceived as a network that plays a more complex role in supporting sustained attention, specifically, and cognition generally.</s><s>3) Novel paradigms and analyses have allowed us to assess the neural mechanisms underlying sustained attention at a finer temporal scale, assessing moment-to-moment fluctuations in attentional stability, corresponding changes in neural dynamics, and the impact of reward and task engagement on these dynamic relationships.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evoked Activations and the Vigilance Network</head><p><s>In their meta-analysis of 67 fMRI studies on vigilant attention (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>), Langer and Eickoff 3 identified 14 clusters that were consistently activated across various sustained attention tasks.</s><s>These included: 1) bilateral pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and midcingulate cortex extending toward anterior medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), 2) bilateral inferior PFC extending into ventral premotor cortex (vPMC), 3) bilateral anterior insula, including the right frontal operculum, 4) bilateral thalamus, 5) right midlateral PFC, 6) right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), 7) right inferior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), 8) right middle occipital gyrus, 9) left dorsal premotor cortex, 10) left temporo-occipital junction, and 11) the cerebellar vermis.</s><s>As seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>, this "vigilant attention network" spans several other attention-related networks identified with other attention paradigms as well as "task-positive" networks that are not exclusively thought to be involved in attentional processes.</s><s>For example, some overlap is seen with the dorsal and ventral attention networks identified by Corbetta and colleages <ref

variability has long been studied as a marker of inattention in individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84</ref> , and is associated with less deactivation of default mode regions across individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86</ref> .</s><s>That is, default mode activity is positively correlated with overall reaction time variability.</s><s>These findings have led to the "default mode interference" hypothesis of attentional deficits in ADHD, and attention lapses more broadly, which proposes that self-reported mindwandering and disorders of attention are associated with failures to effectively suppress activity within the core default mode regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, however, this association between reaction time variability and default mode activity has primarily been measured across individuals, thus the relationship is between inter-individual rather than intraindividual reaction time variability.</s><s>The recent research findings outlined above pose a theoretical challenge to the notion that default mode activity, response variability, and mindwandering all vary along the same axis.</s><s>Indeed, a recent study by Kucyi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> provide evidence that default mode activity tracks both mind-wandering and attentional stability.</s><s>Using a modified gradCPT task that included thought probes, this study showed that evoked activity in the 30sec prior to a thought probe was both positively correlated with participant's self-reported mind wandering as well as negatively correlated with their reaction time variability.</s><s>Importantly, these correlations were measured for each participant individually, and using a mixed-effects analysis, the authors demonstrate that reaction time variability and off-task ratings provide independent, additive effects in predicting activity within the default mode regions.</s><s>This suggests that spontaneous default mode activity seen during tasks represents not only the degree to which participants are "on/off task" but also includes information regarding their attention state.</s><s>This study, the first to our knowledge to measure the relationship between attentional fluctuations, mind-wandering, and default mode activity within participants, provides compelling evidence that activity within the default mode network contains information about multiple cognitive operations for which general patterns that emerge across individuals cannot fully capture.</s><s>Thus previous models of higher default mode activity indicating participants being off-task or inattentive are not wrong, but rather incomplete.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, another study that helps clarify the seemingly contradictory roles of taskpositive attention networks and fluctuations in performance (i.e., higher activity out of the zone), examined the effects of motivation on neural activity during a sustained attention.</s><s>Using the gradCPT, Esterman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> found that quantitatively, activity within the dorsal attention, ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks, as well as the basal ganglia were more associated with motivated performance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>Qualitative differences in activation were also observed that interacted with moment-to-moment fluctuations.</s><s>When rewarded, participants proactively engaged many of these regions in order to reduce attentional lapses and also maintained similarly high task positive activity during both optimal (in the zone) and suboptimal periods (out of the zone), or fluctuations in performance.</s><s>On the other hand, when unrewarded, the same participants only engaged task positive regions to a comparable degree in response to making errors, and during periods of suboptimal performance, as if in reaction to immediate task demands.</s><s>Thus, not only does reward-based motivation improve sustained attention performance, it also significantly changes one's neurocognitive strategy in a manner more consistent with opportunity cost and resource control models than strict resource depletion models.</s><s>This dissociation is also in line with other models of motivation and cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87</ref> , and further implicates these task-positive brain regions as having a nuanced role in sustained attention where reactive activation (out-of-the-zone) may be a marker of suboptimal attention, while proactive activation (rewarded blocks) may be a marker of optimal attentional.</s><s>The concept of being in versus out of the zone represents intra-individual fluctuations in attentional state and performance.</s><s>Outside of the sustained attention literature, researchers have investigated a similar concept, termed flow, which refers to a subjective state wherein there exists a perceived fit between task demands and one's abilities leading to sense of effortlessness and importantly, a strong sense of intrinsic reward in engaging in the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89</ref> .</s><s>To study flow, recent studies have manipulated how rewarding a task is by manipulating task difficulty including optimal levels of difficulty meant to induce a state of flow, which are compared to very easy or very difficult conditions.</s><s>These studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91</ref> have shown that optimal levels of difficulty are associated with decreases in default mode activity, which the authors suggest reflects the decrease in self-referential processing that is associated with being in a state of flow, and increases in task-positive regions including prefrontal and insular cortex.</s><s>These patterns stand in contrast to the results of being in the zone outlined above, although one area of overlap across these studies is the putamen, which is associated with both reward and being in the zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> .</s><s>One potential explanation for the discrepancies comes from the study of reward and sustained attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> discussed above, which indicates that there are potentially two ways to get in the zone-one is less effortful and/or more efficient, accomplished with less task-positive network activity but at the cost of lower accuracy when unrewarded.</s><s>The other is more about sustaining effort continuously and proactively, as indexed by greater task-positive network activity when rewarded.</s><s>While flow may be akin to a highly rewarded and proactive attentional state, typical "in the zone" performance on sustained attention tasks without reward manipulations are more likely to elicit the former approach.</s><s>It is important to note, however, that the above studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91</ref> manipulate states of flow using explicit task difficulty, which is not dissociable from intrinsic performance variation, while studies <ref type="bibr"

target="#b90">91</ref> measuring in and out of the zone fluctuations look at intra-individual performance, where extrinsic task difficulty is constant, and thus fluctuations are intrinsically driven.</s><s>It thus remains an interesting question for future research to determine the extent to which the concepts of being in the zone and in a state of flow overlap or represent distinct cognitive and neurophysiological states.</s></p><p><s>In sum, recent sustained attention studies suggest that important information can be obtained by examining multiple measures of behavior (e.g., RT variability, experience sampling), and that comparing activity both within and across networks and individuals is critical.</s><s>Indeed, one recent showed that while the level of activity in task-positive or task-negative regions does not differentiate performance, the relative activation between the two networks can predict the speed of responses on a psychomotor vigilance task <ref

particularly implicated loss of structural integrity and/or reduced engagement of right hemisphere regions as being related to cognitive decline with age.</s><s>The associations between sustained attention, the noradrenergic system/right fronto-parietal regions, and cognitive/neural reserve, and the potential sources of these links, are an exciting avenue of future aging research.</s></p><p><s>The myriad of ways in which sustained attention can be disrupted and the extensive interplay of neural networks that are involved in successfully sustaining attention raises the question of whether there is a single optimal cognitive/neural state with many ways to deviate from this state or whether there are multiple neurocognitive approaches to successfully sustain attention.</s><s>Increasing our understanding of how disruptions to sustained attention networks impact sustained attention ability will provide crucial information both theoretically about what successful sustained attention means, as well as clinically in terms of developing novel ways in which to treat sustained attention deficits that may accompany various clinical disorders.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modulating Sustained Attention Ability</head><p><s>Momentary lapses during sustained attention are extremely common and typically benign, but in certain circumstances can have life-threatening consequences.</s><s>For example, lapses have been associated with motor vehicle and operator-related train accidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, persistent deficits in sustained attention can have far-reaching negative impacts on one's quality of life.</s><s>Recently, several novel lines of research suggest it is possible to enhance sustained attention, which has important implications for reducing lapses and improving clinical outcomes.</s><s>Broadly, research on improving sustained attention ability falls within three categories: 1) cognitive/behavioral training, 2) psychopharmacological, and 3) biofeedback/brain stimulation.</s></p><p><s>In terms of cognitive training, several different approaches have been devised to enhance sustained attention.</s><s>One of the benefits of targeting sustained attention is that it underlies or provides a gating mechanism to other cognitive abilities such as executive functions and learning.</s><s>Thus, enhancing sustained attention could generalize to improvements in several other aspects of cognition, a phenomenon which is a rarity amongst cognitive training programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">169,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">170</ref> .</s><s>Meditation training is the oldest and most widely used method to improve sustained attention.</s><s>Though evidence for some forms of meditation improving sustained attention have been mixed (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">171</ref> ), focused attention meditation training has consistently shown to improve sustained attention in a variety of populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">172</ref> .</s><s>Providing strong evidence for generalization, meditation training has also been associated with a variety of improvements beyond sustained attention, including executive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">173</ref> , self-regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">174,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">175</ref> , and mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">176</ref> , and may impact structural integrity of brain regions critical for sustained attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">177</ref> .</s><s>Computer-based cognitive training programs that target cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">178</ref> or directly target sustained attention (e.g., tonic and phasic alertness/attention training, TAPAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">179</ref> ) have also been shown to enhance sustained attention and generally improve cognition.</s><s>For example, TAPAT has shown to improve sustained attention in hemispatial neglect <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">179</ref> , Parkinson's Disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138</ref> , and healthy aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">180</ref> , while also improving spatial attention and executive functions in these populations.</s><s>Together, this suggests that one's ability to sustain attention is highly trainable and improvements in cognitive training can result in more general cognitive improvements.</s><s>Additional studies characterizing the mechanisms of this generalization (e.g., promoting a better attentional state vs. increasing attentional resources vs. increasing motivation) would be useful in further developing these interventions.</s></p><p><s>There already exists an extensive literature on psychopharmacueticals in the treatment of attention deficits, and a full review is beyond the scope of this review.</s><s>Pharmaceuticals that primarily target the noradrenergic system (e.g., guanfacine) or catecholamine system in general (e.g., methylphenidate, amphetamine, modafinil) have consistently shown to improve wakefulness and sustained attention in a variety of populations, including children and adults with ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">181</ref> , patients suffering from hemispatial neglect <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">182</ref> , and healthy adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">183</ref> .</s><s>Research suggest that the effects from therapeutic doses of these pharmaceuticals are relatively specific to the prefrontal cortex, strengthening its functioning and interactions with other brain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">184</ref> .</s><s>In addition to catecholamines, we also note recent interest in the role of the cholinergic systems in top-down attentional control processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">185,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">186</ref> .</s></p><p><s>While pharmaceutical interventions can globally affect neural processing, an alternative physiological approach is localized brain stimulation of cortical regions associated with attention.</s><s>Work into the effectiveness of brain stimulation to increase a variety of cognitive domains is currently being developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">187,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">188</ref> .</s><s>These approaches are combining new knowledge regarding the neural networks the support cognition and testing whether stimulation of network nodes in conjunction with cognitive training protocols can improve performance in both clinical <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">189</ref> and non-clinical <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">187,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">190</ref> populations.</s><s>For example, a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">190</ref> showed that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reduces the vigilance decrement in healthy participants.</s><s>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeted on network-specific cerebellar regions has been shown to change functional connectivity in dorsal attention and default networks, indicating an exciting potential method for enhancing attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103</ref> .</s><s>Finally, other studies are developing algorithms to provide real-time feedback on neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[191]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[192]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref> , with initial results suggesting these approaches may help individuals to monitor and adjust their attentional focus.</s><s>For example real-time fMRI, where BOLD response is analyzed to provide near-simultaneous feedback regarding attentional state (attention focused or distracted), has been used to train attention in healthy subjects, and could potentially help remediate attentional biases in affective disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">194</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p><s>Sustained attention research has been active for over 60 years and the last five years have been no exception.</s><s>Conceptually, questions remain regarding how to define sustained attention and why sustaining focused attention is challenging to individuals (see Box 1).</s><s>Recent cognitive models including the resource-control 27 theory incorporate behavioral findings that task-engagement, motivation, and reward can modulate overall performance as well as performance decrements over time by suggesting that attentional resources do not decline per se, but rather that there exists a subjective cost to devoting cognitive resources to one task which tends to increase over time.</s><s>This cognitive model, however, conceptualizes control failures as arising from executive control functions, which are distinct from attentional resources.</s><s>An open question that remains, however, is whether these conceptually distinct systems have differential neural bases.</s><s>Toward answering these questions, an emerging body of literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> has begun to characterize the fluctuations in sustained attention over finer timescales with concurrent neuroimaging. Alon</s><s> with many of the taskpositive regions identified in a recent meta-analysis of sustained attention 3 , these studies have highlighted extensive interactions across multiple networks and the important role that default network regions may play in supporting sustained attention generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102</ref> , predicting overall sustained attention ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102</ref> and trial-by-trial lapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92</ref> .</s><s>These studies highlight an important change in our conceptualization of the neural bases of cognition.</s><s>Just as focusing and sustaining attention does not occur in an isolated state, but rather operates within and is influenced by the sensory stimuli from the external environment and the emotional and cognitive states of an individual, so too must the neural mechanisms that engage and maintain sustained attention operate in conjunction with, and be influenced by, all of the other sensory and cognitive processes that occur over time.</s></p><p><s>In addition to basic research on sustained attention, studies of clinical populations show that sustained attention deficits are common across a wide range of neurological <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">189,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">195</ref> and psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">196</ref> .</s><s>Emerging evidence suggests that sustained attention deficits are accompanied by changes in neural functioning across a wide range of areas, leading to the suggestion that while there may be one optimal way to be "on task", there are many ways in which sustained attention can be disrupted or suboptimal.</s><s>Future work in this area will continue to provide new information about potential biomarkers to help identify individuals with sustained attention deficits and to tailor treatments to their specific marker of dysfunction.</s><s>Whether with the aim of developing novel treatments, or helping healthy individuals maximize their own potential, gaining a better understanding of the complex network interactions that support the ability to sustain attention remains an important and active research area in cognitive neuroscience.</s><s>Schematic illustration of the mechanisms proposed to lead to vigilance decrements over time.</s><s>This figure shows the total amount of attentional resources available to an observer remains constant over time, as does the amount of resources needed for the primary task (dotted line), while the degree of executive control declines (y-axis).</s><s>This results in a disproportionate amount of resources being devoted to mind-wandering (the combination of the white and light gray portions) and not enough resources being devoted to the primary task (the dark gray portion), resulting in performance costs (the light gray portion beneath the dotted line).</s><s>Adapted with permission from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> of ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>The top panel shows an example VTC for a single, representative participant over the 8min task block.</s><s>The smoothed VTC used in regression analyses is highlighted in blue for the periods when the participant was "in the zone" and orange for when the participant was "out of the zone".</s><s>The bottom panel shows the VTC-BOLD signal correlation.</s><s>Regions in blue are negatively correlated with the VTC (i.e., they are associated with relative stability of reaction time (lower variability).</s><s>Regions in orange are positively correlated with the VTC and associated with relative instability of reaction times (higher variability).</s><s>The bottom panel is adapted with permission from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>     For each seed (left column), regions showing functional connectivity that positively correlated with tap variance are shown in red/yellow.</s><s>These regions are overlaid on an independently defined map of the default mode network <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93</ref> in green to highlight that all significant clusters substantially overlapped with this network.</s><s>Solid lines show the best-fitting functions from a hierarchical regression analysis using segmented linear functions.</s><s>Gray bars show the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated breakpoints.</s><s>Reaction time variability is defined as the coefficient of variation (CV;
