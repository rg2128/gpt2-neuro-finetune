<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>We screened for novel circuits in the mouse brain that promote wakefulness.</s><s>Chemogenetic activation experiments and EEG recordings pointed to glutamatergic/nitrergic (NOS1) and GABAergic neurons in the VTA.</s><s>Activating glutamatergic/NOS1 neurons, which were wake-and REM-sleep-active, produced wakefulness through projections to the nucleus accumbens and the lateral hypothalamus.</s><s>Lesioning the glutamate cells impaired the consolidation of wakefulness.</s><s>By contrast, activation of GABAergic VTA neurons elicited long-lasting NREM-like sleep resembling sedation.</s><s>Lesioning these neurons produced an increase in wakefulness that persisted for at least 4 months.</s><s>Surprisingly, these VTA GABAergic neurons were wake-and REM-sleep-active.</s><s>We suggest that GABAergic VTA neurons may limit wakefulness by inhibiting the arousal-promoting VTA glutamatergic and/or dopaminergic neurons and through projections to the lateral hypothalamus.</s><s>Thus, in addition to its contribution to goal-and reward-directed behaviours, the VTA has a role in regulating sleep and wakefulness.</s></p></div>

delivering AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry into the VTA of Nos1-ires-Cre mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>As for the VTAV glut2 -hM3Dq mice, giving 1 mg/kg CNO i.p. to the VTA Nos1 -hM3Dq mice produced sustained wakefulness (100%) for 4 hours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8c</ref>).</s><s>Also similar to the VTA Vglut2 -hM3Dq mice, the wakefulness produced by i.p. administered CNO activation of VTA Nos1 neurons was not blocked by systemic i.p. administered dopamine D1 and D2/D3 receptor antagonists (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8d</ref>) (note: mice were injected i.p. with the dopamine receptor antagonists 30 mins before CNO i.p. injection -see Methods for drug concentrations).</s><s>Thus, the wake-promoting VTA Nos1 neurons are a subset of VTA Vglut2 neurons.</s><s>Chemogenetic inhibition of these VTA Vglut2/Nos1 neurons, by delivering AAV-DIO-hM4D i -mCherry into the VTA of Nos1-ires-Cre mice and giving CNO i.p., decreased wakefulness and produced more NREM sleep (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4b</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8e</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, VTA Vglut2/Nos1 neurons can bidirectionally regulate wakefulness.</s><s>We next mapped projections of VTA Nos1 neurons by injecting AAV-DIO-ChR2-EYFP into the VTA of Nos1-ires-Cre mice.</s><s>Similar to VTA Vglut2 neurons, VTA Nos1 neurons project to the NAc, VP and LH (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8f</ref>), again implying that the NOS1-expressing neurons are a subset of the glutamatergic ones.</s></p><p><s>VTA Vgat neurons limit wakefulness and induce NREM sleep-We next looked for neurons in the VTA that could potentially restrain the wake-promoting activity of the VTA Vglut2/Nos1

respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>CNO injection i.p. into VTA Vgat -hM3Dq mice produced

reduced to about 10 minutes compared with saline administration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5c</ref>).</s><s>However, latency to REM sleep was significantly increased -there was no REM sleep in the first 6 hours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5c</ref>) [note: we did several further controls for the specificity of CNO's actions to ensure it was not acting as a sedative after conversion to clozapine37.</s><s>We injected 1 mg/kg CNO i.p. into both AAV-naïve Vgat-ires-Cre mice -i.e.</s><s>mice that had not received any AAV injections (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1b</ref>), and into VTA Vgat -mCherry mice (produced by injecting AAV-DIO-mCherry into the VTA of Vgat-ires-Cre mice).</s><s>In neither of these types of mice did CNO alter the amounts of sleep or wakefulness compared with saline-injected controls, (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1d</ref>).</s><s>In a separate study21, we similarly found that CNO systemically injected i.p. at the higher concentration of 5 mg/kg into AAV-naïve Vgat-ires-Cre mice also did not induce NREM sleep above the background of sleep occurring following saline injection21].</s></p><p><s>In converse experiments with chemogenetic inhibition of VTA Vgat neurons, injecting CNO i.p. into VTA Vgat -hM4D i mice produced 100% wakefulness for 6 hours with sustained theta frequencies in the EEG (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5d</ref>).</s><s>There was an increased latency to the first NREM and REM sleep bouts to over 6 hours post-injection of CNO i.p. compared with saline i.p.injected mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next examined if subtypes of GABAergic neuron can induce NREM sleep.</s><s>Subtypes of GABAergic neurons in the VTA include those expressing parvalbumin (Pv), somatostatin (Som), and in the PBP region, Nos1/Vgat34 (see also Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>).</s><s>We chemogenetically activated VTA Pv , VTA Som and VTA-PBP Nos1/Vgat populations in the VTA (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>) by expressing hM3Dq-mCherry in these cells.</s><s>Activation of VTA Pv and VTA Som neurons each produced 3 hours of NREM sleep (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>).</s><s>However, activating VTA-PBP Nos1/Vgat neurons did not induce either sleep or wakefulness (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>).</s><s>Thus, several GABAergic subtypes in the VTA can contribute to induction of NREM sleep, although each group activated individually does not give the full effect obtained with activating VTA Vgat neurons.</s></p><p><s>Lesioning of VTA Vgat neurons produces continuous wakefulness-To look at VTA Vgat function in the sleep-wake cycle over 24 hours, we chronically lesioned VTA Vgat neurons with AAV-DIO-CASP3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11a</ref>).</s><s>About 88% of the VTA Vgat neurons were destroyed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11a</ref>).</s><s>In these VTA Vgat -CASP3 mice, there was an increase in wakefulness in both the "lights on" and "lights off" periods, but especially during the "lights off" period -the VTA Vgat -CASP3 animals slept for only 40 minutes, whereas non-lesioned VTA Vgat -GFP control mice slept 4 hours in the 12 hours of the "lights off" period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6b</ref>).</s><s>During "lights on", the least active period of the mice, the control mice slept for about 7 hours, and the VTA Vgat -CASP3 mice slept for about 6 hours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6b</ref>).</s><s>During "lights-off" the average NREM episode duration of VTA Vgat -CASP3 mice was much shorter, and transitions between vigilance states were dramatically decreased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>The reduced sleep phenotype of VTAV gat -CASP3 persisted unchanged for at least 4 months, resulting in the mice having a permanent and substantial sleep deficit (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>VTA Vgat neurons are selectively wake-and REM-active-Based on the chemogenetic and lesioning results, we might have expected VTA Vgat neurons to be NREM sleep-active.</s><s>To test this, we made VTA Vgat -GCaMP6 mice and measured the activity of VTA Vgat neurons by fiber photometry during different vigilance states of freely moving mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6e</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, as for the Vglut2 neurons, we found that the Ca 2+ signal for the VTA Vgat neurons actually increased selectively during wakefulness and REM sleep (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6f</ref>).</s><s>During NREM sleep the VTA Vgat cells had a lower Ca 2+ signal (Fig.

decreased from wakefulness to NREM sleep, and increased from NREM sleep to wake, and from NREM to REM sleep (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6h</ref>).</s><s>Within an individual bout of wake or REM sleep, the Ca 2+ signal of the VTA Vgat cells did not differ between the earlier and later parts of the bouts (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To search for NREM sleep-active VTA Vgat neurons that might have been missed by fiber photometry, we used micro-endoscopic calcium imaging of these neurons in VTA Vgat -GCaMP6f mice (Supplementary Fig.

freely moving mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">12a</ref>).</s><s>For the single cells that were tracked (16 cells from 4 mice), Ca 2+ levels in VTA Vgat neurons increased during wake and decreased during NREM sleep (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">12b,</ref><ref type="figure">c,</ref><ref type="figure">d,</ref><ref type="figure">e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>This result further confirmed that VTA Vgat neurons are selectively wake-active.</s></p><p><s>VTA Vgat neurons reduce wakefulness and induce NREM sleep by both local inhibition and via projections to the LH-Because VTA Vgat neurons are selectively wake-and REM-on, we hypothesized that they are not physiologically triggering NREM sleep, but they are instead limiting wakefulness.</s><s>To explore how VTA Vgat neurons do this, we conducted ChR2-based mapping of the projections of VTA Vgat axons by delivering AAV-DIO-ChR2-EYFP into the VTA area of Vgat-ires-Cre mice.</s><s>As published previously38, dense VTA Vgat ChR-positive fibers were found locally in the VTA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7a</ref>), but also in the LH area (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7a</ref>), and to some extent in the lateral habenula and dentate granule cells of the hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13a</ref>); a few fibers were also in the PFC and lateral preoptic area (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13a</ref>).</s><s>The especially dense VTA Vgat fibers in the VTA indicate strong local inhibition.</s><s>To test these connections, we did cFOS activity-mapping by inhibiting VTA Vgat neurons with 1 mg/kg CNO injected i.p. into VTA Vgat -hM4D i mice to examine which areas of the brain expressed cFOS protein (by disinhibition).</s><s>After CNO injection i.p., which promoted wakefulness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5d</ref>), cFOS was induced strongly in the VTA and LH (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7b</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Thus, based on cFOS expression as a readout of neuronal excitation, VTA Vgat neurons cause inhibition by projecting to the LH, as well as local inhibition in the VTA.</s></p><p><s>We confirmed directly that VTA Vgat neurons can mediate local inhibition.</s><s>We prepared acute brain slices containing the midline VTA from VTAV gat -ChR2-EYFP mice, optogenetically activated the VTA Vgat neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7c</ref>), and observed the postsynaptic responses in non-Vgat cells.</s><s>Whole cell patch-clamping confirmed that 87.5% of postsynaptic cells (14 out of 16 cells) received either optogentically-evoked (o) oIPSCs only, or both oIPSCs and oEPSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7c</ref>); 12.5% of cells (2 out of 16 cells) had oEPSCs only (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7c</ref>).</s><s>From the relative peak oIPSC and oEPSC ratios, most non-VGAT cells had significantly larger oIPSCs than oEPSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7c</ref>).</s><s>From single-cell PCR profiling, these non-Vgat neurons with oIPSCs were a mixture of VTA Vglut2 , VTA DA , and VTA Vglut2 / DA neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7d</ref>); the two cells that responded with only oEPSCs were VTA Vglut2 and VTA DA cells.</s><s>Thus, the majority of non-Vgat cells in the midline VTA have a large density of inhibitory input from local VTA Vgat neurons.</s></p><p><s>Because midline VTA Vgat neurons inhibit midline dopamine neurons, we examined the effect of this local inhibition on wakefulness.</s><s>We gave D1 and D2/3 receptor antagonists to CNO-injected VTA Vgat -hM4D i mice (mice were injected i.p. with the dopamine receptor antagonists 30 mins before CNO i.p. injection -see Methods for drug concentrations).</s></p><p><s>Without dopamine antagonists, CNO inhibition of VTA Vgat neurons caused 6 hours of sustained wakefulness (as shown previously in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5d</ref>).</s><s>With dopamine receptor antagonists, CNO-induced wakefulness was blocked by 20% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7e</ref>), implying that the sustained wakefulness originating from the inhibited VTA Vgat neurons could be partially due to the activation (disinhibition) of VTA dopamine neurons.</s></p><p><s>To test if VTA Vgat neurons use local inhibition to restrict wakefulness, we infused the GABA A receptor antagonist Gabazine (SR95531) into the VTA of CNO i.p.-injected VTA Vgat -hM3Dq mice (please see Methods for Gabazine concentration) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7f</ref>).</s><s>In the CNO-injected VTA Vgat -hM3Dq mice, Gabazine reduced CNO-induced NREM sleep by 40% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7f</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the sustained NREM sleep originating from the activated VTA Vgat neurons was partially due to local inhibition of VTA Vglut2 , VTA DA , and VTA Vglut2/DA neurons.</s></p><p><s>As blocking local GABA transmission with Gabazine did not completely abolish the ability of activated VTA Vgat neurons to induce sustained NREM sleep, the projections of these VTA Vgat neurons might also contribute.</s><s>We found that following CNO inhibition of VTA Vgat neurons in VTA Vgat -hM4Di mice, the number of cFOS-expressing cells in the LH was strongly elevated compared with saline injections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">7b</ref>).</s><s>About 50% of those FOSpositive LH cells were orexin neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13d</ref>).</s><s>By injecting Retro-AAV-DIO-Chronos-GFP into the LH area of Vgat-ires-Cre mice, we also detected dense retrolabeled soma in the VTA (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The results imply that the VTA Vgat →LH projection participates in NREM sleep induction.</s><s>We therefore placed optical fibers into the LH of VTA Vgat -ChR2-EYFP mice to stimulate the terminals of VTA Vgat neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8a</ref>).</s><s>Opto-activating VTA Vgat fibers in the LH strongly and consistently initiated wake to NREM sleep transitions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8a</ref>); Chronic optostimulation for 3 hours increased NREM sleep and reduced wakefulness and REM sleep (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8b</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, activation could also maintain NREM sleep, with much longer episode duration but without affecting REM sleep duration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8c</ref>), indicating that the VTA Vgat →LH projection is sufficient to promote and maintain NREM sleep.</s><s>However, the EEG power did not differ (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">14</ref>).</s><s>Because cFOS expression is highly elevated in the DG when we inhibited VTA Vgat neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13c</ref>), we also opto-stimulated the VTA Vgat →DG projection, but we did not observe any effects on sleep or wakefulness (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">15a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>The above results imply that VTA Vgat neurons limit wakefulness by both inhibiting locally VTA glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons, but also via projection targets (orexin neurons) in the lateral hypothalamus.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our search for novel circuits that promote wakefulness identified wake-and REM sleepactive glutamatergic/NOS1 neurons in the VTA (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">16</ref> for schematic summary).</s><s>By contrast, we found that VTA GABAergic neurons, when artificially activated, produce a profound sedative state, but surprisingly these neurons, like VTA DA and VTA Vglut2 cells, are selectively wake-and REM-active during normal sleep5.</s><s>Because of this mismatch between physiological activity and the outcome of artificial activation, we speculate that VTA Vgat neurons do not physiologically promote natural NREM sleep, but instead restrain wakefulness.</s><s>This speculation is, in our view, supported by the results of lesioning the VTAVgat neurons (see below).</s><s>Alternatively, there could be rare VTA GABAergic neurons, not detected by fiber photometry or in vivo Ca 2+ imaging, that are NREM sleep-active.</s><s>Such a cell type might actively induce NREM sleep.</s><s>At the moment there is no direct evidence for either idea, limiting wakefulness or rare NREM-active GABA cells.</s><s>There are certainly subtypes of GABA neuron in the VTA e.g.</s><s>Pv-and Somexpressing cells, but we found that activating these also induced NREM sleep, although each subtype activated individually does not give the full effect obtained with activating the complete set of VTA Vgat neurons.</s><s>Future work needs to clarify how the subtypes of VTA Vgat neurons interact to influence sleep and wakefulness.</s></p><p><s>When VTA Vgat neurons are lesioned this causes permanent sleep loss that persists for months (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11b</ref>).</s><s>It will be interesting to identify metabolic changes produced by this long-term loss of sleep.</s><s>The effects of the VTA Vgat and VTA Vglut2 lesions, i.e. more and less wakefulness respectively, manifest selectively during the "lights-off"/ active phase of the mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2b</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11</ref>).</s><s>This fits with multiunit recordings from mouse VTA neurons, where most cells are under circadian control and fire more during "lights off"39.</s></p><p><s>Loss of VTA Vglut2 neurons doubles the number of NREM sleep episodes, and so fragments wakefulness.</s><s>Nevertheless, the effects of the VTA Vgat lesions on wakefulness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6a</ref>) are greater than those of lesioning VTA Vglut2 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2b</ref>).</s><s>It is difficult to predict the effects of ablations.</s><s>For example, histamine neurons, cholinergic neurons and noradrenergic neurons can be triply lesioned without influencing the baseline amounts of sleep-wake40, yet the acute activation or inhibition of these cell groups induces larges changes in vigilance state1.</s><s>We speculate that VTA Vgat neurons are strategically important as they influence diverse targets including VTA Vglut2 , VTA DA and LH-orexin neurons.</s><s>Hence the loss of VTA Vgat neurons produces large effects.</s><s>The persistence of this phenotype (chronic wakefulness) post-lesion, suggests no compensation is possible, and perhaps emphasizes the importance of VTA Vgat neurons in regulating vigilance state.</s></p><p><s>We propose that VTA Vgat neurons limit wakefulness both via projections to arousalpromoting orexin neurons in the LH (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">16</ref>), and by inhibiting glutamate and dopamine neurons locally in the VTA.</s><s>As expected41, we found some midline VTA Vgat neurons co-release glutamate, although the ratio of optically-evoked IPSCs to EPSCs was about 5:1 in favor of inhibition.</s><s>In the LH, many (60%) of the VTA Vgat targets are orexinergic neurons, but VTA Vgat terminals could also inhibit wake-promoting GABAergic projection neurons as well11,15.</s></p><p><s>When VTA Vgat neurons are chemogenetically excited the duration of the evoked NREM sleep is remarkable, lasting some 6 hours, similar to sedation.</s><s>Thus, VTA Vgat neurons could, in principle, be a target for novel sedatives that promote a sustained NREM-like sleep (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">16</ref>).</s><s>It is surprising that this strong sedative effect arising from activating VTA Vgat neurons has not been noticed.</s><s>Previous work emphasized that activating VTA GABAergic neurons effects motivational states by inhibiting dopamine neurons in the VTA42, or by inhibiting cholinergic neurons in the NAc31.</s><s>But in none of these experiments was the EEG recorded, so it is unclear how to interpret the behaviors, especially when decreases in a particular behavior were reported, which could, in fact, be caused by sedation.</s></p><p><s>Inputs or modulators that physiologically excite VTA Vgat neurons will tend to decrease wakefulness.</s><s>The lateral habenula (LHb) is one such nucleus that sends many excitatory glutamatergic projections to GABAergic neurons in the VTA43.</s><s>Thus, strong activation of this LHb pathway would be predicted to induce NREM-like sleep.</s><s>We have found that the anesthetic propofol requires activation of glutamatergic neurons of the lateral habenula to induce sedation i.e. slow wave (delta) power in the EEG and motor immobility44.</s><s>Downstream of the LHb, this mechanism could include the activation of the VTA Vgat neurons, including those GABAergic cells in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus at the posterior end of the VTA45.</s></p><p><s>As with VTA Vgat neurons, the extreme wakefulness produced by stimulating VTA Vglut2/Nos1 neurons may not have been noticed before because no EEG analysis was performed.</s><s>We found that the midline VTA Vglut2/Nos1 neurons promote wakefulness, in part, through the NAc and in part through the LH.</s><s>The VTA Vglut2/Nos1 terminals in the LH could excite GABAergic projection neurons that in turn promote wakefulness11,15, as well as exciting orexin neurons.</s><s>On the other hand, because lesioning the NAc increases wakefulness46,47, this implies NAc GABAergic projection neurons limit wakefulness, or are actively inducing NREM sleep.</s><s>If terminals of VTA DA neurons are stimulated in the NAc, wakefulness is produced5.</s><s>This is similar to stimulating the VTA Vglut2/Nos1 terminals.</s><s>However, since the wake-promoting effect of VTA Vglut2/Nos1 neurons is not blocked by dopamine receptor antagonists, it could be that the wake-promoting dopamine terminals do so by promoting glutamate release in the NAc.</s><s>Similar to our findings, the paraventricular thalamus also promotes wakefulness by sending glutamatergic projections to the NAc17.</s><s>It could be that glutamate inputs local GABA neurons in the NAc, which then inhibit the NREM sleeppromoting GABAergic projection neurons.</s><s>In any case, the NAc is probably a core part of the wake-promoting circuitry.</s></p><p><s>Similar to GABA and glutamate, NOS1 associates with neurons regulating both wakefulness and sleep21,48.</s><s>A recent report found Vglut2/Nos1 projection neurons in the supramammillary nucleus promote wakefulness when chemogenetically activated14.</s><s>Our CNO injections to activate mammillary Vglut2 neurons did not increase wakefulness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1j</ref>).</s><s>The reason for the difference is unclear, but in principle there could be a continuous population of Vglut2/Nos1 cells from the VTA through to the supramammillary nucleus.</s></p><p><s>What is the significance of the VTA Vglut2/Nos1 or the VTA Vgat neurons being REM active?</s><s>Activating the VTA Vglut2/Nos1 or the VTA Vgat neurons did not produce REM sleep, and activating VTA Vgat neurons during NREM sleep did not alter REM sleep duration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8c</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, the VTA Vglut2 and VTA Vgat neurons respond to the primary REM sleep-inducing circuitry, but do not induce or maintain REM sleep.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our findings on VTA Vglut2/Nos1 and VTA Vgat neurons, and other recent discoveries on dopamine VTA neurons5 identify the VTA as a critical center regulating wakefulness.</s><s>The VTA is exceptionally well-connected, receiving glutamate and GABA inputs from nearly all brain areas42,43,49,50, making it well suited to serve as an integrator of vigilance state.</s><s>This should be considered when designing experiments to look at the role of the VTA in reward, goal-directed and social behaviours.</s></p></div>
