<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Using a serial awakening paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , participants were awakened throughout the night and were asked to report whether, just before the awakening, they had been experiencing anything (dreaming experience, DE), experiencing something but could not remember the content (dreaming experience without recall of content, DEWR), or not experiencing anything (no experience, NE, see Methods).</s><s>If subjects reported a DE they were asked to describe its most recent content ('the last thing going through your mind prior to the alarm sound'), and to rate it on a scale ranging from exclusively thought-like (thinking or reasoning, with no sensory content) to exclusively perceptual (vivid sensory content, without thinking or reasoning) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Finally, they had to estimate the duration of the most recent DE, and to report whether it contained specific categories of content, including faces, a spatial setting, movement, and speech (examples of reports are presented in Supplementary table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We studied two different populations in separate experiments.</s><s>In experiment 1 we studied a large group of subjects who underwent few awakenings (N=32, 233 awakenings), while in experiment 2, we investigated a smaller group of trained subjects who underwent many awakenings (N=7, 815 awakenings) (see Supplementary table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>Finally, in a third experiment, we tested whether, based on the results of the first two experiments, we could predict the presence or absence of dreaming in real time at the single trial level (N=7, 84 awakenings).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dreaming experience vs no experience: low-frequency power</head><p><s>First, we sought to determine whether and how low-frequency activity (1-4 Hz) changes between the presence and absence of conscious experience during sleep.</s><s>EEG slow frequencies between 1 and 4 Hz during sleep are associated with neuronal down-states and bistability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , which prevent the emergence of stable causal interactions among cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , and have been linked to the loss of consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>For this analysis we focused on the first group of subjects (experiment 1) because of the large number of subjects, and on N2 sleep, since the number of DE and NE reports in this stage were well balanced.</s><s>By computing power spectral density at the source level within the 1-4 Hz frequency band we found that reports of DE, compared to reports of NE, had decreased low-frequency power.</s><s>This decrease was restricted to a bilateral parieto-occipital region, encompassing the medial and lateral occipital lobe and extending superiorly to the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Experiment 2, in which awakenings were carried out both in N2 and N3 stage sleep, confirmed these results (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We then compared instances in which the subjects reported that they had dreaming experiences, but were not able to recall the content of the experience (DEWR), with instances in which they reported being unconscious (i.e., having no experiences, NE).</s><s>Reports of DEWR, contrasted to reports of NE, were again preceded by decreased lowfrequency power in a parieto-occipital region highlighted by the DE/NE contrast (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for a conjunction map of the two contrasts).</s><s>A contrast between DE and DEWR in the low-frequency range did not yield significant differences.</s><s>Thus, decreased low-frequency power in this posterior cortical zone was associated with reports of dreaming experiences, irrespective of the ability to remember the contents of the experience.</s></p><p><s>Next, we asked whether the contrast between DE and NE would produce similar results also during REM sleep, a state that is substantially different from NREM sleep in terms of EEG signatures (slow waves and spindles in NREM sleep, low-voltage fast activity in REM sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> ), neural activity (widespread bistability between down and up-states in NREM sleep, mostly tonic depolarization in REM sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> ), neuromodulation (high acetylcholine in REM sleep, low in NREM sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> ), and regional activations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Because of the rarity of NE reports in REM sleep (Supplementary table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), for this analysis we combined the data of experiments 1 and 2 (N=10).</s><s>Despite the notable physiological differences between NREM and REM sleep states, we again found that brain activity associated with DE, as compared to NE, had reduced power in the 1-4 Hz band in a parieto-occipital region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), which largely overlapped with the topography observed in NREM sleep (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, a decrease in low-frequency power in a posterior cortical 'hot zone' is highlighted when individuals reported experiencing a dream compared with reports of an absence of experience during sleep, irrespective of the ability to recall the experience and of behavioral state (NREM vs. REM sleep).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dreaming experience vs no experience: high-frequency power</head><p><s>We then investigated differences in high-frequency band power (20-50 Hz), since high EEG frequencies often reflect high rates of neuronal firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and may thus indicate brain regions that show increased activity.</s><s>In NREM sleep, DEs, compared to NE, were associated with increased high-frequency power in the same parieto-occipital region that showed reduced low frequency power.</s><s>However, differences in high-frequency power extended superiorly and anteriorly to parts of the lateral frontal cortex and the temporal lobes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, see also Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for better comparability with REM sleep (25-50 Hz range)).</s><s>DE with recall of content, compared to DEWR, were associated with higher highfrequency power in medial and lateral frontoparietal areas (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>No differences in highfrequency power were found when comparing DEWR with NE (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Finally, in REM sleep DEs compared to NEs were associated with increased high-frequency (25-50 Hz) power in frontal and temporal regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>Given the age variability in our sample, an additional repeated measures ANCOVA was performed in the significant clusters using this parameter as nuisance covariate.</s><s>A significant main effect of report type (DE, NE) was confirmed for both low-frequency (F (1,30) =9.39, p=0.005) and high-frequency activity (F (1,30) =10.88, p=0.003), while no significant effects of age emerged (low-frequency: F (1,30) =2.34, p = 0.14; high-frequency: F (1,30) =1.80, p = 0.19).</s></p><p><s>To test whether our results were characterized by a significant hemispheric lateralization, we computed a repeated-measure-ANOVA with hemisphere and type of report (DE, DEWR, NDE) as within-subject factors for all the contrasts (See 'Online Methods' and Supplementary table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s><s>We did not find significant interactions between the type of report and hemisphere, except for a barely significant right-sided lateralization (p= 0.046) for the high-frequency power contrast between DE and NE in REM sleep.</s></p><p><s>Absolute power values for DE and NE in the posterior hot zone are shown in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>.</s><s>It should be noted that absolute low-frequency power values are higher in NREM sleep compared to REM sleep, although differences are comparable and significant in both sleep stages.</s><s>It is likely that the absolute values in NREM sleep, although obtained from a region of interest after source modeling the signal, are nevertheless influenced by highamplitude slow waves in other parts of the cortex.</s><s>Indeed, source modeling strongly reduces but does not completely eliminate the effects of volume conduction.</s><s>Moreover, regularization methods commonly applied to reduce the influence of noise in EEG data introduce a 'spatial smoothing' of the EEG sources.</s><s>Finally, the effect of slow wave propagation, which occurs on a scale of tens/hundreds of milliseconds is not affected by source modeling approaches and may contribute to the relatively high level of low-frequency activity all over the cortical mantle and in brain areas that are not generating slow waves.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dream content in REM sleep</head><p><s>We further investigated whether differences in high-frequency power could distinguish specific contents of DEs.</s><s>For these analyses, we focused on REM sleep awakenings in trained subjects (experiment 2), because there were many intra-subject trials, reports were more detailed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and subjects were more confident about their answers concerning specific contents.</s></p><p><s>Since dreams can differ greatly along the dimension 'perception vs. thought' <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , subjects had been asked to rate their DEs accordingly.</s><s>We found that high-frequency activity correlated with the thinking dimension in frontal brain regions and with the perceiving dimension in parietal, occipital and temporal areas (p&lt;0.05</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>This anterior-posterior gradient suggests that in dreams, just like in wakefulness, anterior cortical regions mediate thoughtlike experiences while posterior regions are involved in perceptual aspects of the experience.</s></p><p><s>We also examined specific perceptual categories of dream reports.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, DEs containing faces, compared to DEs without faces, were associated with increased highfrequency activity in a circumscribed temporo-occipital region that closely matched the fusiform face area (FFA).</s><s>A region of interest analysis (see Supplementary Methods) confirmed that high-frequency activity in the FFA on the right side was significantly higher for DEs containing faces (p=0.023,</s><s>paired one-tailed t-test) compared to DEs without faces, consistent with the specialization of this area in the perception of faces during wakefulness.</s><s>Subjects were also asked to determine whether the setting of the most recent DE was indoors, outdoors, or could not be specified.</s><s>We found that DEs with a definite spatial setting were associated with increased high-frequency activity in the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>), an area involved in spatial perception and visuo-spatial attention, whose lesion can cause spatial neglect.</s><s>This finding was confirmed by a region of interest analysis (See Supplementary Methods, p=0.023, paired one-tailed t-test).</s><s>Furthermore, DEs in which subjects reported the sense of moving in the dream were associated with increased high-frequency activity in a region surrounding the right superior temporal sulcus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>), an area involved in the perception of biological motion and viewing body movements.</s><s>A region of interest analysis confirmed this finding (See Supplementary Methods, p=0.029, paired one-tailed t-test).</s><s>Finally, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>, DEs containing speech were associated with increased high-frequency activity over a left posterior temporal region corresponding to Wernicke's area, as confirmed by a region of interest analysis (See Supplementary Methods, p=0.048, paired one-tailed t-test).</s><s>It should be noted that an SnPM correction for multiple comparisons was not applied to whole-brain content-based analyses, because content-specific areas were expected to be highly spatially-restricted. Instead, region of interest analyses were used to confirm the specific hypotheses on the involvement of distinct content-related areas.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real-time prediction of dream experience in NREM sleep</head><p><s>If a decrease in low-frequency EEG power and an increase in high-frequency power in a posterior hot zone represents a reliable neural correlate of dreaming, it should be possible to predict whether a person is dreaming or not in real time by detecting ongoing local EEG activations.</s><s>Moreover, this should be the case even though the global EEG, as well as the local EEG in anterior areas, is characterized by slow wave activity typical of NREM sleep.</s><s>To test this prediction, seven additional subjects slept for three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory while high-density EEG was continuously recorded.</s><s>Based on the findings of Experiments 1 and 2, on the experimental (second and third) nights participants were awoken from NREM sleep when their neural activity surpassed a bispectral threshold in low-frequency (0.5-4.5 Hz) and high-frequency (18-25 Hz) band power from an electrode cluster over the posterior hot zone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>; see Methods; the 18-25 Hz range was used because it captures EEG activations while avoiding artifacts from eye movements and other sources during online EEG monitoring).</s><s>In total, participants were awakened 84 times (mean: 12.0 ± 3.4; Supplementary table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s><s>After removal of trials containing artifact (see Methods), there remained 36 awakenings initiated by the algorithm with a DE prediction, out of which 33 were accurate (DE mean accuracy = 91.6%,</s><s>p=0.00001), and 26 awakenings with a NE prediction, out of which 21 were accurate (NE mean accuracy = 80.7%, p=0.0003); total prediction accuracy across all states was 87% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>).</s><s>No interaction was observed between DE prediction and time of night (F (1,6) =1.</s><s>35, p=0.29).</s><s>Confirming significant differences in EEG power in DE compared to NE trials in the prediction ROI, we observed significantly lower low-frequency activity (p=0.001) in DE (10.17±2.5 [mean ± SD]) compared to NE (103.47±38.16)</s><s>and significantly higher high-frequency activity (p=0.001) in DE (0.14±0.03) compared to NE (0.07±0.02) prediction trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>, see also Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>DE had a higher high/low frequency band power ratio compared to NE (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>), especially in cortical regions including bilateral occipital cortex, precuneus, right superior parietal lobule (SPL), right precentral gyrus, left superior and middle temporal sulcus (STS), right lingual gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (p&lt;0.001,</s><s>FDR cluster corrected) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref> and Supplementary table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The three experiments reported here highlight a parieto-occipital 'hot zone' as the neural correlate of dreaming.</s><s>When this posterior hot zone showed a decrease in low-frequency EEG activity -traditionally known as 'EEG activation' <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> -subjects reported upon awakening that they did have dream experiences.</s><s>By contrast, when low-frequency EEG activity increased in the same area, subjects reported that they had been unconscious.</s><s>This result held true whether the subjects had been in NREM sleep or in REM sleep, irrespective of the dominant EEG activity over other cortical regions.</s></p><p><s>The influential notion that dreaming is virtually synonymous with REM sleep has dominated neuroimaging work for the past several decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , despite the increasing number of studies suggesting that dream reports could be obtained from every stage of NREM sleep, albeit less often <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>The frequent conflation of REM sleep with dreaming was eased by the marked similarities between the overall EEG of REM sleep and that of waking consciousness, and little attention was given to the rare reports of REM sleep awakenings that yielded no reports.</s><s>Conversely, reports of dreaming from NREM sleep awakenings were hard to reconcile with EEG patterns characterized by slow wave activity -the opposite of EEG activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, it was suggested that reports of dreaming after NREM awakenings were due to 'covert' REM sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , or even that neural activity in the cortex was unrelated to the presence or absence of consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>The present results resolve these paradoxes by showing that in both REM and NREM sleep, dreaming, and more generally, conscious experience during sleep, requires a localized activation of a posterior hot zone, irrespective of the EEG in the rest of the cortex.</s><s>This explains why dreaming can occur in two behavioral states that differ radically in terms of global EEG signatures.</s></p><p><s>Of course, since the posterior hot zone was highlighted by averaging EEG recordings preceding many awakenings from many subjects, the full neural correlates of experiences in sleep could occasionally include additional brain regions.</s><s>For example, dreams that include insight into the state (so-called lucid dreams) or dreams in which an individual has some degree of control over the content of the dream may recruit additional areas of frontalparietal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Also, when considering unthresholded t-maps (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>), it is apparent that some cortical areas that do not reach significance in the contrast between DE and NE are nevertheless consistently and smoothly highlighted in both experiments 1 and 2. These areas include superior temporal and postcentral regions, as well the midcingulate region, which is also highlighted by contrasts between highly thought-like and highly perceptual experiences in REM sleep (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, we cannot rule out that the posterior hot zone may include, besides brain regions supporting experiences, areas that might support unconscious aspects of dream generation.</s><s>However, many studies contrasting perceiving or not specific sensory stimuli during wakefulness (such as seeing/not seeing a face, an object, a place, a movement, and so on) also point to regions within the posterior hot zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>EEG source modeling indicates that, in addition to low and high-level sensory areas (primarily visual), the posterior hot zone prominently includes precuneus, posterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices: areas on the medial surface of the brain whose electrical stimulation can induce a feeling of being 'in a parallel world' <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , disconnected from the environment in a 'dream-like state' <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , and whose involvement in multisensory integration is well-suited to support the virtual simulation of a world <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and the 'immersive spatio-temporal hallucinations' 27 that characterize dreams.</s></p><p><s>The posterior hot zone was also highlighted by the contrast between the absence of experiences and experiences without recall of specific contents of the experience.</s><s>This finding further suggests that the activation of this posterior hot zone is a marker of experiences themselves, rather than of the recall of experiences.</s><s>The trustworthiness of subjective dream reports has often been called into question and has generated much controversy in the past.</s><s>Indeed, it is particularly delicate to distinguish the absence of experience from forgotten experiences in this context.</s><s>Therefore, to reduce potential biases associated with collecting reports, we followed standardized experimental protocols.</s><s>Specifically, to avoid interfering with dream recall or introducing variability in dream recall, subjects were always interviewed just after being awakened from a dream (short temporal lag) and in identical experimental conditions (lying on their back, with eyes closed, without the examiner entering the room).</s><s>In addition, in experiment 2 subjects were trained in dream reporting so as not to introduce a 'learning bias' in recalling dream experiences.</s><s>Our results, which show, for the first time, that reports of absent and forgotten dream experiences carry distinct EEG signatures, should encourage the current tendency to take subjective reports of conscious experience at face value, i.e. as the best inference to scientific explanation, provided that carefully designed experimental protocols are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>In line with our results, both lesion studies and neuroimaging results indicate that specific contents of experiences are supported by posterior cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , while a different set of brain areas are involved in encoding and storing memories and in directing attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>The results we obtained were also virtually identical in naïve subjects (Experiment 1) and in trained subjects (Experiment 2), suggesting that they characterize a core correlate of dream experience, rather than some other cognitive function.</s></p><p><s>In our experiments conscious experiences were consistently associated with low activity in the delta range (1-4 Hz) and the absence of experience with high delta activity in the posterior hot zone.</s><s>During NREM sleep, EEG slow waves in the delta range reflect alternations between periods of depolarization (up-states), during which neurons can fire, and periods of hyperpolarization (down-states) during which neurons cease firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>This bistability of membrane potential causes the breakdown of stable causal interactions among cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , which are thought to be necessary for sustaining conscious experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Recently, the occurrence of local slow waves has also been discovered during REM sleep, especially in the supragranular layers of primary cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , adding to the evidence that neuronal activity during sleep can have a local component <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>A global slowing of EEG activity into the delta range had been associated with loss of consciousness in many previous

target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , including of course NREM sleep itself, where global slow wave activity is present despite the frequent occurrence of dreaming.</s><s>The present findings suggest that future work in patients with disorders of consciousness, epileptic seizures, or under general anesthesia should examine the level of EEG activation in the posterior hot zone to uncover the possible occurrence of consciousness despite the loss of responsiveness.</s></p><p><s>In addition to differences in EEG low-frequency activity in the posterior hot zone, we found that this region also showed increased high-frequency activity when subjects reported dreaming experiences during sleep.</s><s>High-frequency activity usually reflects increased neuronal firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>A plausible interpretation of this finding is that, as long as the posterior hot zone is not in a low-frequency mode that prevents experiences, the specific contents of experiences when dreaming are dictated by which specific groups of neurons fire strongly and which do not, just as in wake.</s><s>Consistent with this, we found that specific contents of a subject's REM sleep dream -such as thoughts, perceptions, faces, places, movement, and speech -are associated with increased high-frequency EEG activity in specific cortical areas, which correspond closely to those engaged during waking perception of the same contents.</s><s>Although these differences extended only over a few voxels and were statistically weaker than the contrasts between DE and NE, their temporal distribution (maximal in the two seconds before the awakening), and spatial localization (similar to waking perception of the same contents) strongly support our interpretation.</s><s>In a recent fMRI study, a pattern classifier trained while subjects perceived natural images during wakefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> was able to successfully decode specific content categories reported by subjects awakened at the transition between wakefulness and sleep.</s><s>Our results with high-density EEG extend these findings beyond falling asleep to periods of consolidated sleep, providing further evidence that dream reports reflect conscious experience during sleep rather than confabulations upon awakening <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Increased high-frequency activity associated with reports of dreaming experiences were also observed in areas that went beyond the posterior hot zone.</s><s>Thus, increased high-frequency activity extended to some portions of prefrontal cortex during REM sleep dreaming, especially for thought-like experiences.</s><s>Moreover, a frontal cluster (Fig 3B ) showed increase high-frequency activity during NREM sleep when contrasting experiences with and without recall of content, suggesting that this area may be important for recall of the content of the experience.</s><s>Neuronal activity in the gamma range was initially linked to consciousness, but later studies showed that consciousness and gamma activity can be dissociated <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>For example, one can be aware of a stimulus whether or not it triggers gamma activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and gamma activity can be strong during general anesthesia in the presence of low frequency oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>However, recent studies have reported that gamma-band transcranial alternating current stimulation is associated with higher scores on the revised coma scale recovery scale (CRS-R) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> or self-awareness during REM sleep dreams <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , suggesting that high-frequency activity may indeed influence functions related to cognition or awareness.</s><s>It is thus an open question whether high-frequency activity in a subset of prefrontal regions may contribute some specific contents to experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , such as conscious thought or mindwandering states <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> , emotional/motivational contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , metacognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , or insight into one's state (i.e., lucid dreaming) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Alternatively, high-frequency activity in prefrontal regions may mediate cognitive functions that are unconscious but affect experience indirectly, such as the encoding and storing of long-term memories, the deployment of attention, and the planning and execution of tasks.</s></p><p><s>Finally, this study suggests that dreaming may constitute a valuable model for the study of consciousness with implications beyond sleep.</s><s>First, the direct comparison between consciousness (the presence of experience) and unconsciousness (the absence of experience) within the same behavioral state avoids confounds that limit the interpretation of betweenstates paradigms.</s><s>These confounds arise because, in studies contrasting wakefulness with sleep, anesthesia, or coma, many other aspects of brain function besides consciousness change along with behavioral state changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Second, during sleep subjects are largely disconnected from the environment on both the input and output side, meaning that in the majority of cases, sensory stimuli do not influence the content of experience 2 .</s><s>Third, during sleep subjects are not performing an experimental task, avoiding confounds caused by stimulus processing, response preparation, and execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s></p><p><s>An influential notion derived from neuroimaging studies contrasting wake with NREM sleep, anesthesia, or coma is that the neural correlates of consciousness would correspond to a broad fronto-parietal network <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>This notion has been reinforced by findings indicating that the same fronto-parietal network is activated when contrasting brain responses to the same stimuli when subjects reported seeing them or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>However, lesion studies suggest that consciousness persists after widespread frontal lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> and recent work controlling for confounding factors related to stimulus processing, attention, and task performance have cast doubt on a central role of this fronto-parietal network in supporting consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>By exploiting a within state, no stimulus, no task paradigm, our findings indicate that the neural correlate of consciousness, rather than involving the broad lateral
