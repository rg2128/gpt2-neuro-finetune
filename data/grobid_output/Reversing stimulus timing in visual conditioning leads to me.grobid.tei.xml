<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of stimulus timing on visual memory</head><p><s>Using the conditions specified above, we trained independent groups of flies with ISIs varying from -64 s (the onset of the paired color preceded the onset of shock by 64 s) to +96 s (the onset of the paired color followed the onset of the shock by 96 s).</s><s>No significant scores were found with very long ISIs in either direction (ISI = -64 s, -49 s and +96 s, Interestingly, when the paired color followed the shock with overlap, flies showed weak or no conditioned avoidance (ISI = +4 s and +11 s, Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, black data points).</s><s>Critically however, when the paired color followed the shock with a temporal gap, flies approached the paired color in the test, suggesting relief conditioning (ISI = +19 s to +76 s, Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, black data points).</s><s>Thus, reversing stimulus timing indeed led to valence reversal in visual memory.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>By using a classical conditioning setup with visual chromatic cues and electric shock reinforcement we showed that fruit flies form memories of opposite valence depending on the relative timing of stimuli during training, as is the case for the olfactory modality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, flies can associate a visual stimulus with a delayed and temporally non-overlapping aversive reinforcement, similar to effects reported in olfactory conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The shapes of the ISI-learning curves in both modalities are similar: Conditioning with negative ISIs generates a sharper response peak with stronger scores than conditioning with positive ISIs (compare Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>).</s><s>These parametric similarities across modalities may point to a common underlying molecular mechanism.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trace conditioning: visual vs. olfactory modalities</head><p><s>A caveat of the olfactory conditioning paradigm is that residues of the odor may remain in the setup, confounding trace conditioning experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In experiments presented here, this concern does not apply.</s><s>Therefore, the time gap between the paired color presentation and electric shock should be bridged by cellular and/ or molecular mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>In visual conditioning, our analyses revealed that: (i) a minimum duration for visual stimulus presentation is necessary to establish significant conditioned avoidance (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>  .</s><s>These features are similar to those found in other associative learning paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, in visual trace conditioning, we found the duration of the temporal gap between the visual stimulus and the reinforcement to be a strong determinant of conditioned avoidance: Prolonged duration of the time gap steadily decreased memory performance (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, grey data points), in agreement with key features of olfactory trace conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> and possibly pointing to a common underlying mechanism.</s><s>This is not a trivial finding as the change in the saliency of the trace of a stimulus over time could instead have depended on the sensory modality in question <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In general, sustaining any kind of sensory trace is likely costly since it may require sustained neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The finding that fruit flies maintain a "costly" trace of stimuli from different sensory modalities suggests that such ability is highly adaptive.</s></p><p><s>The neural mechanisms underlying visual and olfactory conditioning are surprisingly similar in Drosophila.</s><s>The same set of dopaminergic neurons is sufficient and necessary for signaling electric shock reinforcement to a shared set of mushroom body neurons in both cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>].</s><s>Yet, it is still not known whether the same individual mushroom body intrinsic neurons serve both modalities or if there are dedicated subsets for each modality.</s><s>Moreover, mushroom body neurons were suggested to maintain odor traces in olfactory conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it would be interesting to test whether this is also the case in visual conditioning.</s></p></div>
