see also Supplementary Information).</s><s>We then tested whether SC inactivation induced comparable changes in the cue-related modulation of activity in MT and MST.</s></p><p><s>Neurons were recorded in either area MT or MST while the monkeys performed the task, during the same behavioral sessions documented above.</s><s>The location and direction of motion of the stimuli were based on the tuning properties of the neurons and the size of the motion patch was adjusted to the size of the receptive fields (see Methods).</s><s>Briefly, either the cued or foil stimulus was placed in the receptive field of the neuron under study, and the direction of motion on each trial was set as the preferred or anti-preferred direction of the neuron, and was always opposite in the two stimulus patches.</s><s>We recorded a total of 69 MST (31/38, monkey J/monkey M) and 44 MT (34/10) neurons before inactivation and 77 MST (26/51, monkey J/monkey M) and 55 MT (47/8) neurons during inactivation.</s><s>Some of these neurons were isolated continuously throughout the experiment (MST: n=36 cells, MT: n=18 cells).</s><s>We provide additional analyses for this particular set of neurons in the Supplementary Information.</s></p><p><s>Before SC inactivation, as expected from previous studies demonstrating attention-related modulation of visual responses in MST and MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , we found that neurons recorded in MST (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) and MT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>) exhibited higher discharge rates when the motion stimulus in their receptive field was cued (Cue in, darker lines) than when it was not cued (Cue out, lighter lines).</s><s>As in previous studies, we quantified this modulation by measuring the discharge rate during the delay period of the task (300-800 ms after motion stimuli onset), and computed a Modulation Index, defined as the difference in discharge rates between "cue in" and "cue out" conditions, divided by their sum.</s><s>For the two sample neurons shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the Modulation Indexes were .16</s><s>and .07 for the MST and MT neuron, which correspond to increases in discharge rate of 39% and 15%, respectively.</s></p><p><s>During SC inactivation, this modulation was intact.</s><s>Neurons in MST (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>) and MT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2h</ref>) continued to show higher discharge rates for the motion stimulus in their receptive field when it was cued than when it was not cued.</s><s>The post-injection Modulation Indexes were 0.21 and 0.08 for the MST and MT neuron respectively, which were not significantly different from their pre-injection values, but remained significantly greater than chance (both p&lt;0.0001,</s><s>Wilcoxon rank-sum test "cue in" versus "cue out").</s><s>This cue-related modulation in discharge rate was intact despite the significant decreases in detection performance observed simultaneously during the SC inactivation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, arrows).</s></p><p><s>To quantify the effect of SC inactivation across our population, we measured a Modulation Index for each neuron, before and during inactivation.</s><s>Pre-injection, the average Modulation Index in our sample of neurons was .075±.029 (mean ± 95% ci, median=0.051) in MST and .061±.023 in MT (median=0.048;</s><s>green bars in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>;

0.001), and were not changed by SC inactivation (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, MST: p = 0.30, MT: p = 0.28; Bayesian p(H 0 ): MST: .978,</s><s>MT: .981);</s><s>this result indicates that the ability of an ideal observer to discriminate the cued location was unchanged by SC inactivation.</s></p><p><s>The Fano factor index was significantly less than zero (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) both before (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, MST: p &lt; 0.0001, MT: p =.007) and during inactivation (MST: p &lt; 0.0001, MT: p =.04), and not different from each other (MST p = .66,</s><s>MT p = .23;</s><s>Bayesian p(H 0 ): MST: .988,</s><s>MT: .979);</s><s>this result shows that the variability in discharge rate was reduced by spatial cueing both before and during SC inactivation.</s></p><p><s>The change in inter-neuronal correlation was significantly less than zero (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>) both before (MST: p&lt;0.0001,</s><s>MT: p=0.0001) and during inactivation (MST: p=0.0001,</s><s>MT: p=0.0005), and not different from each other (MST: p=0.76,</s><s>MT: p=0.71;</s><s>Bayesian p(H 0 ): MST: .996,</s><s>MT: .995);</s><s>this result indicates that spatial cues reduced the correlation in activity between neurons, and this reduction was unchanged by SC inactivation.</s><s>Similar findings were made with a wide range of bin sizes used to compute the correlations (Supplementary Information).</s></p><p><s>Finally, we examined cue-related modulations in neuronal activity during other epochs of the task, as well as changes in neuronal activity unrelated to the cue -these were also unchanged during SC inactivation (Supplementary Information).</s><s>We also confirmed that neuronal activity in the parts of MST we recorded were indeed necessary for the performance of the attention task (Supplementary Information).</s></p><p><s>In summary, we found that during SC inactivation, the enhanced responses of neurons in visual cortex to attended stimuli were preserved despite large behavioral impairments in a covert attention task.</s><s>This result was found in two visual areas well-known for their roles in processing motion signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and their modulation by visual attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, the attention deficit induced by SC inactivation not only preserved the cue-related changes in visual responses, it also left intact the other known correlates of attention in visual cortex: the ability of neurons to discriminate cued from uncued spatial locations, the reliability of neuronal discharge (i.e.</s><s>Fano factor), and cue-related changes in noise correlations between neurons.</s><s>These effects cannot be explained by a sensory impairment, because previous studies have shown that attention deficits during SC inactivation are not caused by changes in local motion perception <ref type="bibr">4</ref> .</s><s>The effects also cannot be explained by a motor deficit, because the single-button response in our task was unimpaired for stimuli outside the affected region of the visual field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These findings demonstrate that the known modulations of activity in visual cortex are not the only mechanisms involved in the control of attention and that other processes must play a major role.</s><s>One possibility is that visual attention involves other aspects of neuronal activity in these same visual areas.</s><s>For example, although we found no changes in correlations between nearby neurons, there could be changes between more distant sites or across different areas.</s><s>A second possibility is that the crucial steps take place in other brain areas entirely -for example, in parietal or prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , the SC or basal ganglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>In particular, the frontal eye fields (FEF) exert effects on attention qualitatively similar to the SC <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>However, because of prominent feedback from FEF to visual cortex, SC-induced changes in FEF might have been expected to also change responses in visual cortex.</s><s>Finally, it is possible that distinct circuits mediate different aspects of attention.</s><s>For example, changes in visual cortex might be important for feature-based attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and for regulating the perceptual appearance of stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , whereas the mechanism targeted by SC inactivation is important for the all-or-none aspects of spatial attention (e.g., change-blindness <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> ).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monkey preparation</head><p><s>We performed neuronal recording in MT/MST and reversible inactivation of the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus in two adult rhesus monkeys (subjects F and M) that were 12-16 years of age and weighed 14-16 kg.</s><s>The monkeys were prepared using standard surgical techniques described in detail previously <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</s><s>All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with US Public Health Service policy on the humane care and use of laboratory animals.</s><s>The laboratory setup for behavioral control and monitoring was identical to that described previously <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attentional task</head><p><s>Trials began with the appearance of a central dot that the monkey had to fixate during the whole trial duration.</s><s>Achievement of fixation triggered the display of a peripheral stimulus, the cue, consisting of a 5 to 7 degree-wide patch of static dots.</s><s>The actual size of the patch was chosen as not to exceed the size of the receptive fields of the neurons being recorded.</s><s>On each trial, the cue could be displayed at one of two possible locations, chosen randomly.</s><s>One of these locations was chosen to be in the center of the receptive fields of the recorded neurons and the other one was the symmetric location across the fixation point.</s><s>The cue was displayed for 133 ms and was followed by a 500 ms delay during which only the fixation point was displayed.</s><s>Two patches of moving dots were then displayed at the two previously described locations.</s><s>The dots were moving in opposite direction in the two patches, one of which being the preferred direction of the neurons being recorded.</s><s>The characteristics of the stimulus have been described elsewhere <ref type="bibr">2</ref> .</s><s>In the present case, the dots had an 8-frame lifetime (corresponding to 107 ms).</s><s>The direction of motion of each dot was drawn from a normal distribution centered on the direction of motion of the patch and with a 16° standard deviation.</s><s>The direction of motion of the patches remained constant for 800 ms plus a geometrically distributed delay of mean 480 ms (range: 0-3520 ms).</s><s>This distribution allowed the hazard function to remain flat during the delay.</s><s>Following this delay, the direction of motion of one of the patches changed.</s><s>The monkey had to press a button whenever the change in direction occurred at the previously cued location.</s><s>The change varied from 16° to 20° and was adjusted on the basis of the performance of the monkey at the beginning of each session to keep a global performance of about 75%.</s></p><p><s>Following the beginning of the change in direction, stimuli remained on the screen for 650 ms or until the animal's response.</s><s>Monkeys received a liquid reward only for correct responses in completed trials (button press after change occurred at cued location or absence of response when no change occurred or change occurred at uncued location).</s><s>If the monkey broke fixation midtrial, the trial was aborted and repeated later in the session.</s><s>This paradigm has been referred to as a "filtering" task, because it requires the monkey to actively ignore stimulus changes at the uncued location.</s><s>The advantage of this task design is that correct performance requires the filtering out of signals from irrelevant distracter stimuli.</s><s>This paradigm is similar to that used originally to demonstrate attentional modulation in areas MT and MST <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and more recently to show a causal role of the SC in the control of spatial attention 2 ; it is also similar to that described by Palmer and Moore, 2009 <ref type="bibr">3</ref> .</s></p><p><s>All stimuli were displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT) display with a refresh rate of 75 Hz.</s><s>The background luminance of the monitor was 14 cd m-2.</s><s>Luminance of the fixation dot and of each dot in the patches was 50 cd m-2.</s><s>Subjects pushed buttons mounted on a button box at waist level within easy reach of the left hand.</s><s>Each subject used only its left hand to push buttons.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian analysis</head><p><s>In order to estimate the probability of an absence of difference between the pre-and postinjection data, we computed the Bayes Factor for the comparison between a model assuming a change in mean value during inactivation and a model assuming no change (null hypothesis, or H 0 ).</s><s>When necessary, data was transformed to achieve a normal distribution.</s><s>We computed the Bayes Factor by means of different methods: fractional Bayes factor <ref type="bibr">7</ref> , Bayesian Information Criterion 8 and Bayesian t-test based on the Savage-Dickey ratio test <ref type="bibr">9</ref> .</s><s>These different methods provided comparable results.</s><s>We mention in the main text only the posterior probability of the null hypothesis (p(H 0 )) computed with the fractional Bayes factor method.</s></p></div>
