behavioral states as reflected by the degree of task engagement, and levels of task performance as a function of varying difficulty.</s></p><p><s>Our results show that when subjects are actively performing the task, arousal levels do not influence performance.</s><s>Pupillary dilations also differentiate between correct and error task responses.</s><s>This is hypothesized to reflect a difference in response confidence.</s><s>Additionally, when temporally separating stimulus from response this correct-error dilation difference is already observed in the post-stimulus, but pre-response phase, hence not emanating from licking related motor activity or reward anticipation.</s><s>This phase exhibits a slow and reduced dilation that is maintained until task feedback is provided following which a post-response phase starts that exhibits a marked, large and fast, dilation relative to the pre-response component.</s><s>This second dilation is locked to the response and mainly reflects motor or reward-related components.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavior Procedure and Setup</head><p><s>Mice were trained to perform a vibrotactile 2-AFC task <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mayrhofer et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, upon commencement of training mice were subjected to a water deprivation regime during weekdays, receiving 1 ml of water per training day and water ad libitum during weekends.</s><s>Weight was monitored daily throughout the water deprivation period.</s><s>If a loss of over 20% of body weight was observed compared to the non-deprived weekend days, water was supplemented.</s><s>Mice were handled and acclimatized to the experimenter for 1 week.</s><s>After acclimatization, mice were head-fixed for increasing periods until accepting 1 ml of water while head fixed.</s><s>Once mice attained this stage, they were placed in the setup on a wheel to monitor locomotion and behavioral training on the detection task began.</s><s>In general, for the 2-AFC task mice were required to detect a target stimulus (90 Hz) from two simultaneous bilateral frequencies (for detection distractor was 0 Hz, and later for discrimination 10, 20, 40, or 60 Hz).</s><s>During the discrimination phase, all stimuli were intermixed.</s><s>Whisker stimuli consisted of 1 s long repetitive pulses (singleperiod 120 Hz cosine wave) with a maximum deflection amplitude of 400 µm.</s><s>Stimulation frequency was modulated by changing inter-pulse time intervals.</s><s>Target stimulus was randomly delivered to the left or right C1 whisker, with a piezo bending actuator (Johnson Matthey, Royston, UK) amplified by a piezo controller (MDT693A; Thorlabs, NJ, USA) with mice having to report the side the target was presented on by licking one of two corresponding left or right water spouts placed in front of them (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Lick detection was conducted by capacitive water spouts connected to an Arduino platform (Arduino UNO Rev3; Arduino, Italy).</s><s>Water delivery was controlled by solenoid valves (Bürkert, Ingelfingen, Germany).</s><s>Responses to the task were classified under four categories: correct response with mice being rewarded a water drop delivered through the corresponding spout, error response where no water was rewarded, miss when the animal did not respond with a lick within the decision period window, with no water being rewarded, or a double-lick when mice licked both spouts within a 60 ms period with no water being rewarded.</s><s>The temporal structure of each trial consisted of a 1-s stimulus presented 1.5 s following trials start, with a response window of 2 s after stimulus initiation.</s><s>The inter-trial interval was set as 2 s after the response of the animal or end of decision period with a 50% maximal temporal jitter (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Once mice attained performance of 85% correct responses per session in the detection task, discrimination training commenced.</s><s>For the delayed response detection task waterspout movement was controlled by servo-electric motors (Savöx, Taiwan), following a determined delayed period after stimulus initiation (1,000, 1,500, 2,000 ms).</s><s>This task variant consisted only of detection of the 90 Hz target stimulus.</s><s>For the passive engagement task, highly trained mice (&gt;90% correct responses for detection task) were provided only with a target whisker stimulation (90 Hz), coupled with the automated provision of the reward or in an additional set of experiments provided only with a reward.</s><s>Control of the behavioral sessions and behavioral data analysis was conducted with custom written LabVIEW (National Instruments, RRID:SCR_014325) and MATLAB software (MathWorks, RRID:SCR_001622)</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Locomotion</head><p><s>To monitor for locomotion, mice were placed on a Polystyrene (Styrodur ) wheel, 20 cm diameter, and movement was tracked using an optical incremental encoder (Optical miniature encoder 2400; Kübler, Germany).</s><s>Locomotion was determined as any movement crossing a &gt;5 cm/s threshold during the duration of the trial.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupil Imaging and Detection</head><p><s>Images were acquired using a Point Grey Chameleon3 camera (Point Grey Research) at 30 FPS with a 50 mm lens and the pupil illuminated by an Infrared light-emitting diode (led).</s><s>Throughout the behavioral session, the setup was maintained under constant white light illumination, with the pupil in a dynamic range.</s><s>Pupil movies were recorded separately for each trial (15 frames for baseline).</s></p><p><s>For image acquisition, a custom-written LabVIEW software (National Instruments, RRID:SCR_014325) was used and pupil detection and fitting was conducted offline with customwritten MATLAB software (MathWorks, RRID:SCR_001622).</s><s>For pupil detection, a threshold was determined for each frame and the image converted to a binary image.</s><s>The pupil was detected using a circle fitting algorithm that detects the mean [x, y] coordinates of the pupil in the binary image.</s><s>For determining the validity of the detection, 20% random frames in each movie were visually analyzed by the experimenter.</s><s>The validity criterion was set as &gt;98% fit for all non-blinking frames per session.</s><s>As blinking results in a quick and sudden change in measured pupil size, a threshold for the differential of the pupil transient was used and trials, where blinking was detected, were removed from all subsequent analysis.</s></p></div>

activity, though it remains unclear to what extent pupil dilations in mice represent complex aspects of cognitive function as in humans.</s></p><p><s>In the current study, we show that the pupil is a complex readout system indicative of multiple perceptual phenotypes.</s><s>When in a state of engagement, defined as task responsiveness, large dilations are observed following task-related evidence presentation (stimulation), with larger dilations for correct than error responses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>We were interested in defining the underlying drive for this pupillary representation.</s><s>This difference might arise due to external representations such as reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lee and Margolis, 2016)</ref> or motor-related activity either overt or covert <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Richer et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mineault et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Our analysis indicates that this difference is not related to such external occurrences.</s><s>This is exhibited by several factors.</s><s>There is a lack of correct-error differences in pupil dilation when performance is at chance levels (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>) emanating from an impulsive, non-evidence-based, behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carpenter and Williams, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mayrhofer et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, but contrary to other studies (though see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lu et al., 2020)</ref>, in the current study increases in dilation do not correlate with increased licking (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>) and the increased locomotion during error trials cannot account for increased dilations for correct responses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the correct-error dilation difference does not originate from motor reflected activity emanating from licking or locomotive behavior.</s><s>Furthermore, a reward-driven difference would imply a dilatory difference that is not RT dependent, ruling out also reward as the source of the correcterror difference.</s><s>Taken together, this supports the notion that the dilatory difference emanates from an internal decision component.</s><s>Any coding for a decision component should be represented in the post-stimulus and pre-RT period.</s><s>To test for this, and strengthen our hypothesis, we conducted a delayedresponse task that temporally separates decision components from motor responses.</s><s>Two distinct dilation periods were observed (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A-C</ref>).</s><s>A slow dilation following stimulation, and a second, more pronounced dilation after response.</s><s>This slow pre-reward attainment component cannot be explained by licking behavior as it was our experience that for these highly trained subjects hardly any licking occurred before the presentation of the water spouts.</s><s>While the slow increase in pupil size might represent a latent component of ramping reward anticipation.</s><s>As anticipation in itself cannot explain the correcterror divergence in pupil size as anticipation per se should be modulated by some decisional weight.</s><s>These findings further support possible decision-related effects, as transients already increased and differed in the first, pre-feedback period exhibiting the correct-error difference, without any external input to drive this increase or divergence.</s><s>The second dilation, exhibited following RT, is more likely relating to motor responses or the reward itself.</s></p><p><s>Many decisional components might explain this difference.</s><s>For instance, many pupil studies in humans find a reward prediction error representation (RPE).</s><s>Our results are not in line with this notion.</s><s>RPE would imply increased dilations for errors and a correct-error difference also for early RTs since non-evidence-based prediction should be the same (guessing), while reward outcome differs.</s><s>Potentially, the difference could also emanate from the underlying response vigor or effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Zénon et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>i.e., the willingness of the subject to ''invest'' more mental effort to attain a reward in the face of difficulty.</s><s>Since in this study mice are experts in the task, this could occur due to prior knowledge of lower reward probability outcomes for more difficult trials.</s><s>Alternatively, the pupil might also reflect the actual ''mental effort'' required to solve more difficult trials.</s><s>Effort coding has been related to dopamine, with more vigor related to lower dopamine release <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kurniawan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Walton and Bouret, 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Dopamine release in turn might be reflected by pupil dilations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(de Gee et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Our presented data and analysis do not support vigor coding by the pupil as, under the first interpretation, we would have observed larger pupil dilations for more effort requiring trials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>While under the second assumption, the overall drop in pupil dilations for more difficult trials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>) could be explained by effort coding but it cannot explain the correct-error difference itself as this is manifested irrelevant to task difficulty (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E, 4A-C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Where does this correct-error difference arise from?</s><s>We hypothesize that our results could be interpreted in terms of representation of response confidence, a perception of how confident subjects are in their ensuing response.</s><s>First, confidence coding can explain early RT results, as response confidence would be equal or irrelevant when responses are random and not evidence-based.</s><s>Second, the correct-error difference is observed only when responses are stimulus-based, with dilation transients continuing to increase with increased RT (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>It would be appropriate for a notion like response confidence to be maintained within an underlying network until RT, awaiting choice feedback.</s><s>For highly trained animals, responses leading to a correct outcome would be presumed to be accompanied by higher choice confidence due to prior experience.</s><s>Third, response confidence can also explain the differences in dilations with respect to task difficulty.</s><s>Higher response confidence being exhibited as larger dilation for easier tasks but dropping with increased difficulty and the correct-error difference ultimately converging at chance level performance when based on guessing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>Fourth, in support of confidence coding, a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lak et al., 2017</ref>) linked response confidence with the dopaminergic system.</s><s>Indeed, LC modulates dopaminergic activity in both Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and Substantia Nigra <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Grenhoff et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zhu, 2018)</ref> and VTA afferents innervate LC <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ornstein et al., 1987)</ref>.</s><s>While this study did not address pupil dilations it is conceivable that the dopaminergic system reflects confidence through dilations either driven by LC activation of dopaminergic loci or prefrontal cortex feedback arising from these interconnected systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arnsten and Goldman-Rakic, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sara and Hervé-Minvielle, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jodo et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>When taken together these results support our hypothesis that the decisional variable observed through the correct-error dilation difference relates to response confidence.</s></p><p><s>Pupil studies in mice, mainly studied pupil size in correlation with arousal levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Murphy et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Reimer et al., 2014)</ref> indicated through locomotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mineault et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shimaoka et al., 2018)</ref> or surprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Vinck et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Further, arousal levels influence performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(McGinley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Schriver et al., 2018)</ref> manifested as a U-shaped relationship between the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Murphy et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Though, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kahneman and Beatty (1967)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beatty (1982a)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Karatekin et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Neske et al. (2019)</ref>.</s><s>In the current study, under task performance, baseline pupil size is not directly an arousal marker but rather indicates engagement.</s><s>Overall, when subjects are disengaged, pre-stimulus pupil size is not overtly coding task-relevant information (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) and not relating to performance levels for more difficult trials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>This shows that for the current task if baseline pupil size is taken as a proxy of arousal, arousal levels do not affect performance.</s><s>This is in discrepancy with previous results <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(McGinley et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This could be explained by different task modalities being used <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(McGinley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Neske et al., 2019)</ref>, different cognitive requirements imposed by the 2-AFC task and Go/noGo or detection tasks response categorization, where perceptual failure or lack of motivation are less distinguishable or lighting conditions in the experiment.</s><s>Under low light conditions used in previous studies, pupil size might be mainly influenced by sympathetic input.</s><s>However, parasympathetic input would dominate in the ambient light condition used in the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Steinhauer et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, we conclude that under the described task conditions baseline pupil size, holds no information for perceptually relevant task processing.</s><s>Pre-stimulus pupil size reflects engagement or disengagement states, not a general state of arousal.</s></p><p><s>The behavioral state or task demands, based on what various, underlying neuronal mechanisms are directed towards, may well influence pupil diameter.</s><s>As such, the stimulus-reward association was altered by decoupling the stimulus detection requirement from reward attainment.</s><s>A condition we refer to as passive performance.</s><s>Under these conditions, dilations were smaller compared to correct responses under active performance, even though stimulus and reward presentation were the same (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>Under passive performance, when both reward and stimulation were presented, dilation was increased compared to when only the reward was presented, indicating that under passive performance both reward and stimulus are reflected by the pupil.</s><s>Thus, when actively performing the task, pupil dilations have a dominating component of internal decision variables, while under passive performance external occurrences dominate the dilation and despite a lack of cognitive requirement to attend to the task, these passive behavioral states differ from complete disengagement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>These observations may relate to the LC adaptive gain theory and the explorationexploitation modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aston-Jones et al., 1994</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Usher et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Clayton et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, when the stimulus has no task function, but there exists a requirement to drive attention to external occurrences (such as potential reward) internal states quickly fluctuate from an exploitative mode, reflected by low baseline and pupillary reactivity to relevant occurrences, to an explorative mode where task occurrences are not coded, exhibited by increased baseline and low pupillary reactivity to the occurrence with baseline pupil size reflecting task attentiveness rather than mere arousal.</s><s>Thus, the behavioral state and requirements posed by the environment are determining what the pupil reflects.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our results provide further evidence for the complexity of what pupillary dilations reflect and support findings related to the LC-NE adaptive gain theory.</s><s>When actively performing the task, these dilations provide evidence for a representation of response confidence.</s><s>Also, baseline pupil size reflects states of task engagement and attentiveness rather than general arousal.</s><s>Finally, in a state of passive behavior, pupillary dilations reflect external occurrences with smaller pupil dilation relative to active performance due to the lack of task-related decisional variables.</s><s>The presented paradigm combined with pupillometry provides a framework to relate behavioral states with large scale neuronal network dynamics recorded using multielectrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jun et al., 2017)</ref> or two-photon imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Margolis et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stirman et al., 2016)</ref> techniques during perceptual decision making
