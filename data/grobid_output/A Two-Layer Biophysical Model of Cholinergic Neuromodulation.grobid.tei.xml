just as nicotinic activation does in the glomerular layer, but with two key differences: (1) it operates with respect to a spike precedence code rather than a rate code metric, delaying spikes rather than suppressing them, and (2) the topology of the space within which EPL decorrelation acts is not the same as that of the glomerular layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fantana et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kim et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>That is, there is no reason that the pattern of functional lateral inhibitory weights should reflect the similarity of OSN receptive fields as measured within any one particular statistical odor environment.</s><s>Rather, it has been hypothesized that decorrelation in this layer reflects olfactory learning, altering the behavioral discrimination of similar odorants based on individual experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cleland et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cleland, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>These simulations also illustrate how nicotinic and muscarinic effects can synergize with one another, exerting complementary effects that seem to compensate for the other's weaknesses and produce a more robust effect than either subtype would evoke separately.</s><s>For example, nicotinic neuromodulation increases contrast enhancement, but slightly reduces the efficacy of EPL inhibition.</s><s>With low GC excitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cang and Isaacson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pressler et al., 2007)</ref>, multiple presynaptic MC spikes within a narrow time window are needed to evoke GC activity sufficient to effectively influence spike timing in follower MCs.</s><s>With muscarinic coactivation, the increased synchrony among MC spikes renders them more effective at inducing substantive GC responses, and the increase in GC excitability sharpens the phase restriction of MC spikes while retaining the narrower activity profile generated by nicotinic neuromodulation.</s><s>The coordinated activation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors seems to best regulate the degree of sharpening of odor representations in both computational layers of the OB and with respect to both spike rate and spike timing metrics.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
