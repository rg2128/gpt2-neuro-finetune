<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Similar odors evoke correlated input patterns to the OB</head><p><s>To test how efficiently the olfactory system may separate similar odor-evoked representations, we aimed at generating a large set of odorant stimuli evoking input patterns that vary in similarity.</s><s>We investigated the complex representation of OB sensory inputs by imaging odor-evoked Ca 2+ responses in the glomerular layer of awake head-restrained transgenic mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3 in olfactory sensory neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> (OSNs, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>We used two groups of binary mixtures -amyl acetate/ethyl butyrate (AA/EB) and ethyl butyrate/3-hexanone (EB/HX)composed of variable relative ratios of individual components mixed either in gaseous or liquid phases.</s><s>The gaseous and liquid mixtures having the same presumed ratios differed consistently and could be attributed to the chemical properties of resulting mixtures such as relative composition and total concentration.</s><s>This was highlighted by the analytical studies of binary mixtures using gas chromatography combined to flame ionization detection (GC-FID, see methods and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; total FID area concentrations ranged from ~1000 to 10000).</s><s>Nevertheless, related mixtures evoked similar spatiotemporal patterns of glomerular activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>To quantify the similarity, we combined the fluorescence change of activated glomeruli in a population vector binned over an entire breath and further computed the Pearson correlation coefficient between vectors of activity evoked by each mixture, either for each mouse or for all animals (yielding similar results; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>The systematic comparison of all possible mixtures to each other was reported in a correlation matrix which revealed that binary mixtures with identical components at different ratios (either AA/EB or EB/HX mixtures) evoked highly correlated patterns of activity, whereas binary mixtures with different components (AA/EB vs. EB/HX mixtures) evoked less correlated patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>-e and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>).</s><s>This observation was consistent throughout the time course of the first breath following odor presentation onset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>-f and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Importantly, input correlation was not correlated to the amplitude of glomerular responses (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the odorant concentration used is the study did not saturate OSN response (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s><s>Finally, input correlation across mixtures was similar for weakly and strongly activated glomeruli (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>), indicating that strong glomerular responses do not impose the level of input correlation.</s><s>The differences between input representations are therefore neither due to saturation of the calcium dye nor due to strongly and potentially saturating OSN responses, which may have both compressed the dynamic range of the calcium imaging readout.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, these data suggest that binary mixtures sharing the same pre-determined component ratios evoke highly correlated input patterns to the OB, irrespective of the subtle differences caused by gaseous and liquid phase mixing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OB reformatting of odor representations in a single breath</head><p><s>Despite similarities between odorant-evoked input patterns, trained rodents can discriminate monomolecular odorants or mixtures in less than 400 ms, which corresponds to the duration of one or two breaths <ref type="bibr">14,18─20,25─27</ref> .</s><s>The olfactory bulb network may thus process sensory inputs in order to separate overlapping information.</s><s>To test this assumption, single M/T cell units (n = 377 cells from 18 mice) were recorded in the OB of awake head-restrained mice while presenting various odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>).</s><s>Neurons displayed complex responses to odorants such as phasic, tonic, excitatory, inhibitory or bimodal (n = 1248 odor-cell pairs in 6 mice, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>-e and n = 1859 and 1430 odor-cell pairs in 4 and 8 mice, respectively, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a-d</ref>; different datasets were used to ascertain the reproducibility of population correlation in different animal groups).</s><s>In order to compare the similarity of output patterns evoked by different mixtures, we computed the Pearson correlation between population vectors of M/T cell activity averaged over the first breath duration after odor onset evoked by different mixtures.</s><s>Notably, the output correlation matrix differed from the one computed at the input level, suggesting that sensory representations are indeed reformatted within the OB synaptic pathway (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>,g to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Some groups of mixtures that were correlated at the input level became decorrelated at the output level whereas others remained unchanged (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2g</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>).</s><s>Though there was an overall reduction of output correlation, few mixtures evoked more correlated patterns at the output level than at the input level (points above the diagonal in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2h</ref>), suggesting a nonlinear reduction of input to output correlations over all odors.</s></p><p><s>We then analyzed the output correlation at a finer time scale.</s><s>Interestingly, the level of correlation between output patterns significantly evolved over the time course of the first and subsequent breaths, groups of mixtures becoming significantly decorrelated over time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>,b, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e</ref>-h and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>).</s><s>For some mixtures, decorrelation was rapid (e.g.</s><s>red and blue curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>,c and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), which is consistent with some mitral cells responding to the early glomerular response (i.e.</s><s>first 80ms in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, correlation was increasing in the first 120 ms and then decreasing in the remaining part of the breath for other mixtures (e.g.</s><s>cyan and magenta curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>,c and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>), which likely relates to the increase of input correlation seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, a significant decorrelation was observed for all subgroups of mixtures during the first breath (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>).</s><s>A similar decorrelation was observed after subtracting baseline firing activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>), indicating that the process is independent from sniff-related baseline dynamics and from non-responding cells.</s><s>Since input correlation reached a maximum around 120 ms, we further analyzed the output correlation from this time point of the first breath.</s><s>We observed a significant decorrelation process taking place between 126 and 252 ms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, increasing the temporal resolution by averaging mitral/tufted firing over a 21 ms time window revealed that output patterns were significantly decorrelated in ~80─100 ms after the peak of input correlation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7a</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly differences in the population firing rate evoked by different mixtures could not explain the observed correlation differences (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore the extent and dynamics of pattern correlation for different groups of mixtures depended neither on cell sampling nor on single cell response property since similar correlation behavior was observed for independently recorded datasets for which neurons displayed dissimilar response profiles (compare Figs. 2,3 and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>).</s><s>The main differences of correlation observed for different mixtures might instead be due to the variation of component concentration and absolute number of molecules in the mixtures, as reported by our GC-FID analysis (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and see methods).</s><s>Taken together, these results suggest that a reformatting of activity occurs in the OB, which tends to increase the separation of representations evoked by similar mixtures over a breathing cycle.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Output pattern similarity predicts learning performances</head><p><s>Does pattern separation taking place over the time course of a breath help animals to discriminate related odorants in a behavioral task?</s><s>To address this question, we trained mice on a head-restrained go/no-go operant discrimination paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and tested eleven pairs of odorants that we selected based on the amount of output correlation they elicited (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>While the extent of input correlation over the first post-odor breath was not a good predictor of discrimination performances, we observed in contrast a significant correlation between M/T ensemble correlation and discrimination performances during the initial learning phase, defined here as the average of the first 300 trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c─e</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were observed when considering the mean and the minimum of the output correlation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>) or when output correlation was quantified only after the maximum of input correlation had been reached (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7b─e</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that the extent of pattern separation in the OB predicts the ability of mice to discriminate between two odorants: the more the patterns are separated; the faster the odor discrimination learning takes place.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GABA neurons modulate pattern separation and learning</head><p><s>To further test the causal relationship between pattern separation and odor discriminability, we aimed to manipulate the OB outputs using optogenetics.</s><s>Theoretical works suggest that pattern decorrelation may depend on OB inhibitory interneurons <ref type="bibr">23,30─32</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we expressed channelrhodopsin2-YFP (ChR2) in interneurons of the granule cell layer using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Immunohistochemical analysis of the infected brains revealed an infection exclusively restricted to the GCL in which ~35% of the neurons were transfected (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>We further performed extracellular recordings of M/T cells using optrodes (n = 38 cells from 6 mice; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Photostimulation significantly inhibited 38% of the total odor-M/T cell pairs (n = 228, χ 2 test, P = 0.01).</s><s>Light-evoked inhibition was cell-specific and M/T cell responses evoked by each odorant were not linearly inhibited (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results suggest that the photostimulation triggered a specific modulation of tuning properties rather than an unspecific gain control.</s><s>Though the average population rate was significantly reduced by light stimulation either during air or odor presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6g</ref>), photostimulation enhanced pattern decorrelation over the breath time course only during the odor epoch for mixtures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6h</ref>).</s><s>The light-induced decorrelation was visible across the breathing cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6i</ref>).</s><s>In summary, photoactivation of inhibitory neurons in the GC layer modulates individual M/T cells activity and promotes pattern decorrelation.</s></p><p><s>Considering our observations that the extent of pattern separation correlates with odordiscrimination learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>), one would expect that enhancement of decorrelation should improve odor-discrimination performance.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we trained two cohorts of mice (expressing either enhanced green fluorescence protein [EGFP] or ChR2-YFP in neurons of the granule cell layer) on different mixture discrimination tasks.</s><s>Head-restrained mice were photostimulated using a LED implanted on a cranial window overlaying both olfactory bulbs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6j</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>,b and see methods).</s><s>At high light power, animals strongly reduced their licking behavior in an olfactory association task (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>), suggesting a global silencing of M/T cells.</s><s>In order to avoid such effect, we gradually reduced the light power until complete recovery of the normal licking behavior.</s><s>This optimized power was then used during odor discrimination tasks.</s><s>ChR2expressing mice learned mixture discriminations faster than control mice but reached similar final performance levels (AA/EB and EB/HX mixtures in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6k</ref>).</s><s>This effect was specific to photostimulation since the discrimination performance evolved similarly in both cohorts when two other mixtures were subsequently tested in the absence of light stimulation (C+/C -and AC/LI mixtures in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6k</ref>).</s><s>Then, in order to reconfirm the photostimulation effect, we trained the same mice on yet another binary mixture pair.</s><s>Again, light stimulation significantly enhanced learning performances without altering the final performance levels in the ChR2-expressing mice (HO/HA mixtures in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6k</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next questioned whether stimulating GCL neurons would have similar impact on simple odor discrimination tasks.</s><s>Interestingly M/T cell correlation for the monomolecular compounds present in the mixtures was not affected by ChR2 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10a</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the electrophysiology, ChR2 stimulation did not affect the learning pace for simple odor discrimination task in an additional cohort of mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, but consistent with our first cohort, learning pace for difficult discrimination tasks (mixtures) was improved by photostimulation of GCL neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10c</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, photostimulation specifically enhanced reaction times for difficult discrimination tasks (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10d</ref>).</s><s>These results confirm that pattern separation is a process mainly required to disambiguate overlapping OSN inputs representation.</s></p><p><s>We finally tested whether inhibiting GCL neurons would have an opposite effect on pattern separation and odor discrimination learning.</s><s>We thus tested the effect of silencing the GCL population using inhibitory pharmacogenetic manipulation (hM4Di Gi-DREADD cohort).</s><s>We recorded odor-evoked responses of M/T cells before and after DREADD activation by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) injection.</s><s>CNO injection increased odor-evoked firing rates in DREADD infected mice but not in ChR2 expressing mice (used as controls, Fig. <ref type="figure"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Our work provides evidence that overlapping glomerular maps evoked by related odorants can be separated by the OB network (up to certain level of similarity).</s><s>This neural reformatting, which occurs during a single sniff, helps to disambiguate similar odorants and improves odorant discrimination learning.</s><s>Finally, pattern separation can be promoted by the interplay between M/T cells and GABAergic neurons.</s></p><p><s>Overlapping OSN inputs can be decorrelated into separated patterns of M/T cell activity in a single breath (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s><s>Though we observed an overall decrease of correlation between input and output patterns, some mixtures evoked output patterns that remained highly correlated or even exhibited an increase of correlation compared to input patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>).</s><s>We do not think that the input/output transformation can simply be explained by the use of different recording techniques.</s><s>Indeed, though the differences in sensitivity and temporal resolution between the two techniques may limit the direct comparison of correlation at 40 ms time scale, such limitations are no longer valid when the patterns of activity are averaged and compared over the complete breath duration.</s><s>Furthermore, higher correlation observed at the input level for some mixtures cannot be explained by overestimated correlation resulting from possible calcium dye saturation for strongly activated glomeruli (Supplementary Figs.</s><s>2─4).</s><s>In conclusion, odorant stimuli undergo an input/output reformatting in the OB involving a nonlinear reduction of correlation.</s></p><p><s>While in the past several groups have analyzed coding properties in the rodent olfactory bulb, the existence of pattern separation was often eluded, probably because of the use of a limited number of related odorant stimuli or the absence of neuronal population analyses.</s><s>Yet, some authors questioned the role of OB (in comparison to the PC) to compute pattern separation using odor blends <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>They reported a drop of correlation when comparing acrosstrials correlation vs. across-mixtures correlation, which in fact does not correspond to a pattern separation process.</s><s>In addition, they did not observe any significant decorrelation between similar mixtures.</s><s>In contrast, here we show that decorrelation of similar mixtures occurred in the OB with temporal dynamics that varied for different subgroups of mixtures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>), probably reflecting temporal patterning of M/T cell spiking <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Strikingly, decorrelation occurs in 80-100 ms after the peak of input correlation within the first breath after odor onset, providing a relevant timescale for the reaction time measured during olfactory-driven behaviors 14,25─27 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In both insects and vertebrates, the anatomical segregation of glomeruli constitutes the first step to differentiate channels of information and help animals to discriminate between odorants.</s><s>Though discrimination behavior can be predicted to some extent by the similarity of glomerular responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , this prediction is not efficient at the early learning phase of novel odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Here using a large set of mixtures varying in similarity, we could confirm that glomerular input correlation is not a good predictor of discrimination learning for novel odorants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, initial behavioral performances were clearly predicted by the output correlation during the complete breath (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the fast decorrelation process taking place following the peak of input correlation also significantly predicts behavioral performances (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>).</s><s>These results support the idea that overlapping activity patterns are separated at the level of the OB network.</s><s>Importantly, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulations of the OB network further support this view (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>).</s><s>It is noteworthy that learning performances for simple odorants were not affected by optogenetic manipulations in contrast to the learning of mixtures (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref>).</s><s>In conclusion, while very different glomerular patterns would not require further separation in the OB network, as observed in the case of monomolecular odorants (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref>), our results emphasize the functional relevance of OBmediated pattern separation in processing similar

modelling studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> for a long time but never demonstrated, our work provide evidence for a functional role of pattern separation at a pre-cortical level.</s></p><p><s>Using optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulations, we provide evidence that the interplay between M/T cells and GCL neurons affects pattern separation (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the odor specificity of evoked inputs matters since ChR2-mediated GC recruitment does not linearly reduce the tuning curve of M/T cells but rather changes its shape (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that GC layer photostimulation preferentially changes the odor selectivity rather than the gain, in contrast to other GABAergic interneurons such as such as parvalbumin cells of the external plexiform layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Consistent with our observations, computational and in vitro works speculated that GCdependent gating of M/T cells should enhance channel decorrelation, reduce spiking similarities between pairs of M/T cells and further improve pattern separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Supported by recent in vivo work, other models speculated in contrast that periglomerular cells (PG) may reduce similarity between odor-evoked M/T cells representations through non-topographical contrast enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>GC would hence preferentially modulate fast gamma oscillations without substantial change of M/T cells firing rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>However, our optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulations of GCL neurons contrasts with this idea, showing that those neurons can in fact enhance contrast between related odorants.</s><s>As channel decorrelation or non-topographical contrast enhancement can occur separately from pattern separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> , it is possible that they constitute different or complementary processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, future work will be needed to test the possible contribution of other subpopulations of OB interneurons <ref

such as intrinsic biophysical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> of M/T cells to pattern separation.</s></p><p><s>How the GC to M/T cell inhibition is recruited is critical for the control of olfactory discrimination behavior.</s><s>Indeed, the deletion of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 in GCs, while boosting synaptic Ca 2+ influx and thus M/T cell dendrodendritic inhibition, does not change odor discrimination learning pace <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In the present work, ChR2-GC layer photostimulation may force a more global, but still specific, GABA release mimicking an increase of synaptic weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , favoring pattern decorrelation and improving the learning pace.</s><s>The ChR2 condition might relate to M/T cells inhibition induced by cortical feedback projections onto granule cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s></p><p><s>What is the relevance of pattern separation for downstream networks?</s><s>In the recorded neuronal population, pattern separation is mainly processed by M/T cells responding with temporal changes of firing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>), possibly enhancing fine temporal differences between overlapping odor-evoked patterns.</s><s>As the PC is able to integrate temporally shifted OB outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> , pattern separation may broaden the range of PC neurons that are sensitive to different temporal integration windows.</s></p><p><s>While our data showed that pattern separation occurs in the OB, a previous work indicates that this process occurs downstream, in the PC <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>It is possible that, after an extensive training, the PC separates patterns of activity evoked by similar stimuli that the OB fails to segregate <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Alternatively, the PC may preferentially process pattern completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, the PC, like the hippocampus, is an

comparably reduce correlated inputs to the PC and CA3 respectively in order to prevent misclassification of patterns and facilitate memory formation.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, pattern separation might constitute an efficient network feature shared by different brain structures to properly identify stimuli eliciting a combinatorial of overlapping inputs and thereby promoting better
