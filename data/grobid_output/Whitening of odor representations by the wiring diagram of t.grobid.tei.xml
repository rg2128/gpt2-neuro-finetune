p = 0.003, F-test; t 1 was slightly shifted relative to the time window for correlation analysis to cover the peak of the variance).</s><s>Hence, MC activity patterns in the larval OB became decorrelated and contrast-normalized, consistent with the whitening of odor representations in the adult OB.</s></p><p><s>Whitening can facilitate pattern classification but may also introduce noise.</s><s>We therefore quantifed the reliability of odor classification using a template matching procedure based on single-trial responses and found that classification success, as well as the separation of correct and incorrect classifications, were slightly higher at t 2 than at t 1 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3</ref>).</s><s>Hence, pattern decorrelation did not compromise the reliability of odor identification by a simple classifier but facilitated pattern separation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational consequences of connectivity</head><p><s>While contrast normalization can be achieved by global scaling operations such as divisive normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , pattern decorrelation requires interactions between distinct subsets of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>In theory, pattern decorrelation could be achieved by large networks with sparse and random connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> but this architecture is inconsistent with the low number of INs in the larval OB.</s><s>Smaller networks can decorrelate specific input patterns when their connectivity is adapted to the covariance structure of these inputs, suggesting that decorrelation in the OB is an input-specific transformation of odor representations that is encoded in the wiring diagram.</s><s>In order to explore this hypothesis we first asked whether whitening can be reproduced by implementing the wiring diagram in a network of minimally complex single-neuron models (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We first simulated a network of threshold-linear rate neurons with 208 MCs, representing all recorded MCs with input and output synapses, and 234 INs, representing all connected INs.</s><s>Connections between individual neurons were given by the wiring diagram.</s><s>Excitatory sensory input into MCs was defined by the odor-evoked activity pattern at t 1 .</s><s>INs received no sensory input because synapses from sensory neurons onto INs were rare (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1a</ref>).</s><s>All connections made by neurons of the same type (MC or IN) had the same weight scaling.</s><s>The time course of stimuli consisted of a fast initial rise followed by a slow decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , approximating the response time course of olfactory sensory neurons in zebrafish <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Because connectivity was fixed, the final network model had only six degrees of freedom (thresholds, synaptic weight scaling factors and time constants of each neuron type).</s></p><p><s>Correlations between simulated population responses to bile acids increased rapidly and subsequently decreased.</s><s>Consistent with experimental observations, the mean correlation decreased significantly between two time windows t 1 and t 2 that were chosen so that the mean activity was not significantly different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3b</ref>).</s><s>The variance (contrast) of activity patterns and its standard deviation across stimuli peaked slightly later than the correlation and decreased thereafter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3b</ref>).</s><s>Correlations between IN activity patterns remained higher than correlations between MC activity patterns throughout the odor response (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4a</ref>).</s><s>Hence, simulation results were in good agreement with experimental observations.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3b</ref>).</s><s>IN-IN connectivity was therefore omitted in further simulations for simplicity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To exclude the possibility that pattern decorrelation by simulated networks reflects a chaotic process we examined responses to inputs with biologically realistic amounts of noise (Methods).</s><s>While activity patterns representing different odors became decorrelated, correlations between noisy representations of the same stimuli remained high (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4b</ref>), demonstrating that pattern decorrelation did not reflect an amplification of noise.</s></p><p><s>Randomizing the wiring diagram by independent shufflings of the feed-forward connectivity matrix W MC→IN and the feedback connectivity matrix W MC←IN abolished pattern decorrelation and contrast normalization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Hence, whitening depended on the wiring diagram.</s><s>To corroborate this conclusion we examined whether the reorganization of activity patterns underlying whitening can be predicted from connectivity without an explicit simulation of network dynamics.</s><s>Activity patterns at t 1 were multiplied with the feedforward connectivity W MC→IN , normalized, and thresholded to generate a hypothetical pattern of IN activity.</s><s>This activity pattern was then multiplied with the feed-back connectivity W MC←IN to predict the pattern of feedback inhibition onto MCs.</s><s>The feedback pattern was either subtracted from the MC activity at t 1 (subtractive inhibition), or the MC activity pattern at t 1 was divided by the pattern of feedback inhibition neuron-by-neuron (divisive inhibition; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">5a</ref>).</s><s>This simple algebraic procedure reproduced both pattern decorrelation and variance normalization, independent of whether inhibition was subtractive or divisive (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">5b</ref>).</s><s>Whitening was again abolished when connectivity matrices were randomized.</s><s>These results confirm that the wiring diagram contains information essential for whitening.</s></p><p><s>We next performed more specific manipulations to explore how whitening depends on higher-order structure in the wiring diagram.</s><s>In simulations without IN-IN connections, we first applied the same shufflings to MC→IN connections (W MC→IN ) and to MC←IN connectivity (W MC←IN ).</s><s>This co-permutation of feed-forward and feedback connectivity shuffles the off-diagonal elements in the disynaptic connectivity matrix (lateral inhibition) but preserves the overall distribution of disynaptic MC→IN→MC connection strengths and the on-diagonal elements (self-inhibition; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3f</ref>).</s><s>Similar to the independent randomization of W MC→IN and W MC←IN , co-permutation of W MC→IN and W MC←IN abolished whitening (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, whitening was abolished when input channels were permuted to produce novel input patterns with the same statistical properties and correlations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3e</ref>).</s><s>These results show that whitening is mediated by higher-order features of multisynaptic connectivity that are adapted to patterns of sensory input.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Higher-order structure of connectivity</head><p><s>The shortest synaptic path between two MCs associated with different glomeruli is a disynaptic interaction via one IN (MC-IN-MC).</s><s>To identify properties of the wiring diagram that mediate whitening we therefore analyzed MC-IN-MC triplets.</s><s>There are seven possible triplet configurations that represent four topological motifs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4a</ref>).</s><s>We found that the motif containing no reciprocal connection (motif 1) was underrepresented whereas the other motifs were overrepresented in comparison to randomized networks (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4b</ref>).</s><s>The strongest overrepresentation was observed for motif 4, which contains reciprocal connections between both MCs and the IN.</s><s>Hence, MC-IN-MC triplets frequently contained reciprocal connections.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether disynaptic connectivity between MCs depends on their tuning we constructed an input tuning curve for each MC from the responses to the eight odors at t 1 .</s></p><p><s>We then quantified the Pearson correlation between the input tuning curves of MC pairs and the number of disynaptic MC-IN-MC connection paths across all motifs.</s><s>The mean number of disynaptic connections increased with the input tuning correlation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4c</ref>, left).</s><s>MCs with similar tuning were more likely to be connected through motifs with reciprocal connections, particularly motifs 2 and 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4d</ref>; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with this observation, the correlation between tuning similarity and disynaptic connectivity of MC pairs remained strong when only reciprocal connections were considered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4c</ref>, right).</s><s>Hence, triplets mediate interactions preferentially between MCs with similar tuning, and these interactions frequently contain reciprocal connections.</s></p><p><s>As for MC-IN-MC connections, motifs with one or two reciprocal connections were also overrepresented in IN-MC-IN triplets but no simple relationship was apparent between input tuning and disynaptic IN-MC-IN connectivity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-c</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we found that the tuning of synaptic inputs and outputs of individual INs was significantly correlated and that large sets of fully reciprocally connected neurons ("maximal cliques") were strongly overrepresented in the wiring diagram (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7d-g</ref>).</s><s>These observations further demonstrate that the connectivity among OB neurons is not random but governed, at least in part, by functional response properties.</s></p></div>

contrast, inhibition does not amplify asymmetries in inputs and self-inhibition is usually stronger than lateral inhibition (assuming equal synaptic strength; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">right</ref>).</s><s>Hence, reciprocal triplet connectivity should primarily down-regulate, rather than sharpen, the activity of neurons in connected cohorts.</s><s>As illustrated in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, computational effects of contrast enhancement (by unidirectional connectivity) or suppression of cohorts

MC cohorts that dominated the initial pattern correlations.</s><s>MCs with high r i,t1 also made strong contributions to pattern variance at t 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">5c</ref>) because their activity was substantially higher than the population mean.</s><s>Because the selective inhibition of these cohorts between t 1 and t 2 changed the activity of these MCs towards the population mean, the inhibition of these MCs also decreased pattern variance and its s.d.</s><s>across odors.</s><s>Pattern decorrelation and contrast normalization can therefore be attributed to a common mechanism that targets inhibition to specific MC cohorts and results in contrast reduction rather than contrast enhancement.</s></p><p><s>The selective suppression of activity in cohorts of co-responsive MCs cannot be achieved by global changes in subtractive or divisive inhibition because inhibition within cohorts needs to be stronger than the mean inhibition across the population in response to defined sets of odors.</s><s>To explore how such stimulus-and ensemble-specific inhibition is generated by specific wiring we defined functional cohorts of MCs for each pair of bile acid stimuli as the 10 MCs with the highest r i,t1 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>).</s><s>We then determined the disynaptic MC inputs to these cohorts by retrograde tracing through the wiring diagram across two synapses.</s><s>Inputs to MCs within a cohort were strongly biased towards MCs of the same cohort (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">5d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with this finding, the density of MC-IN-MC triplets, particularly motifs 2 and 4, was significantly higher within cohorts than among randomly chosen MC subsets (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>).</s><s>Hence, cohorts of MCs are not only functional ensembles defined by similar initial responses but also anatomical ensembles with a high density of disynaptic MC-IN-MC connections.</s></p><p><s>The dense disynaptic connectivity implies that MCs in a cohort will be strongly inhibited when the cohort is activated as a whole.</s><s>Indeed, the activity of MC and the associated presynaptic INs in a cohort evolved in opposite directions during an odor response (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9c</ref>).</s><s>As a consequence of cohort-specific connectivity, inhibition of MCs within a cohort will be stronger than the mean level of inhibition.</s><s>The specific suppression of activity underlying whitening can thus be attributed to dense reciprocal connectivity within cohorts that are activated by specific sets of odors.</s><s>Cohorts therefore function as "feature detectors", where a "feature" is a molecular stimulus property that efficiently activates many MCs in the ensemble.</s><s>When a feature is present, the activity of the corresponding MC cohort is down-regulated by feedback inhibition and the representation of the feature in population activity patterns is suppressed, which reduces correlations between related patterns.</s><s>Pattern decorrelation can therefore be explained by a mechanism that involves "feature suppression" through specific connectivity.</s><s>Features may correspond to functional groups that promote high correlations of afferent activity patterns because they activate overlapping sets of odorant receptors.</s><s>This hypothesis predicts that MCs within functional cohorts exhibit similar input tuning to suppress the representation of such features.</s><s>Indeed, the mean correlation between tuning curves of MCs at t 1 was significantly higher within cohorts (r = 0.56 ± 0.40; mean ± s.d.) than across all MCs (r = 0.01 ± 0.38; p &lt; 10 -84 ; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</s></p><p><s>Feature suppression decreases pattern correlations by the selective inhibition of MCs with high activity and large contributions to initial correlations.</s><s>To confirm that this mechanism can account for whitening in the OB we set the activity of MCs in functional cohorts (10 MCs with the highest r i,t1 pair at t 1 ) to the population mean for each odor pair.</s><s>As predicted, this "targeted suppression" of functional cohorts resulted in decorrelation and variance normalization (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">5b</ref>).</s><s>To further dissect the mechanism of feature suppression we took advantage of simulations.</s><s>We first ranked simulated MCs by their r i,t1</s></p><p><s>for bile acid-evoked activity patterns in experiments (same ranking as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">5c</ref>).</s><s>As observed experimentally, simulated MCs with large r i,t1 were strongly inhibited between t 1 and t 2 while the mean activity of other MCs remained unchanged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6a</ref>).</s><s>Direct analysis of inhibitory inputs to individual MCs confirmed that MCs with large r i,t1 received substantially more inhibition than other MCs.</s><s>This specific targeting of inhibition to MCs with large r i,t1 was abolished when connectivity was randomized (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6b</ref>).</s><s>Simulations therefore precisely reproduced the activity changes in individual neurons that resulted in whitening, implying that simulations recapitulated the underlying mechanism.</s><s>Moreover, these results further show that decorrelation and whitening of inputs cannot be achieved by global inhibition but rely on interactions among specific subsets of neurons.</s></p><p><s>We next performed selective manipulations of the wiring diagram.</s><s>We first selected the MCs with the highest r i,t1 for each pair of bile acid stimuli (MC cohorts; 19 MCs in total; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>) and deleted their connections onto INs (11% of all MC→IN connections; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6c</ref>, "selective deletion").</s><s>As a control, we deleted the same fraction of feedforward connections of random subsets of MCs.</s><s>While random deletions had almost no effect, the selective deletion of feed-forward connections from MC cohorts abolished pattern decorrelation and variance normalization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Ranking of MCs by their r i,t1 in experimental data demonstrated that the activity of MCs with high r i,t1 was not substantially reduced between t 1 and t 2 when MC→IN connections originating from cohorts were deleted.</s><s>As a consequence, these MCs continued to make large positive contributions to pattern correlation and variance at t 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6f</ref>).</s><s>The selective deletion of MC→IN connections from functional cohorts therefore abolished whitening because it disrupted feature suppression.</s><s>To corroborate this result we redirected feed-forward connections of MCs within cohorts to randomly selected IN targets, which perturbs the connectivity of cohorts without changing the total number of connections in the network.</s><s>This manipulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6c</ref> "selective permutation") also abolished whitening (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>) and eliminated the specific inhibition of MCs with high r i,t1 at t 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6f</ref>), as observed for the "selective deletion" of connections.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we randomized all connections except for those between the 19 cohort MCs and their IN partners ("selective preservation"; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6c</ref>).</s><s>We found that pattern decorrelation remained intact (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>), contrary to the loss of decorrelation after full randomization of the wiring diagram (Fig. <ref

patterns.</s><s>The activity of MCs with high r i,t1 was strongly reduced at t 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6f</ref>), demonstrating that pattern decorrelation and partial variance

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We used a functional connectomics approach in a small vertebrate to explore the mechanism of whitening in the OB.</s><s>Whitening is a computation related to object classification and associative memory that requires specific transformations of neuronal activity patterns.</s><s>Such computations are thought to rely on specific wiring diagrams that are adapted to relevant inputs.</s><s>Consistent with this notion, we found that whitening is achieved by specific multisynaptic interactions that cannot be described by general topographic principles or by the first-order statistics of connectivity between neuron types.</s><s>Functional connectomics is therefore a promising approach to dissect distributed, memory-based computations underlying higher brain functions.</s></p><p><s>Correlations between input patterns in the OB were dominated by distinct subsets of strongly active input channels.</s><s>This correlation structure is likely to reflect the co-activation of different odorant receptors by discrete functional groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and

eliminated.</s><s>Rather, patterns are decorrelated by the selective inhibition of strongly active, correlation-promoting MC cohorts.</s><s>Pattern decorrelation is therefore achieved by a mechanism that results in contrast reduction, rather than contrast enhancement, which also supports contrast normalization.</s></p><p><s>The tuning-dependent MC-IN-MC connectivity required for whitening may be established by molecular or by activity-dependent mechanisms.</s><s>We reconstructed the wiring diagram of a larva at a stage before activity-dependent effects were detected on the morphological development of glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , suggesting that the initial assembly of neuronal connections may rely primarily on molecular cues.</s><s>Projections of INs are enriched between glomeruli that receive input from odorant receptors of the same families <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , raising the possibility that glomerular targeting of sensory neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> and INs involve related mechanisms.</s><s>However, the development of specific connectivity among OB neurons remains to be explored.</s></p><p><s>Lateral inhibition between neurons with similar tuning is often assumed to sharpen tuning curves by amplifying asymmetries in the input.</s><s>In the OB, however, triplet connections between related MCs are enriched in reciprocal connectivity.</s><s>Such connectivity results in feedback inhibition that is independent of the precise input pattern and down-scales activity without amplifying asymmetries (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">5a</ref>, right).</s><s>Reciprocally connected MC↔IN↔MC cohorts therefore mediate feature suppression because the inhibitory feedback gain within the cohort is larger than the mean feedback gain when an appropriate feature is present.</s><s>This mechanism can explain the selective and odor-dependent inhibition of correlation-promoting MC cohorts.</s></p><p><s>Functional connectomics permitted us to test the significance of this mechanism by implementing the wiring diagram in a network of minimally complex model neurons.</s><s>Simulations included only ~30% of the MC population and did not quantitatively reproduce all details of the measured population activity.</s><s>Nevertheless, the dynamics that resulted in whitening by feature suppression was preserved, demonstrating that the computational function of the circuit is determined to a large extent by its connectivity.</s><s>Whitening was robust against input noise and parameter variations, presumably because the essential connectivity exhibits substantial redundancy.</s><s>Precisely targeted manipulations of the wiring diagram confirmed that feedback inhibition among correlation-promoting MC cohorts was necessary and sufficient to achieve whitening.</s><s>Hence, whitening in the OB depends on higher-order features of connectivity and is produced by a network mechanism that differs from canonical computations in the retina and other sensory systems, presumably because the statistical properties of sensory inputs differ between sensory modalities.</s></p><p><s>In visual cortex, functionally related principal neurons make stronger excitatory connections than random subsets of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Such connectivity can arise from Hebbian plasticity mechanisms, enhance representations of sensory features, and amplify specific inputs in memory networks after learning.</s><s>The connectivity observed in the OB, in contrast, results in disynaptic inhibitory interactions between functionally related principal neurons.</s><s>Functional connectivity in the OB is therefore similar in structure, but opposite in sign, to excitatory connectivity motifs in visual cortex.</s><s>As a consequence, the connectivity in the OB suppresses, rather than amplifies, specific features in the input.</s><s>Such a mechanism appears useful to attenuate the impact of irrelevant sensory inputs and to reduce undesired correlations.</s><s>The mechanism of feature suppression is consistent with
