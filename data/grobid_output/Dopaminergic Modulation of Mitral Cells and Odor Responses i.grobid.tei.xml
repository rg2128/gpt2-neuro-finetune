unclear.</s><s>It is also not known whether DA mediates a global enhancement of rms contrast under physiological conditions because the pattern of DA release may differ from the spatially uniform DA application in our pharmacological experiments.</s><s>Further studies are therefore required to assess the effect of DA on the contrast of odorant-evoked activity patterns and its potential role in odor processing.</s></p><p><s>To understand the function of DA in the OB, it is critical to clarify how DA is released and transmitted to its targets.</s><s>In brain slices, electrical stimulation of sensory afferents evoked DAmediated currents in interneurons only in the presence of a DA transport inhibitor.</s><s>It has therefore been suggested that dopaminergic effects in the OB require pronounced or prolonged changes in neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Maher and Westbrook, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with this hypothesis, direct optical stimulation of periglomerular/short-axon cells produced a D 2 -dependent current in MCs only in response to extended trains of stimuli.</s><s>This hyperpolarizing current was slow and not time-locked to the stimulus, suggesting that DA acting on D 2 -like receptors is released asynchronously and/or transmitted by volume transmission, as in other brain areas.</s><s>Hence, GABA and DA are both released from DA-INs by electrical activity and inhibit MCs, but on different timescales.</s><s>These results suggest that GABAergic transmission is involved in dynamic odor processing, whereas the slow D 2 -dependent actions of DA are unlikely to influence fast odorant responses.</s><s>D 2 -dependent effects of DA may therefore modulate odorant responses on slower timescales and adapt odor processing to changes in the environment.</s><s>DA-INs receiving direct sensory input (K.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kosaka and T. Kosaka, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kiyokage et al., 2010)</ref> are strategically located to generate a modulatory output signal by integration of slowly changing inputs.</s><s>DA could therefore mediate similar general functions in the OB and the retina, although the mechanisms of sensory processing and their modulation by DA are most likely different.</s></p><p><s>The additive membrane potential shift caused by DA is fundamentally different from multiplicative gain modulation in other parts of the nervous system.</s><s>Gain modulation adjusts, for example, the sensitivity of sensory neurons to the relevant range of stimulus intensities.</s><s>An additive modulation, in contrast, shifts the threshold-rather than the sensitivity-of neuronal responses.</s><s>Such an operation could offset slowly changing or fluctuating background input while maintaining sensitivity to other inputs.</s><s>One possible function of DA may therefore be an "additive adaptation" that filters out slow variations in background odors without compromising sensitivity to other stimuli.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, it will be important to determine whether effects of DA are restricted to specific glomeruli.</s><s>Moreover, slow shifts in membrane potential can adapt sensory responses to higher moments of stimulus distributions such as their variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arganda et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The adaptation to more complex features of stimulus distributions has not been studied intensely in olfaction but is important in other sensory systems, for example to optimize contrast and motion sensitivity in vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blakemore and Campbell, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Meister and Berry, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brenner et al., 2000)</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Schematic organization of glomerular neurons.</s><s>Colors indicate neurotransmitter phenotypes.</s><s>Sensory input is transmitted by glutamatergic sensory neurons to the principal neurons (mitral cells) and to subsets of juxtaglomerular neurons.</s><s>DA is coexpressed with GABA in a subset of juxtaglomerular neurons (DA-INs) that project axons to distant glomeruli.</s><s>Other juxtaglomerular neurons include different subtypes of GABAergic periglomerular cells (PGCs) and external tufted cells.</s><s>External tufted cells are not shown in this diagram because they have not been described explicitly in fish.</s><s>Synaptic connections have been drawn after the study by K.
