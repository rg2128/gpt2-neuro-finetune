hypothesis of ''network plasticity'' has therefore been proposed, in which the locus of the adaptive changes are the synapses RGCs receive from the inhibitory amacrine cells, with these synapses

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RGCs Dynamically Tuned to Different Orientations</head><p><s>Are RGCs transmitting a signal to the tectum at each change in stimulus orientation becoming retuned, or might they simply be responding to local changes in luminance when the grating is rotated within their receptive field?</s><s>To distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out two tests.</s><s>First, responses to changes in orientation were measured at two spatial phases of the grating shifted by 45 , and then these were compared with responses to changes in phase (steps of 45 ) at a fixed orientation.</s><s>The example traces in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref> show that recovery of sensitivity to the orthogonal stimulus was very similar at different phases and that a phase change alone usually elicited no response, or else a much smaller response, than the orthogonal stimulus (dashed blue box).</s><s>The averaged synaptic output to this protocol across all 42 RGCs tested in this way is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>.</s><s>Again, a subset of RGCs responded to orthogonal stimuli irrespective of phase and in these cells phase changes alone elicited much smaller responses.</s><s>These results confirm that RGCs responding to all changes in stimulus orientation were dynamically altering their tuning to this feature of the stimulus.</s></p><p><s>Among the 46 RGCs that were dynamically tuned, the response to a shift in orientation depressed by 92.0% Â± 0.1% within 0.26 Â± 0.31 s, effectively suppressing the transmission of redundant information.</s><s>Within $9 s of this profound adaptation, the neurons had become re-tuned to allow signaling of a future change in stimulus orientation, demonstrating the ability to generate a dynamic predictive code <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hosoya et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sharpee et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Smith and Lewicki, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Together, the results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> demonstrate that the retina of zebrafish informs the brain of orientated features in the visual world through two functionally distinct groups of RGCs, either dynamically or statically tuned.</s></p></div>
