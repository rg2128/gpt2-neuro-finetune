hypothesis of ''network plasticity'' has therefore been proposed, in which the locus of the adaptive changes are the synapses RGCs receive from the inhibitory amacrine cells, with these synapses obeying an anti-Hebbian plasticity rule that strengthens them when they are co-activated with the RGC <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hosoya et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>In this scheme, a vertically

are strongly tuned to orientation through lateral antagonism in the orientation domain.</s><s>Further, a subset of RGCs was driven by a mixture of excitatory synapses tuned to different orientations, providing the basic connectivity for a modifiable pattern detector.</s><s>The nulling of a constant input is then generated through at least two mechanisms: depression of excitatory synapses and fast feedforward inhibition (FFI).</s><s>The basic features of this circuit are found in many other parts of the brain and may provide a general design for the dynamic tuning of neurons and removal of

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RGCs Dynamically Tuned to Different Orientations</head><p><s>Are RGCs transmitting a signal to the tectum at each change in stimulus orientation becoming retuned, or might they simply be responding to local changes in luminance when the grating is rotated within their receptive field?</s><s>To distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out two tests.</s><s>First, responses to changes in orientation were measured at two spatial phases of the grating shifted by 45 , and then these were compared with responses to changes in phase (steps of 45 ) at a fixed orientation.</s><s>The example traces in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref> show that recovery of sensitivity to the orthogonal stimulus was very similar at different phases and that a phase change alone usually elicited no response, or else a much smaller response, than the orthogonal stimulus (dashed blue box).</s><s>The averaged synaptic output to this protocol across all 42 RGCs tested in this way is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>.</s><s>Again, a subset of RGCs responded to orthogonal stimuli irrespective of phase and in these cells phase changes alone elicited much smaller responses.</s><s>These results confirm that RGCs responding to all changes in stimulus orientation were dynamically altering their tuning to this feature of the stimulus.</s></p><p><s>Among the 46 RGCs that were dynamically tuned, the response to a shift in orientation depressed by 92.0% ± 0.1% within 0.26 ± 0.31 s, effectively suppressing the transmission of redundant information.</s><s>Within $9 s of this profound adaptation, the neurons had become re-tuned to allow signaling of a future change in stimulus orientation, demonstrating the ability to generate a dynamic predictive code <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hosoya et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sharpee et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Smith and Lewicki, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Together, the results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> demonstrate that the retina of zebrafish informs the brain of orientated features in the visual world through two functionally distinct groups of RGCs, either dynamically or statically tuned.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection of Spatial Patterns Originates in the Synaptic Compartment of Bipolar Cells</head><p><s>To investigate how some RGCs dynamically alter their tuning to spatial patterns, we began by asking whether their excitatory inputs might be sensitive to orientation.</s><s>Electrical recordings in the somata of bipolar cells have not yet revealed any orientation selectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hosoya et al., 2005)</ref>, but it is known that inhibitory inputs to the synaptic compartment can dramatically modify the electrical signal that drives their output <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asari and Meister, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nikolaev et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>By imaging iGluSnFR, we directly assessed the signal transmitted by bipolar cells.</s><s>The raster plot in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> shows iGluSnFR signals from 606 synaptic inputs onto the dendrites of 27 RGCs; 47% of these synapses displayed significant orientation selectivity and individual examples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>.</s><s>The distribution of OSIs measured for bipolar cell synapses displayed two distinct populations; the smallest group (30%) had a median OSI of 0.3, but the remaining 70% were almost perfectly selective for one orientation over the orthogonal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed this finding by surveying the whole population of bipolar cell synapses using zebrafish expressing a fast version of GCaMP6 fused to synaptopyhsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Johnston et al., 2014)</ref>; $25% of these displayed orientation selectivity when tested with either moving bars (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>) or the grating stimulus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>), and there was a clear preference for vertically oriented stimuli (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>).</s><s>These results demon- strate that the analysis of orientation within the zebrafish visual system begins within the synaptic compartment of bipolar cells.</s></p><p><s>The kinetics of the signals encoding orientation within the retina and the optic tectum were profoundly different.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref> compares the averaged output of RGCs displaying dynamic predictive coding (black) with the subset of bipolar cell synapses tuned to the horizontal (red).</s><s>Bipolar cell outputs declined by an average of 49% over a 10 s period, in general agreement with the kinetics of contrast adaptation at the bipolar cell synapse measured using electrophysiology in slices <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jarsky et al., 2011)</ref> or the optical reporter sypHy in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nikolaev et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Odermatt et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, the output of RGCs adapted completely with a dominant time constant of between 0.17 s and 0.25 s.</s><s>Although depression intrinsic to bipolar cell synapses will also contribute to nulling the output to a constant signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gollisch and Meister, 2010)</ref>, this process is too slow and incomplete to account for the extent of adaptation in the signal delivered to the tectum (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>The rapid ''zeroing'' of the retinal output in the face of an unchanging visual input is key to removing redundancy in the signal transmitted to the brain, and these results demonstrate that the retina carries out this operation after the bipolar cell synapse.</s></p></div>
