<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intermingled mating and fighting neurons</head><p><s>We first employed conventional non-isotopic analysis of c-fos induction, a surrogate marker of neuronal excitation16, to map activity during offensive aggression in the resident-intruder test17.</s><s>For comparison, we performed a similar analysis during mating with females.</s><s>Mating and fighting induced c-fos mRNA in the medial amygdala, medial hypothalamus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), as previously described in rats and hamsters13,15, but not in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) which has been implicated in aggression by many studies18-19 (reviewed in <ref type="bibr">ref 20)</ref>.</s><s>While the pattern of mating vs. fighting-induced c-fos was similar in most structures, such between-animal comparisons do not distinguish whether these social behaviors activate the same or different neurons.</s></p><p><s>To address this issue, we adapted a method, called cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescent in situ hybridization (catFISH)21-22 to compare c-fos expression induced during two consecutive behavioral episodes in the same animal (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-f</ref>).</s><s>We examined four limbic regions (VMHvl, ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv), medial amygdala posterodorsal (MEApd) and posteroventral (MEApv)) that exhibited strong c-fos induction in single-labeling experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Animals sacrificed immediately after 5 min of fighting had almost exclusively nuclear c-fos transcripts, while those sacrificed 35 minutes after fighting had essentially only cytoplasmic transcripts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>In animals that engaged in two successive episodes of the same behavior separated by 30 min, most cells expressing nuclear c-fos transcripts also expressed cytoplasmic c-fos mRNA (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c, d, g</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>, green and red bars), indicating activation during both behavioral episodes.</s><s>By contrast, in animals that sequentially engaged in two different behaviors, only 20-30% of cells with nuclear c-fos RNA also expressed cytoplasmic c-fos transcripts (Figs. 1e, f, g and S3, blue and magenta bars).</s><s>(Nevertheless, the overlap between nuclear and cytoplasmic c-fos hybridization was slightly greater than expected by chance even when the two sequential behaviors were different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>)).</s><s>These results suggest, firstly, that the same neurons are likely to be recruited during two successive episodes of mating or fighting, even though such neurons are relatively sparse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>, &lt; 12% of total cells c-fos + ); and secondly, that mating and fighting may recruit overlapping but distinct sets of neurons in these brain regions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chronic recording from the VMHvl</head><p><s>To gain further insight into the relationship between neurons active during mating and fighting, we performed chronic single-unit recordings in awake, behaving male mice using a 16-wire electrode bundle23 (see Methods).</s><s>We selected VMHvl for these studies, because it showed preferential c-fos induction after fighting vs. mating (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>; aggression-induced cfos in VMHvl was further confirmed by double labeling for c-fos and vglut2, a glutamate transporter enriched in VMH; Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>), and because it overlaps partially with the rat HAA7.</s><s>Recording from VMHvl is challenging because of its deep location, and small size; in only 5 of 30 implanted animals were all 16 electrode tracks confined to VMHvl (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>Neurons excited during social behaviors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2h</ref>, red dots) were rarely found from the 25 mistargeted animals.</s><s>We successfully recorded from 104 well-isolated cells in the 5 VMHvltargeted animals.</s><s>By holding the same cell during alternating, sequential exposures to female and male stimulus animals (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and<ref type="figure">S8</ref>), we could distinguish whether the unit was activated by males and/or females (see Methods for unit isolation criteria).</s></p><p><s>Neuronal activity patterns in VMHvl during social encounters showed diverse temporal dynamics and sex-selectivity (Figs. 2, 3, S8 and S9).</s><s>Spontaneous firing rates prior to introduction of the stimulus animal were typically low (median = 1.1 Hz, range 0-12.7 Hz) and rarely increased during home cage behaviors (i.e.</s><s>grooming); some cells were completely silent until the stimulus animal was presented.</s><s>Spiking activity was correlated with behavior by computer-assisted manual annotation of videotape (see Methods).</s><s>Over 50% (53/104) of recorded cells increased their firing rate during at least one behavioral episode of a social encounter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>A large fraction (41%; 43/104) of VMHvl cells exhibited increased firing during an encounter with a male stimulus animal, and on average spiking activity increased with escalation of the encounter, independent of intruder strain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>In many cases <ref type="bibr">(19/43)</ref> this increase began as soon as the intruder male was introduced, and continued as the social encounter progressed, while in a comparable number increased firing was observed only during close investigation and subsequent attack (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b-d</ref>, middle plots, and 3a; Movie S1).</s><s>Strikingly, a small subset of cells (12%; 5/43) was excited exclusively during attack (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e, middle plot,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In contrast, during encounters with females, spiking activity in VMHvl tended to increase only transiently during the initial investigative phase, and subsequently declined as mating progressed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>Among 35 cells that were excited during female investigation, almost two-thirds (23/35) decreased their firing during subsequent mounting (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> and<ref type="figure">f</ref>; left, right; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), and 7 were suppressed (below their baseline firing rate) during thrust and ejaculation (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f, right, S9c</ref> and<ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Almost half (25/53) of all activated cells were excited by both males and females, although most of the largest increases in activity were in sex-specific cells (see Footnote S1 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore most of this overlap was transitory, occurring during the initial stages of the social encounter and diminishing as the interaction progressed to the consummatory phase of attack or copulation.</s><s>The observation of partially overlapping populations of male-and female-excited cells in VMHvl qualitatively confirms the results of our fos catFISH studies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref> and Footnote S1).</s><s>However, the evolving segregation of the two populations as the social encounters progressed was not anticipated by the IEG analysis, due to its insufficient temporal resolution.</s></p><p><s>Our electrophysiological recordings also revealed that the majority (14/18) of male-excited cells were actively suppressed (below their baseline firing rates) during encounters with females (Figs.</s><s>2c, 3c, 3d, S8a, c, e and g; Movie S2).</s><s>Most (86%; 12/14) of those cells, moreover, responded to male intruders prior to any physical contact.</s><s>This observation suggests that cells excited during the initiation of an aggressive encounter are selectively suppressed during interactions with a female.</s><s>In contrast, of the 10 cells selectively excited by females, only 2 were actively suppressed during a male-male encounter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f,</ref><ref type="figure">middle</ref>).</s><s>This asymmetry in sex-specific inhibitory responses indicates that suppression of fightingrelated neurons during mating is more pronounced than the converse.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optogenetic stimulation induced attack</head><p><s>We next tested whether functional manipulations of VMHvl would affect mating or fighting.</s><s>Although VMHvl overlaps the rat HAA7-8,24, extensive attempts to elicit attack by conventional electrical stimulation of this region in mice were unsuccessful (see Footnote S2, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>).</s><s>As an alternative, therefore, we expressed Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in VMHvl neurons unilaterally, using stereotactic co-injection of adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV2) expressing Cre recombinase and a Cre-dependent form of ChR2-EYFP25-26, and selectively illuminated cells in this region using an implanted fiber-optic cable27 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>Because AAV2 infects neurons preferentially28 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12</ref>) and does not retrogradely infect cells from their axons or nerve terminals29, only neurons whose cell bodies are local to the injection site express ChR2 (Footnote S3).</s><s>Optotrode recording in anaesthetized animals confirmed that ChR2 expressing cells in VMH can be driven to fire with high temporal precision (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with this result, c-fos could be strongly induced in VMHvl on the infected, but not the contralateral control side after repeated blue light stimulation in awake behaving animals (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b-e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Optogenetic stimulation of VMHvl in the absence of an intruder did not obviously alter behavior, except for an occasional increase in exploratory activity.</s><s>In contrast, in the presence of an intruder, illumination elicited a rapid onset of coordinated and directed attack, often towards the intruder's back (Movie S3, see Methods for more detailed behavior description).</s><s>Importantly, whereas male mice rarely spontaneously attack females or castrated males, 11/16 ChR2-expressing males exhibited attack towards such intruder animals, within 4-5 seconds after the onset of illumination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4l</ref>), over multiple trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4k</ref>, Test 1, blue bars).</s><s>In 9/11 animals, attack was induced during a second test session 1-6 days later (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4k</ref>, Trial 2).</s><s>Animals with low infection (&lt;10 cells/section, N = 4) or animals injected with saline during the surgery (N = 4) showed no obvious behavioral changes during light stimulation.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, upon illumination offset test animals ceased attack towards females significantly faster than towards castrated males (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4l</ref>, Attack offset).</s><s>Furthermore, when low intensity (1 mW/mm 2 ) light was used, castrated males were attacked more readily than females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4m</ref>).</s><s>We also tested whether illumination could induce attack towards anaesthetized intruders or inanimate objects.</s><s>Six of 10 animals attacked stationary anaesthetized animals upon illumination; all test animals attacked if the anaesthetized intruders were artificially moved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4n</ref>).</s><s>Two of 8 test animals attacked a stationary inflated glove, while 6/8 animals attacked if the glove was moved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4n</ref>; Movie S4).</s></p><p><s>Histological analysis revealed that when the majority of infected cells was located in VMHvl, light stimulation effectively induced attack (red circles in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4p</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, freezing and flight were observed when VMHdm and VMHc were infected to an equal or greater extent (green circles in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4p</ref>)30.</s><s>Infection in other regions, such as VMHvl anterior, the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and tuberal nucleus (TU) was not associated with illumination-induced behavioral changes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14</ref> and S15, Footnote S4).</s><s>To test more directly whether neurons in regions of the HAA8 surrounding VMHvl are sufficient to induce aggression, we deliberately infected such regions with AAV2-ChR2.</s><s>No attack could be induced by light stimulation in such animals (N = 5).</s><s>Strikingly, in cases where the AAV2-ChR2 spread into VMHvl, attack was induced (N=3) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S16</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that neurons located within VMHvl, but not in adjacent regions, play a key role in mouse aggression.</s></p><p><s>The observations that overall activity in VMHvl decreases during male-female mating (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>), and that many male-excited cells are inhibited by females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>), suggested that a progressive inhibition of attack neurons occurs as mating progresses towards its consummatory phase.</s><s>To test this, we stimulated VMHvl during encounters with females, prior to mounting, during intromission, between intromissions and after ejaculation.</s><s>When illumination was delivered prior to mounting, attack towards the female was elicited in over 80% of trials at light intensities between 1-2mW/mm 2 , in all 7 tested animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4o</ref>, white bar).</s><s>But during intromission, the same light intensity was often ineffective, even with extended stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4o</ref>, black bar).</s><s>Increasing the light intensity 4-fold elicited female-direct attack during intromission in 5 of 7 animals, but with increased latency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S17</ref>).</s><s>Between intromissions, attack was evoked in 30% of cases.</s><s>Strikingly, following ejaculation the frequency of illumination-evoked attack recovered to pre-mounting levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4o</ref>, dark gray bar).</s><s>Thus mating exerts an increasingly strong suppression of optogenetically stimulated attack, as the encounter progresses towards its consummatory phase.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mouse aggression requires VMHvl activity</head><p><s>Whether neurons that mediate brain stimulation-evoked attack are also required for naturally occurring aggression has been controversial.</s><s>Electrolytic lesions of VMH in rats and mice have yielded seemingly contradictory results31-32, and this method destroys axons-ofpassage as well as cell bodies.</s><s>There is little evidence that local chemical inhibition of neuronal activity in the rat HAA reduces aggression (although inhibition33 or killing34 of Substance P receptor-expressing neurons attenuates "hard biting" behavior).</s><s>We therefore asked whether reversible genetic suppression of electrical excitability in VMHvl neurons inhibits attack behavior.</s><s>To do this, we used separate AAV2 vectors to co-express two subunits (α and β) comprising a C. elegans ivermectin (IVM)-gated chloride channel (GluClαβ)35, which has been mutated to eliminate glutamate sensitivity36.</s><s>Upon IVM binding, this heteropentameric channel prevents action potential firing by hyperpolarizing the membrane28,35.</s></p><p><s>Three weeks after viral injection, animals were administered IVM (i.</s><s>p.) 24 hr prior to testing28.</s><s>The experimental group (n = 33) exhibited a decrease in the total attack duration, and an increase in the latency to the first attack, in comparison to saline-injected or GluClβonly injected controls (Figs.</s><s>5f &amp; g; see Methods).</s><s>Furthermore, 25% of the experimental animals failed to initiate any attack during the post-IVM test.</s><s>Experimental animals performed similarly in the rotarod assay before and after IVM administration, indicating no change in motor coordination or fatigue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S18</ref>).</s><s>Eight days after the IVM injection, the aggression level of the test group recovered to the pre-IVM level and could be suppressed again by a second IVM injection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5h</ref>).</s><s>Immunohistochemical analysis (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref> and<ref type="figure">d</ref>) indicated a reverse correlation between the suppression of aggression and the percentage of GluCl-expressing cells in the posterior half of VMHvl (Bregma level -1.4-1.75 mm; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5k</ref>).</s><s>No such correlation was found in VMHvl anterior (Bregma level -1.15-1.4</s><s>mm) or in other regions surrounding VMHvl (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S19</ref>).</s><s>Double-label immunostaining for GFP and Fos in animals sacrificed 1 hr after an aggressive interaction (following IVM washout) indicated that viral infection overlapped the population activated during fighting ([(GFP + Fos + )/total Fos + ] &gt;50%; n = 4; Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b-e</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that genetic silencing of neurons in VMHvl can reversibly inhibit aggressive behavior.</s><s>In GluCl-expressing males paired with females, no change in mounting duration or latency to the first mount was observed after IVM injection (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5i</ref> and<ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>Since the overall level of neuronal activity in VMHvl is normally suppressed during the consummatory phase of mating (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>), it is not surprising that further inhibition of activity failed to impair such behavior.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Using genetically based manipulations in mice, we show that neurons necessary and sufficient for offensive aggression are localized within a small subdivision of VMH.</s><s>The more diffuse HAA identified in rats6,24 may reflect a species difference, or the fact that electrical stimulation mapping37 activates both axons-of-passage and neuronal somata, while our manipulations are restricted to the latter.</s><s>Our in vivo recordings indicate that some neurons in VMHvl are activated by intruder conspecifics prior to physical contact.</s><s>This suggests a function in olfactory coding, perhaps related to sex discrimination.</s><s>However, optogenetic stimulation of VMHvl evoked aggressive behavior towards an inanimate object, arguing for a causal role in the motivation or drive to attack.</s><s>We suggest that VMHvl plays a key role in sensori-motor transformations and/or the encoding of motivational states9 underlying aggression.</s><s>The relationship of the aggression circuits within VMHvl to those involved in defensive12,20,38 or maternal39-40 aggression remains to be investigated.</s></p><p><s>While VMH is well established to play a key role in female reproductive behavior41-42, it has not traditionally been considered as a key node in male mating circuitry11 (but see13).</s></p><p><s>We have identified cells within the VMHvl of males that are activated during male-female mating, and which are mostly distinct from those activated during fighting.</s><s>The role of these neurons is not yet clear, since our functional manipulations did not perturb mating behavior.</s><s>One possibility is that these female-activated neurons serve to inhibit aggression during mating.</s><s>Consistent with this idea, many male-activated units were actively inhibited by females, and a higher intensity of illumination was required to evoke attack towards a female during mating encounters.</s><s>These data identify a neural correlate of competitive interactions between fighting and mating1.</s><s>Whether this competition originates in VMHvl, or is controlled by descending inputs to this nucleus43, awaits further investigation.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral tests</head><p><s>All test animals used in this study were adult proven breeder C57BL/6 male mice (Charles River Laboratory).</s><s>They were singly housed under a reversed light-dark cycle for at least 1 week before the test.</s><s>The care and experimental manipulation of the animals were carried out in accordance with the NIH guidelines and approved by the Caltech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</s><s>For resident-intruder assays, C57BL/6 males were allowed to interact with BALB/c males for 10 min.</s><s>All intruder mice were group housed, and had similar body weight as the test mice.</s><s>All resident animals included in the study initiated all the attacks and showed no submissive postures during the aggression test.</s><s>For mating tests, the residents were allowed to interact with sexually receptive BALB/c and C57BL/6 females for 10 min.</s><s>Females were screened for receptivity by pairing with a singly housed C57BL/6 male mouse briefly before each test.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In situ hybridization</head><p><s>Brains from mice sacrificed 30 minutes after performing either the 10 min resident-intruder or mating tests were analyzed for expression of c-fos mRNA throughout the forebrain, using non isotopic in situ hybridization on 120 μm-thick sections.</s><s>Details of the procedure have been described previously44.</s><s>For fos catFISH experiments, animals experienced two consecutive 5 min fighting or mating episodes 30 min apart, and were sacrificed immediately after the second episode.</s><s>Since c-fos transcripts are detected only in the nucleus within the first 5 minutes following induction, and are completely translocated to the cytoplasm as processed mRNA after 35 minutes, the sub-cellular location of c-fos allows one to distinguish neurons activated by a single stimulus from those successively activated by both stimuli: Only in the latter case will transcripts be present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.</s><s>We used an intronic fos probe with a different fluorescent color label, in addition to the fos cRNA probe, which allowed us to more easily differentiate nuclear from cytoplasmic FISH signals.</s><s>The c-fos transcript distribution pattern was examined using both color combinations (fos cRNA probe in green and fos intronic probe in red, or vice versa) and no difference was observed.</s><s>See Supplementary Methods for more detailed dFISH procedure and microscopic analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrophysiological recording</head><p><s>A bundle of sixteen tungsten microwires (13 μm diameter each, California Fine Wire) attached to a mechanical microdrive was implanted in one hemisphere and secured with bone screws and dental acrylic during stereotactic surgery.</s><s>The drive was a miniaturized version of an original design described elsewhere45.</s><s>Two weeks after initial implantation, and on days of recording, a flexible cable was attached to the microdrive and connected to a torqueless, feedback-controlled commutator (Tucker Davis Technology).</s><s>During recording sessions, the test animals were allowed to stay in their home cage and interact with the stimulus animals freely.</s><s>Female or male mice were introduced into the test arena for approximately 10 min.</s><s>A given type of stimulus (e.g. a male mouse) was presented on multiple occasions, to examine the reproducibility of a response.</s><s>All recordings were carried out in subdued light with infrared illumination.</s><s>A commercial recording system was used for data acquisition (Tucker Davis Technology).</s><s>Digital infrared video recordings of animal behavior from both side and top view were simultaneously streamed to a hard disk at 640 × 480 pixel resolution at 25 frames per second (Streampix, Norpix).</s><s>Each video frame acquisition was triggered by a TTL pulse from the recording setup to achieve synchronization between the video and the electrophysiological recording.</s><s>Spikes of individual neurons were sorted using commercial software (OpenSorter, Tuck Davis Technology), based on principal component analysis.</s><s>Unit isolation was verified using autocorrelation histograms.</s><s>To ensure that single units were isolated, and that the same units were recorded in the presence of sequentially presented male or female stimulus animals, we imposed four criteria to select cells for subsequent statistical analysis.</s><s>First, the cells had to have a signal/noise ratio &gt; 3; second, the spike shape had to be stable throughout the recording; third, the response had to be repeatable during multiple trials; fourth, the percentage of spikes occurring with inter-spike intervals (ISIs) &lt; 3 ms (the typical refractory period for a neuron) in a continuous recording sequence had to be &lt; 0.1%.</s><s>74 out of 104 cells included in the analysis had all of their ISIs ≥ 3 ms.</s><s>After each recording session, the microwire bundle was advanced 70 μm, by adjusting a 00-90 screw on the drive 1/4 turn.</s><s>After 5 to 10 recording sessions, which typically were distributed over 2 to 3 months, animals were sacrificed and the location of the recording electrodes verified histologically.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral annotation and statistical analysis of firing rate changes</head><p><s>Custom software written in Matlab was used to facilitate manual annotation of mouse behavior from videotaped recording sessions.</s><s>Annotations were made using side-and topview videos played simultaneously.</s><s>A total of ~1000 10 min videos were carefully analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis.</s><s>The behavioral results were then correlated with the electrophysiology to obtain histograms of firing rates during various behavioral episodes.</s><s>Firing rates for each unit were averaged in 0.5 sec bins, and the mean firing rate during each behavioral episode (e.g.</s><s>"Investigation") was compared to the baseline firing rate (i.e., prior to introduction of the test animals) using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks (with p value 0.01), followed by a pairwise test for significance with Tukey-Kramer correction for multiple comparisons, to determine whether there was any statistically significant change in activity during a given episode.</s><s>If the same stimulus was tested multiple times, only repeatable responses were regarded as positive.</s></p></div>
