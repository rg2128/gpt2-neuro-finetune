<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>The present mapping of projections obtained after sparse labeling of different cell groups in serotonin rostral raphe subnuclei showed that there are topographical rules for the projections along the three major axes of the brainstem, rostrocaudal, medio-lateral and dorsoventral.</s><s>Thus, although a given raphe subgroup sends broad axon projections to the forebrain and brainstem, there is a defined topographic organization of these projections, with some very striking specific targets in particular arising from the MR cell groups.</s><s>The topography of projections relates to the cytoarchitectonic delimitations previously established in the raphe, and follows in part the rhombomeric organization of the raphe that has been recently described.</s><s>However, the developmental origin from different rhombomeric territories does not suffice to explain all the characteristics of the topographic organization that is observed within the DR (B7-B6) cell groups.</s><s>Therefore, it is likely that, similar to other brain circuits, a combination of axon guidance molecules both attractive and repulsive is involved, to guide 5-HT raphe neuron axons to their proper brain targets.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>in which the genome is based on recombinant AAV2, while the capsid is based on AAV1 or AAV9.</s><s>Both allow the GFP expression under the CAG promoter after Cre excision of the LoxP-Stop-LoxP (LSL) sequence.</s><s>A few pilot experiments utilized the AAV1.CAG.-FLEX.EGFP.WPRE.bGH</s><s>(catalog reference AV-1-ALL854) from Penn Core Vector (University of Pennsylvania, USA) in which a flip-excision (FLEX) switch allows</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
