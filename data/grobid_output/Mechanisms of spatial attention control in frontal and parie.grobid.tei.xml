echo time (TE) ϭ 41 ms; flip angle ϭ 90°].</s><s>Twenty to 25 axial slices [slice thickness ϭ 2 mm, gap ϭ 1 mm, in-plane resolution ϭ 2 ϫ 2 mm 2 ] covering frontal, parietal and dorsal occipital cortex were acquired in 12 series of 104 volumes each for the spatial attention task and in eight series of 144 volumes or six series of 240 volumes for topographic mapping of frontal and parietal

of non-interest were included in the model to account for variance due to baseline shifts between time series, mean, linear, and quadratic trends, and head motion parameter estimates.</s><s>To study the relationship of the frontoparietal attention network with topographic areas in frontal and parietal cortex, attended conditions were contrasted with unattended conditions.</s><s>Statistical maps were thresholded at an F score of 10.80 ( p Ͻ 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons).</s><s>Activated voxels were assigned to topographically organized areas in frontal (FEF, PreCC/IFS) and parietal (IPS1-IPS5, SPL1) cortex, as described in Definition of ROIs in topographically organized frontal and parietal cortex.</s><s>All remaining activated voxels that were located outside of topographic frontal and parietal cortex were analyzed as "non-topographic" frontal or parietal cortex, respectively.</s><s>The only exception was activated voxels located in the region of the human SEF in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which is an area that lacks topographic organization, but can be identified based on anatomical and functional characteristics.</s><s>All analy-ses were performed separately for the RH and LH.</s><s>Thus, activity related to spatial attention was analyzed in 14 PPC areas (IPS1-IPS5, SPL1, and non-topographic PPC in RH and LH) and seven frontal areas (FEF, PreCC/IFS, and non-topographic frontal cortex in RH and LH, and SEF).</s><s>To quantify the overlap between the frontoparietal attention network and the topographically organized areas, the volume of the overlapping regions was then computed.</s><s>To report Talairach coordinates, the statistical maps and structural images for each subject were transformed into Talairach space <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Talairach and Tournoux, 1988)</ref> (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Voxels that were assigned to topographic areas were often contiguous with clusters that were located outside topographically organized cortex.</s><s>Therefore, it is possible that all of the activations obtained in the spatial attention task would overlap with topographically organized areas if a stringent enough threshold were applied.</s><s>To address the possibility that the results were affected by arbitrarily chosen statistical thresholds used to generate statistical maps in the spatial attention task, a control analysis was conducted at different significance levels, one with a more liberal threshold ( p Ͻ 0.01) than the one used in our main analysis ( p Ͻ 0.001)  and one with a more conservative threshold ( p Ͻ 0.0001).</s><s>We hypothesized that if different thresholds affected voxels assigned to topographic and non-topographic regions similarly, the proportion of voxels assigned to the different regions would remain the same regardless of the statistical threshold for the spatial attention task.</s><s>Thus, even though the absolute number of voxels may increase or decrease in each area as a function of threshold, such an increase or decrease would be equally distributed across the different areas.</s><s>Alternatively, if for example, non-topographic activations located adjacent to topographic areas were merely artifacts of a liberal threshold, the proportion of voxels would shift toward those located in topographic areas, which would present a confound for the data analysis.</s><s>We calculated the average number of voxels activated in the spatial attention task that were located in topographic regions and in non-topographic regions for each of the three thresholds and then determined the proportion of voxels (topographic relative to nontopographic).</s><s>One-way repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed for each hemisphere and region of interest (ROI) to determine whether the proportions differed depending on the threshold chosen for the spatial attention task.</s><s>A quantitative analysis of the time series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals obtained in the spatial attention task was performed for each ROI and in each subject.</s><s>The time series analysis was based on activated voxels yielded by the contrast attended versus unattended (thresholded at an F score of 10.80, p Ͻ 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons).</s><s>The raw fMRI signals were extracted from the motion-corrected and undistorted echoplanar imaging images.</s><s>Linear, mean, and quadratic trends were removed from the time series, and the signals were then averaged across all voxels within a given ROI.</s><s>fMRI signals for a given experimental condition (i.e., "attended," or "unattended") were normalized to the mean intensity of the four time points preceding the particular condition to yield percentage signal change and sorted by the location at which the visual stimuli were presented (LVF or RVF).</s><s>Mean signal changes were then derived for each of the conditions by averaging the eight peak intensities of the fMRI time series obtained in a given condition.</s><s>The mean signals within each of the ROIs in the LH and RH were further quantified for each subject by defining an Attention Modulation Index [AMI ϭ (R att Ϫ R unatt )/(R att ϩ R unatt ); R, response as mean signal change; att, directed attention to the target location; unatt, peripheral stimuli ignored], which is an estimate of the magnitude of attentional effects on visually evoked activity.</s><s>The AMI ranges from ϩ1 to Ϫ1, with positive values indicating response enhancement and negative values indicating response suppression.</s><s>AMIs were defined separately for presentation conditions in the RVF and LVF.</s><s>A Lateralization Index (LI) was defined for each of the ROIs in the LH and RH for each subject to assess the degree to which the fMRI signals obtained in the attended condition showed a preference for contra-or ipsilateral presentations Since each ROI contained a different number of voxels, we considered the possibility that some of the results were due to volume differences among ROIs.</s><s>To account for volume effects, a control analysis was conducted in which a fixed number of 20 voxels were randomly chosen from each ROI.</s><s>The same analyses and statistical tests as described above were conducted for the fixed-volume ROIs in each subject and in the group.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[LI ϭ (R contra Ϫ R ipsi )/(R contra ϩ R ipsi ); contra,</formula><p><s>To assess the spatial specificity of attention signals in voxels assigned to topographic areas, voxels within frontal cortex and PPC that responded to both tasks were separated into four ROIs based upon saccade phase (that is, whether they most strongly responded to memory-guided saccades made into the upper right, lower right, upper left, or lower left visual quadrants).</s><s>Using Pearson's linear correlation, the time course of each voxel for the attention task was then correlated with the time course of every other voxel within the same ROI and between ROIs.</s><s>This analysis yielded a 4 ϫ 4 correlation matrix for each lobe (frontal cortex and PPC) and for each subject: the average pairwise correlation between spatial attention time courses of voxels within the same ROI as compared to the average pairwise correlation between voxel time courses within each of the different ROIs.</s><s>The correlation of the time course of each voxel to itself was removed, as not to artificially inflate the average correlation values.</s><s>Subjects' correlation matrices were then averaged to obtain a group correlation matrix separately for frontal cortex and PPC.</s></p><p><s>If the same voxels were responsive when subjects both covertly attended and performed memory-guided saccades to a particular quadrant, then the average pairwise correlation between attention time courses of voxels within the same ROI (defined by saccade phase) should be higher than the average pairwise correlation between voxels belonging to different ROIs.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we first calculated the difference between the average of the on-diagonal elements and the average of the off-diagonal elements of the 4 ϫ 4 correlation matrix (the OnOff measure) for voxels within frontal cortex and PPC.</s><s>The OnOff measure provided a single number that described how well attention time courses correlated between voxels within the same ROI versus those within different ROIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Polyn et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A permutation test was then used to determine the significance of the OnOff correlation measure for the group data.</s><s>For each subject and separately for frontal cortex and PPC, the location of each voxel was scrambled, so that a voxel was randomly assigned to a ROI and a new correlation matrix was calculated.</s><s>Individual correlation matrices were averaged to create a new group correlation matrix and a new OnOff value.</s><s>Ten thousand iterations were performed, which generated a distribution of OnOff values.</s><s>A p value was then determined using the generated distributions for frontal cortex and PPC and the actual OnOff values obtained from the experiment.</s></p><p><s>Definition of ROIs in topographically organized frontal and parietal cortex.</s><s>Topographic areas in frontal and parietal cortex can be defined using a variety of tasks, including passive viewing of a colorful and dynamic periodic mapping stimulus that is also typically used to determine retinotopic maps in visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Swisher et al.,

of all the different approaches is to map retinotopically organized areas in higher-order cortex and to define ROIs that can be used for subsequent independent investigations of their response properties (e.g., spatial attention functions, in the case of the current study).</s><s>This overall approach is not different from that taken in many studies investigating response functions of retinotopic visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kastner et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tootell et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tootell et al., ,

eight or 12 peripheral locations arranged clockwise around a central fixation point, with peripheral locations appearing 10 Ϯ 2.5°f rom fixation.</s><s>Stimulus eccentricity in the memory-guided saccade task was similar to the stimulus eccentricity used in the spatial attention task.</s><s>Therefore, both tasks covered approximately the same visual space.</s><s>A Fourier analysis was used to identify voxels activated by the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bandettini et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Engel et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>To correctly match the phase delay of the time series of each voxel to the phase of the visual stimulus/saccade direction, and thereby localize the region of the visual field to which the underlying neurons responded best, the response phases were corrected for the hemodynamic lag (3 s).</s><s>Contiguous clusters of voxels within frontal and parietal cortex activated by the memoryguided saccade task, showing a smooth progression of phase values corresponding to different visual field target locations and displaying phase reversals at shared boundaries between areas, were defined as topographically organized ROIs.</s></p><p><s>In

most likely leading to a mix of results.</s><s>Topographic subunits showed a contralateral bias, but those located outside topographic higher-order cortex, including the SEF, did not.</s><s>These different subregions within the frontoparietal attention network may play different roles in the attentional selection process.</s><s>Attention signals in nontopographic areas may subserve the general maintenance of an attentional state throughout the task, thereby sustaining goaldirected behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Schlag and Schlag-Rey, 1987)</ref>, whereas topographic areas may

the macaque brain (for a more detailed discussion, see <ref type="bibr">Konen and Kastner, 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Silver and Kastner, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Third, we show asymmetries in the spatial biasing signals generated by several of these topographic areas across hemispheres.</s><s>And fourth, our findings inform spatial attentional control models that are largely based on behavioral studies in neglect patients, particularly interhemispheric competition accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kinsbourne, 1977)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several theories based on behavioral data from neglect patients have been proposed to explain how the intact human brain controls spatial attention.</s><s>Heilman's hemispatial theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Heilman and Van Den Abell, 1980)</ref> has proposed that the RH directs attention to both visual hemifields, whereas the LH directs attention to the RVF only (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mesulam, 1981)</ref>.</s><s>This account is supported by the far greater prevalence of neglect following RH damage than LH damage as well as fMRI studies demonstrating a greater extent of activations in the RH than in the LH <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Corbetta et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nobre et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gitelman et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, Kinsbourne's interhemispheric competition theory has proposed an opponent processor control system, in which the two hemispheres each direct attention toward the contralateral visual field (or via a cortico-subcortical loop involving the SC) and balance one another through reciprocal inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kinsbourne, 1977)</ref>.</s><s>This theory is supported by evidence that patients with extinction will often manifest directional biases, favoring stimuli that are relatively ipsilesional over those that are relatively contralesional within and between visual fields.</s><s>It therefore appears that with damage to frontal and parietal cortex, there is a gradient of attention loss across the visual field, rather than a complete loss of attention to one hemifield.</s><s>The Kinsbourne model is further supported by evidence that neglect patients show improvement when TMS is used to interfere with the control system of their intact hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Oliveri et al., 1999)</ref>, presumably by rebalancing the reciprocal inhibition between the two hemispheres.</s></p><p><s>The current study, based on data from the normal adult brain, potentially provides a neural basis for interhemispheric competition accounts of spatial attentional control <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kinsbourne, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Smania et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, we propose an account (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>) in which each of the LH and RH areas contributes to the control of spatial attention across the visual field by generating a spatial bias, or "attentional weight" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Duncan et al., 1999)</ref>, as indexed by the LI, toward the contralateral hemifield.</s><s>The sum of the weights contributed by each area within a hemisphere constitutes the overall spatial bias that can be exerted over contralateral space.</s><s>As shown by our LI analysis, the net output of attentional weights generated by the two hemispheres is similar, indicating that the control system is normally balanced.</s><s>This balance across the hemispheres may be achieved through reciprocal interhemispheric inhibition of corresponding areas.</s><s>However, the higherorder control system appears to be complicated by the unique role of right SPL1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>).</s><s>The attentional weight generated by this area was not counteracted by left SPL1.</s><s>Instead, left FEF and left IPS1/2 generated stronger weights than their righthemispheric counterparts, possibly to maintain a balanced distribution of attentional resources across the visual field.</s><s>Thus, the LH control system requires the cooperation of several distributed subcomponents to balance the spatial biasing signals generated by the two hemispheres.</s></p><p><s>Our spatial attentional control model makes a number of predictions that can account for key findings from behavioral studies in neglect patients.</s><s>First, our model predicts that dysfunction of right PPC (including right SPL1) will result in a spatial bias toward the RVF and a neglect of the LVF due to the shift of the residual attentional weights toward contralateral space.</s><s>This is in agreement with data from visuospatial neglect patients with damage to right parietal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mesulam, 1981)</ref>.</s><s>Second, our model predicts that if either the left PPC alone or the left FEF and surrounding regions alone were dysfunctional, a strong neglect of the RVF would be less likely to result, since the intact area (e.g., the FEF if PPC were damaged) could compensate for the other.</s><s>Therefore, isolated dysfunction of either left PPC or left FEF is less likely to cause a strong shift in the weights toward the LVF.</s><s>This is in agreement with observations that right neglect occurs much less frequently with isolated frontal or parietal lesions.</s><s>Therefore, together, the first two predictions are consistent with the notion of right hemispheric dominance of attentional function <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Heilman and Van Den Abell, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mesulam, 1981)</ref>.</s><s>Third, our model predicts that both left frontal cortex and left PPC need to be dysfunctional before right neglect is strongly manifested.</s><s>In general, too few studies have examined patients in great enough detail to determine the exact neural correlates of right neglect.</s><s>However, interestingly, right neglect has been reported to occur more frequently in patients with extensive LH damage covering frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bartolomeo et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beis et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kleinman et al., 2007)</ref>, thereby providing some preliminary evidence to support our model predictions regarding the incidence of right neglect.</s></p><p><s>Severe and protracted visuospatial neglect most often results from either right IPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mort et al., 2003)</ref> or right superior temporal gyrus (STG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Karnath et al., 2001)</ref> damage, both of which are quite different from regions typically identified by functional brain imaging studies of spatial attention in healthy subjects.</s><s>One possible explanation is that the spatial attention deficits observed in neglect after damage to the IPL/STG result from cortical dysfunction downstream from the structural lesion, perhaps due to an interruption of connections between IPL/STG and the IPS or SPL, or due to hypoperfused tissue in IPS/SPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hillis et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Future studies using paradigms similar to the one in the present study in both healthy subjects and patients with brain lesions are necessary to better understand and possibly resolve this longstanding discrepancy between the patient and neuroimaging literature.</s></p></div><figure
