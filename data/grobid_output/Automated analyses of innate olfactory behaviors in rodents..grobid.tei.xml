<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Interface</head><p><s>In the latest implementation, one DAQ 6229 and two DAQ 6722 boards (National Instruments) are used to control four olfactometer circuit boards.</s><s>Printed circuit boards (PCBs) were designed using PCB Artist (1.5.1) and manufactured by Advanced Circuits.</s><s>PCBs are used to control individual valves, odor flow rates, TTL outputs and receive signals from infrared sensors in the behavior boxes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROBES Software Design</head><p><s>The software package that controls the olfactometers and behavioral apparatuses was developed in LabVIEW 8 professional development environment (National Instrument).</s><s>The source code was compiled into an executable file (v1.0.5.4) and can be installed on any computer running the Windows XP/7 operating system with LabVIEW runtime engine 8.0.1 (http://www.ni.com/ download/labview-run-time-engine-8.0.1/741/en/).</s><s>Default hardware connections and settings are stored in task and configuration files.</s><s>These files are included in the installation package and can be edited to accommodate different experimental designs.</s><s>With this software, up to twelve devices (e.g., behavior boxes) can be controlled at once by a single computer to allow the simultaneous control and recording of multiple experiments.</s></p><p><s>The software package allows three levels of operations.</s><s>At the entry level, the end users use the software's graphic user interface and choose a package to set up and manage the experimental paradigm.</s><s>The packages contain parameters that determine the logic flow between individual experimental steps and control hardware devices.</s><s>All experimental paradigms can be saved and reloaded.</s><s>At the intermediate level, advanced users can change hardware settings to create more elaborate behavioral tasks.</s><s>Finally, at the source code level, software engineers can make fundamental changes to the software to accommodate more complex tasks, improve memory usage and optimize the software.</s></p><p><s>For general use, the most basic functions are valve control and conditional valve control.</s><s>Valve control commands control a set of MIVs that divert the air flow through the pneumatic system to release odors from user-designated odor sources.</s><s>Users also set the timing and duration of odor release.</s><s>A built-in function sets the overall flow rate to remain constant.</s><s>If a total flow rate is set at 1000 ml/min, when one odor port is set to open and deliver a flow of 100 ml/min, the flow speed for the carrier stream will be reduced to 900 ml/min during odor delivery.</s><s>The carrier stream is reverted back to 1000 ml/min once odor delivery is finished.</s><s>This setting minimizes any mechanical artifact associated with many odor delivery systems.</s></p><p><s>Conditional valve control is a set of commands dependent on other inputs.</s><s>The most common is IR-beam breaking triggered valve actions.</s><s>Beam-breaking events are registered by analog input channels.</s><s>Crossing a user determined threshold triggers the opening of designated odor or water valves with user specified delay and duration.</s></p><p><s>In addition to these two basic functions, several other functions make the software versatile.</s><s>These include a split function, TTL input and output, conditional splits, and a loop function.</s><s>The software also includes functions that allow the cloning of a procedure, and a randomized odor port choice function.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photo-ionization Detector (PID) Measurement</head><p><s>Odor concentrations were measured by miniPID (200B, Aurora Scientific Inc.).</s><s>Signals from the miniPID were digitized by MiniDigi-1B (Molecular Devices) at 1 kHz and low pass filtered (10 Hz) in pCLAMP10.3</s><s>(Molecular Devices).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Video Recording and Tracking</head><p><s>Animal behaviors were video recorded through internet infrared cameras (Vivotek Inc) with 6406480 resolution at 30 Hz frame rate.</s><s>All recordings were performed under infrared illumination.</s><s>Nose poking activities were visually assessed and manually scored in Observer 7.0 software (Noldus).</s><s>For the 3chamber assay, the arena was an 8 cm (w)660 cm (L)68 cm (H) chamber divided into three chambers.</s><s>The two side chambers measured 25 cm long and the middle chamber was10 cm long.</s><s>Odor vials were placed at the end of the side chambers.</s><s>Mice were habituated to the behavior chamber for 30 minutes with empty vials prior to the introduction of odor vials.</s><s>Videos were resampled (15 Hz) and analyzed offline with EthoVision 3.1 (Noldus).</s><s>Time spent in the each zone during odor presentation (5 or 10 minutes) was calculated.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Design of PROBES</head><p><s>The general design of PROBES includes a computer control unit, olfactometers and behavioral boxes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>The apparatus shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> consists of a set of four olfactometers, each connected to a behavioral chamber such that four individual animals can be trained and tested simultaneously (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B&amp;C</ref>).</s><s>Readout from the behavioral boxes is sent to the computer interface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Commands and box readouts are saved in a log file.</s></p><p><s>The behavioral chamber is a simple 20 cm620 cm620 cm acrylic box with a interchangeable front panel that can house up to three ports for different behavioral tasks (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The back panel contains a vacuum port to facilitate air exchange inside the chamber.</s><s>We implemented three configurations to accommodate different behavioral tasks.</s><s>The first one, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>, utilizes a port located in the center with a single paired infrared light emitting diode (IR-LED) and IR detector installed.</s><s>Beambreaking events indicate nose poking by the animal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>This simple implementation can be used for odor threshold detection, cross habituation and odor preference evaluation.</s></p><p><s>The second configuration contains three ports with a single central odor port flanked by two water ports (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>The software allows water reward to be delivered each time when an animal correctly identifies an odor and pokes the appropriate water port.</s><s>This configuration is used for reinforced two-choice assay.</s></p><p><s>In the third configuration, a single port combines both odor and water delivery (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>Odor is delivered through a side channel and a water spout is positioned deep in the port.</s><s>In addition to detecting nose poking events, a second paired IRemitter and detector is positioned just in front of the water spout to register licking events.</s><s>The narrow passage in front of the water spout ensures only licking interrupts the IR beam.</s><s>This configuration allows us to perform the Go/No Go test, in which water-deprived animals can be trained to recognize an odor paired with water reward.</s><s>Incorrect odor identification results in either no reward or punishment in the form of a mild electric foot-shock.</s></p><p><s>Thus, by configuring PROBES, we are able to quickly switch among different experimental paradigms.</s><s>During each experiment, once the animals are placed in the behavioral boxes, no human interaction is needed.</s><s>All odor delivery, determination of reward/punishment, and registration of different events are automatically controlled by the software.</s><s>Animals are confined within a single, undivided chamber, reducing spatial bias.</s><s>Moreover, the automated process allows the user to run up to four separate experiments simultaneously, significantly improving the efficiency of data acquisition.</s></p></div>

processed within minutes.</s><s>This makes it possible to increase the number of animals used in experimental groups to improve the statistical power of the studies.</s></p><p><s>One important application of PROBES is to examine olfactory behaviors in animals naı ¨ve to test odors.</s><s>In our design, examinations of cross habituation, innate odor preference and odor detection threshold do

in evaluating sensory functions.</s><s>Indeed, we are able to use PROBES in cross habituation assays to examine odor discrimination.</s><s>These assays complement the reinforced two-choice and Go/No Go assays in analyzing odor discrimination.</s><s>The efficiency of the system permits the analyses of large numbers of odor pairs in a relatively short time span.</s><s>Paradigms involving associative training, on the other hand, are time consuming and can become arduous when large numbers of animals and different odor pairs are used.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, the differences in DNPI values among different odor pairs may reflect quantitative differences in odor perception.</s><s>In contrast, the two-choice assay, as well as Go/No Go test, is largely binary.</s><s>The animals can be trained to discriminate different pairs of odors to similar levels of success rate.</s></p><p><s>PROBES offers a robust assay for innate odor preference.</s><s>By comparing investigation of the same odor port triggered by different odorants, we reduce variability inherent in multichamber assays.</s><s>However, using PROBES alone does not provide for behavioral parameters such as moving

accurate way to examine odor detection threshold.</s><s>Using the habituation/dishabituation assay, we can determine the odor detection threshold based on the difference between investigations of an odor and control air.</s><s>This psychometric measurement differs from that of the Go/No Go test in that PROBES does not require extensive training.</s><s>Therefore, we are able to examine odor detection in the naı ¨ve state of the animal.</s><s>We observed a more sensitive measure of detection threshold using the habituation/dis-habituation assay than Go/No Go test, which may reflect the consequence of reinforced training.</s><s>The behavioral readout -licking the water spout -is not only determined by odor detection, but also by a decision making process that evaluates the likelihood of reward.</s><s>It is possible that animals choose not to act when odor is detected if the confidence level of obtaining a reward is low.</s><s>They may perform an operant task at an odor concentration above threshold such that they have a higher probability to obtain reward and avoid punishment.</s><s>It is also possible that reward-based training may enhance or inhibit sensitivity and skew the results.</s><s>In habituation/dis-habituation test, animals are largely motivated by odor-driven curiosity to investigate the odor port.</s><s>Odor detection at lower concentrations may be sufficient to trigger investigations without associated rewards.</s><s>In the meantime, variation among individuals is corrected by normalizing the values to the control period.</s><s>Under this condition, bias in decision making associated with stimulus valence is removed and the odor detection threshold measured under this naı ¨ve condition may reflect accurate odor sensitivity.</s></p><p><s>We must note that it is possible innately aversive odors may not trigger increased investigation.</s><s>In this situation, we cannot use our method to determine detection
