<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal coding in individual LEC cells</head><p><s>To explore temporal coding in LEC, we recorded neural activity over more than an hour while rats ran in a box whose walls alternated semi-randomly between black and white on 12 trials (BW12 experiment, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>An extended number of trials was used to increase the likelihood that animals defined multiple temporal contexts across the experiment, while the interleaved design was chosen to avoid confounding changes in wall color with progression of time.</s><s>Data was also recorded from CA3 and MEC for comparison.</s><s>Examining LEC responses by eye, we noticed that some cells exhibited clear ramping activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), raising the possibility that individual LEC cells track the passage of time through their firing rates.</s><s>Responses to specific environmental features such as walls and cue cards <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> were also observed, consistent with LEC's established role in encoding environmental context <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We quantified the influence of wall color and time on the activity of single cells using a generalized linear model (GLM) incorporating time, wall color, and position as variables for fitting the firing rates of individual neurons, which were binned temporally into blocks of 500 ms (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a-d</ref>).</s><s>A significant number of LEC cells were selective specifically for time (20.4% of all recorded cells), while only 2.0% of CA3 cells and 4.5% of MEC cells were selective for time alone (number of cells significantly influenced by at least one variable for LEC: 186/451, 41.2%; CA3: 72/148, 48.6%; MEC: 49/133, 36.8%;</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s><s>The distributions of cell selectivities for LEC, CA3, and MEC were consistent across individual animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because time was modeled as a linearly-increasing function in the GLM, all time-selective cells exhibited some form of ramping activity.</s><s>Both increasing and decreasing ramps across a range of time constants were observed (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>), as would be expected if they performed a Laplace transform of the recent past <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Ramping cells were found in both deep and superficial layers, with no clear difference in the time constants (see Supplemental text).</s><s>Ramping responses, particularly across the entire recording session, were not due to recording instability (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e-g</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>We found little evidence in LEC for non-ramping time-specific activity similar to that of time cells (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEC population states encode temporal information</head><p><s>We next focused on the overall population of LEC cells and asked whether its dynamics reflected time coding.</s><s>We first visualized the overall population data from individual animals using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to determine the dimensions which optimally discriminate the 24 experiment-defined states (12 trial, 12 intertrial), and plotting the 2D projection yielding the best discrimination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a-c</ref>).</s><s>Population activity for the entire session separated into distinct modes corresponding to the environmental contexts of the experiment, as expected from previous work demonstrating LEC involvement in encoding context <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> .</s><s>In addition, there was a prominent progression of states corresponding to the temporal order of the experiment.</s><s>Thus, across the entire session, the three environmental contexts could be separated along one axis in state space, while the temporal epoch of each trial could be separated along another.</s></p><p><s>To quantify the temporal information present, we trained a linear multiclass support vector machine (SVM) to identify temporal epochs (e.g.</s><s>trial 1, intertrial 1, trial 2, etc.) based on neural activity from individual animals, pooled across recording sessions.</s><s>Population activity defined by the firing rates of cells was binned into 10 s bins, with each bin labeled by the temporal epoch it was in.</s><s>The decoder was then trained to identify temporal epochs based on population activity, with 10-fold cross-validation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>).</s><s>Statistical significance was evaluated using a permutation method (see Methods).</s><s>Very high decoding accuracy for temporal epoch identity across the whole session spanning both trial and intertrial epochs was observed for all LEC animals during the BW12 experiment, indicating significant temporal information was present in LEC population activity (88.0%</s><s>mean accuracy, chance level 4.2%; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>The high decoding accuracy was not due to pooling cells across recording days, changes in behavior or noise-driven variability of population activity states (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e,</ref><ref type="figure">f,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>To further verify our observations, we trained decoders using data from additional LEC animals which ran a simplified 4-trial version of the BW12 experiment (BW4), and obtained similar results (93.1% mean accuracy, chance level 25%; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>Thus, population activity in LEC clearly defined a unique temporal context for every epoch of experience on the timescale of minutes.</s></p><p><s>Visualization of data from CA3 and MEC revealed population activity patterns different from LEC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Quantification of temporal information across the entire session, including both trial and intertrial periods, using decoders trained on CA3 and MEC data revealed decoding accuracies above chance, but lower than that found in LEC (23.0%, 34.4% mean accuracy for CA3, MEC respectively).</s><s>In order to properly compare decoding accuracy across the three areas, we trained separate decoders for each area using populations with equal size to ensure that higher accuracy was not simply due to the data having higher dimensionality.</s><s>LEC still contained significantly more temporal information than either CA3 or MEC, as decoding accuracy for temporal epoch was higher for LEC by a sizeable margin (45.5% vs. 20.4% vs. 26.2%</s><s>mean accuracies for LEC, CA3, and MEC respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b-c</ref>).</s><s>The difference in decoding accuracy was not simply due to temporal information being more distributed across the population in CA3 or MEC, as LEC required significantly fewer cells to reach high decoding accuracy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4i</ref>).</s><s>In the simplified BW4 experiments, we also had data from CA2 and CA1, allowing us to compare decoding accuracies for temporal epoch across entorhinal cortex and all CA subfields.</s><s>We again found, in separate animals, that decoding accuracy was highest for LEC (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4h</ref>).</s><s>In total, these observations point to LEC as a possible source of temporal context information necessary for episodic memory formation in the hippocampus.</s></p><p><s>Is the robust encoding of time in LEC at the population level due primarily to cells with ramplike activity?</s><s>To test whether cells not classified as selective for time nonetheless also encoded temporal information, possibly in a nonlinear form <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , we trained decoders for temporal epoch using only cells which were not selective for time, and found that decoding accuracy remained very high.</s><s>Comparing against size-matched populations with cells drawn randomly from the entire dataset, decoding accuracy for time using only non-selective cells was not significantly different (77.2% vs. 79.2%</s><s>mean accuracy for trial identity using population with no timeselective cells, compared to a size-matched randomly-drawn population, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>If the temporal information observed within LEC population activity is actually used as a temporal code, is it limited to representing just the macroscopic temporal context of experiences, on the timescale of minutes and longer, or is it also capable of representing the order of events within experiences, which may be on timescales shorter than minutes?</s><s>We examined whether LEC could encode temporal epochs of shorter length than entire trial or intertrial periods by dividing trial-period data into shorter epochs and training decoders to identify these shortened epochs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>).</s><s>Decoding accuracies for 20 s, 10 s, and 1 s epoch-lengths across the entire session were all significantly above chance (27.8%, 21.4%, 1.6% mean accuracy for 20 s, 10 s, and 1 s epochs respectively; chance levels 0.4%, 0.2%, 0.02% respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f,</ref><ref type="figure">g,</ref><ref type="figure">Extended</ref> Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a-c</ref>, see Supplemental text).</s><s>Although decoding accuracy decreased with shorter epoch lengths, decoding errors predominantly predicted adjacent epochs, as opposed to temporally distant epochs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g</ref>).</s><s>Decreased accuracy may have been due to the limited number of cells that we recorded from.</s><s>Pooling together all recorded cells from every animal to generate a population of 451 cells, decoding accuracy for 20 s epochs was 86.0%, while decoding accuracy for 10 s and 1 s epochs were 83.0% and 30.5% respectively.</s><s>Decoding accuracy for shortened epochs was not due to differences in population activity on the timescale of trial or intertrial periods, as decoding accuracy for shortened epochs within single trial and intertrial periods was still above chance (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Thus, temporal information in LEC was flexible enough to support encoding of events happening across a wide range of timescales.</s></p><p><s>In a separate set of experiments, we tested whether changing the content of the animal's experience affected temporal information in LEC by introducing an object into the recording environment.</s><s>We found a similar representation of time at both the single-cell and population level (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Information about the current environmental context (B or W) as well as information about the immediately preceding context was also present in LEC (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4j-l</ref>, see Supplemental Text).</s><s>Overall, these results suggest a large component of LEC population activity codes for time across multiple scales, expressed both through cells explicitly coding time as well as cells having mixed selectivity for time that requires population decoding to extract.</s></p></div>
