inhibitory system remain to be elucidated.</s><s>In Drosophila, the GABAergic anterior paired lateral (APL) neurons mediate a negative feedback essential for odor discrimination; however, their activity is suppressed by learning via unknown mechanisms.</s><s>In aversive olfactory learning, a group of dopaminergic (DA) neurons is activated on electric shock (ES) and modulates the Kenyon cells (KCs) in the mushroom body, the center of olfactory learning.</s><s>Here we find that the same group of DA neurons also form functional synaptic connections with the APL neurons, thereby emitting a suppressive signal to the latter through Drosophila dopamine 2-like receptor (DD2R).</s><s>Knockdown of either DD2R or its downstream molecules in the APL neurons results in impaired olfactory learning at the behavioral level.</s><s>Results obtained from in vivo functional imaging experiments indicate that this DD2R-dependent DA-to-APL suppression occurs during odor-ES conditioning and discharges the GABAergic inhibition on the KCs specific to the conditioned odor.</s><s>Moreover, the decrease in odor response of the APL neurons persists to the postconditioning phase, and this change is also absent in DD2R knockdown flies.</s><s>Taken together, our findings show that DA-to-GABA suppression is essential for restraining the GABAergic inhibition during conditioning, as well as for inducing synaptic modification in this learning circuit.</s><s>Such circuit mechanisms may play conserved roles in associative learning across species.</s></p><p><s>Drosophila aversive olfactory learning | DA-to-GABA suppression | DD2R | disinhibition | memory trace G ABAergic neurons constitute the major inhibitory system in the central nervous system.</s><s>The tight regulation of these neurons is critical for cognitive functions, such as learning and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>In rodents, for example, a group of amygdala GABAergic interneurons innervates principle neurons and exerts negative regulation in fear conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, suppression of these inhibitory neurons using an optogenetic approach facilitates associative learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>It has been reported that these GABAergic neurons are suppressed on dopamine perfusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>, while an independent study showed that another subgroup of GABAergic interneurons provides the control signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>Behavioral studies in Drosophila indicate that the inhibitory Drosophila dopamine 2-like receptor (DD2R) plays an essential role in olfactory learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr"

exclusively to the mushroom body (MB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the center of olfactory learning and memory in flies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Similar to GABAergic interneurons in mammals, APL neurons also negatively regulate aversive learning by suppressing Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>It is known that APL neurons are activated by KCs and also send negative feedback to KCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>This feedback loop is essential for sparse odor coding in the MB and odor discrimination during learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>Intriguingly, the odor response of KCs has been found to increase after conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>, while decreasing significantly in APL neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>These phenomena suggest that other neurons may participate in the regulation of APL neurons during conditioning.</s></p><p><s>In addition to KCs, dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons are the only other neurons known to connect with APL neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</s><s>However, DPM neurons exhibit a delayed increase in activity starting at 30 min after conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> and function only during the stage of memory consolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, we Significance Suppression of inhibitory interneurons, termed disinhibition, has been suggested as a conserved circuit mechanism crucial for associative learning.</s><s>In Drosophila, a pair of GABAergic neurons negatively regulates aversive olfactory learning.</s><s>Here we show that these neurons receive suppressive signals directly from a group of DA neurons through the inhibitory dopamine receptor DD2R.</s><s>During odor-electric shock (ES) conditioning, ES-induced dopaminergic (DA) signal restrains GABAergic inhibition, thereby allowing efficient learning.</s><s>Moreover, this inhibitory DA signal is required for learninginduced synaptic modification.</s><s>Therefore, we propose that the suppressive DA signal provides a new twist on the Drosophila learning circuit, which is essential for accomplishing disinhibition in the learning center and sculpturing a memory trace in the GABAergic inhibitory neurons.</s></p><p><s>propose that specific synaptic connections of APL neurons have not yet been identified, and that these connections may exert suppressive regulation on these GABAergic neurons

(DA) neurons, paired posterior lateral 1 (PPL1) neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>.</s><s>These neurons are strongly activated by ES <ref

target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>).</s><s>We then examined the brains of these flies and detected the GRASP signal in both MB lobe and calyx regions (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure"

type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>, we detected a dense GRASP signal only in the stalks of the vertical lobes and the heels, but only a weak signal in the
