<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Subjects.</s><s>Five subjects participated in the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Panel of Princeton University.</s><s>All subjects (20 -35 years of age; one male) were in good health with no past history of psychiatric or neurological disorders and gave their informed written consent.</s><s>Subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity.</s><s>Four subjects (S1-S4) participated in three separate scanning sessions, one for measuring contrast response functions of the LGN and SC, and a second and third for experiments 1 and 2, respectively.</s><s>Two additional control studies were conducted.</s><s>In the first control study, two of the four subjects (S1 and S2) participated in an additional session during which eye movements were recorded while performing experiments 1 and 2, and in a second control study, two subjects (S1 and S5) participated in a separate session to measure responses evoked by coherent versus incoherent dot motion in the LGN and SC.</s></p><p><s>Visual display.</s><s>The stimuli were generated on a Macintosh G4 computer (Apple Computer) using Matlab software (Mathworks) and Psychophysics Toolbox functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brainard, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pelli, 1997)</ref> and were projected from a PowerLite 7250 LCD projector (Epson) outside the scanner room onto a translucent screen located at the end of the scanner bore.</s><s>Subjects viewed the screen at a total pathlength of 60 cm through a mirror attached to the head coil.</s><s>The screen subtended 30Â°of visual angle in the horizontal dimension and 26Â°in the vertical dimension.</s><s>A trigger pulse from the scanner synchronized the start of the stimulus presentation to the beginning of the image acquisition.</s></p><p><s>Visual stimuli and procedure.</s><s>Visual stimuli consisted of two opposing angular segments of the visual field, comprising a bow tie-shaped pattern that rotated about the fixation point (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Together, the segments spanned approximately the central 30Â°of the visual field.</s><s>To ensure that the measured effects applied more generally and were not tied to specific stimulus features or to particular levels of difficulty in selecting the behaviorally relevant information, we varied in separate experiments the feature content of the stimuli within the bow tie segments, using either moving dot fields in experiment 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref>), or colored shape conjunctions in experiment 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref>).</s><s>A central fixation point was present, and subjects were instructed to maintain fixation for the duration of each scanning run, to attentionally track one of the two segments throughout the scanning run, and, within that segment, to detect changes in the direction of fractional coherent motion or to detect specific color and shape conjunctions.</s></p><p><s>In experiment 1, the two segments were composed of 1000 0.1Â°white dots moving with a speed of 7Â°/s on a black background (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref>).</s><s>On each video frame, 10% of the dots in each segment disappeared and were redrawn in random locations within the same segment such that any dot had an average lifetime of 10 frames or 167 ms.</s><s>A dot disappeared and was redrawn in a random position on reaching the boundaries of the segment.</s><s>The segment boundaries constantly changed as the segment rotated counterclockwise around the fixation point with a period of 40 s.</s><s>In the segment to which each subject had been instructed to attend, a fraction of the dots were moving in a coherent direction, and the remaining dots in that segment as well as in the opposite segment moved randomly.</s><s>Every 1-3 s, the coherent dots would change directions by a random angle.</s><s>The task of the subject, while fixating, was to press a key on detection of each these changes in the coherent direction.</s><s>The difficulty of the task could be adjusted by varying the fraction of coherently moving dots; all subjects were scanned with a coherence of 35 or 40%.</s></p><p><s>From an experiment design perspective, it would have been ideal to present identical motion stimuli in the two segments.</s><s>However, we observed in pilot studies the propensity of coherence changes in the unattended segment to automatically capture attention, thus distracting and confusing the subjects.</s><s>Because the literature suggests that the degree of coherence does not by itself modulate activation in low-level visual structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Braddick et al., 2001)</ref>, our design that omitted the coherence from one segment appeared justified.</s><s>To assure that any differences in responses between the segments was attributable to differences in attention and not coherence, we sought independent verification that the LGN and SC were not sensitive to motion coherence in a control experiment involving one of the main subjects and an additional subject.</s><s>The stimulus consisted of blocks of dots (as in experiment 1) moving either 50% coherently or in random directions.</s><s>Each block lasted for 16 s, and the cycle of coherent and incoherent dots was repeated eight times during each of the seven to eight scanning runs in each subject.</s><s>Interleaved among the dot motion scans were six scanning runs in which a highcontrast rotating checkerboard hemifield stimulus was displayed.</s><s>The hemifield pattern reversed contrast at 8 Hz and rotated counterclockwise through eight cycles per run with a period of 32 s.</s><s>This stimulus served as The two segments rotated counterclockwise around the fixation point with a period of 40 s.</s><s>In one of the segments, a fraction of the dots was moving in a coherent direction, and the remaining dots in that segment as well as in the opposite segment moved randomly.</s><s>Subjects were required to covertly track the segment with the coherent dots and to report changes in the direction of coherent motion.</s><s>B, The color and shape stimulus.</s><s>The segments rotated counterclockwise with a period of 40 s.</s><s>The color and shape combinations were briefly presented within the segment boundaries.</s><s>Subjects were instructed to direct attention to one of the two segments and to detect a unique color and shape combination that would appear only in that segment, for example, a green square.</s></p><p><s>a localizer to identify regions of interest in the LGN and SC in which to measure the response to coherent motion.</s></p><p><s>In experiment 2, the segments were composed of square or circular shapes on a gray background (147.1 cd/m 2 ), scaled linearly in size with eccentricity such that shapes near the fixation point were 0.5Â°per side, and those located at 15Â°eccentricity subtended 1.5Â°(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref>).</s><s>The shapes were randomly positioned within the segments, but did not overlap with any other shape.</s><s>Each shape appeared for 200 -500 ms (700 -1000 ms for target shapes), after which it would disappear, creating a space in which a new shape might appear.</s><s>The duration of the target shape was altered for each subject from run to run to maintain approximately the same performance across subjects and runs.</s><s>As in experiment 1, the boundaries of the segments, and thus the available areas in which new shapes might appear, constantly changed as the segments rotated around the fixation point with a period of 40 s.</s><s>In each segment, the available colors of the shapes were different.</s><s>In one segment, the shapes could be red, blue, or yellow, whereas in the opposite segment, the shapes could be green, blue, or yellow.</s><s>The task of the subjects was to press a key on detection of a unique color and shape combination, either a red or green square.</s><s>Throughout each scanning run, red squares appeared in only one of the segments, whereas green squares appeared only in the other segment.</s><s>The target red and green colors were assigned alternatively to the attended or unattended segments in interleaved scanning runs.</s><s>Subjects were informed at the beginning of each run which target shape and color to detect, and in which of the two segments these conjunctions would be located.</s></p><p><s>A third stimulus, an alternating hemifield was used to measure two points (10 and 100%) of the contrast response function to identify LGN voxels whose responses were likely dominated by M or P neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schneider et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>The stimulus consisted of a checkerboard pattern, contrast reversing at 8 Hz, covering one hemifield but sparing the vertical meridian and central 1.1Â°of the visual field.</s><s>The pattern alternated between the left and right hemifields every 16 s.</s><s>In separate scanning runs, the stimulus was presented at either 100 or 10% contrast.</s><s>Data using this stimulus have been previously reported for some of the subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schneider et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schneider and Kastner, 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Each subject participated in three separate scanning sessions, one each for experiments 1 and 2, and a third session to measure the contrast response.</s><s>In addition, a subset of the subjects participated in a second control experiment in which eye movements were monitored in the scanner to ensure that subjects were able to maintain fixation while performing the sustained peripheral attention task.</s><s>For this experiment, the projection screen had a small hole at the edge, allowing a subject's eye position to be monitored through the subject's viewing mirror via a remote camera (ASL 504 remote optics; Applied Science Laboratories).</s><s>Each of the stimuli used in experiments 1 and 2 was tested in three runs.</s><s>Pupil size and the horizontal and vertical position of the gaze were measured at a rate of 60 Hz throughout each scanning run, and the timing of eye blinks were inferred from the characteristic periods of data loss.</s><s>To determine whether the gaze position and pupil size time series contained any power at the rotational frequency of the stimulus, which would indicate that subjects were tracking the stimulus and not maintaining fixation, the horizontal and vertical eye positions were each averaged over the six scanning runs for each subject, and a Fourier transform was performed on the resulting time series.</s></p><p><s>Data acquisition.</s><s>Data were acquired with a 3 T Allegra head-dedicated MRI scanner (Siemens) using a standard birdcage head coil.</s><s>Six to 14 series of 128 volumes each were acquired with 18 interleaved coronal slices (2 mm thick with no gap between slices) and a gradient echo, echo planar sequence with a 128 square matrix leading to an in-plane resolution of 1.5 Ï« 1.5 mm 2 [repetition time (TR), 2 s; echo time (TE), 41 ms; flip angle, 90Â°].</s><s>A partial Fourier factor of 7/8 was used to acquire an asymmetric fraction of k-space to reduce the acquisition time.</s><s>The posterior edge of the acquisition volume was aligned in the midsagittal plane with the posterior edge of the corpus callosum to cover the posterior thalamus.</s><s>Echo-planar images were compared with a coaligned highresolution anatomical scan of the same subject's brain taken at the beginning of the session (fast low-angle shot; TR, 150 ms; TE, 4.6 ms; flip angle, 90Â°; 256 Ï« 256 matrix; six averages).</s></p><p><s>The subjects' heads were surrounded by foam to reduce head movements; one subject (S3) also used a bite bar.</s></p><p><s>Data analysis.</s><s>To compensate for subject head movement and scanner drift occurring during individual scanning runs and across a scanning session, all volumes acquired in each experiment and scanning run were registered <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jenkinson et al., 2002)</ref> to the same volume acquired in one of the sessions.</s><s>We positioned the acquisition field of view in very similar locations for each subject relative to landmarks visible in the localizer scans across different scanning sessions to facilitate intersession registration; when necessary, the registration algorithm was initialized with the transformation matrix obtained by registering the intersession anatomical images.</s><s>During the registration procedure, each volume was upsampled to twice the resolution in each spatial dimension.</s><s>For each voxel in the volume, the linear trend in the fMRI time series was subtracted and the time series was divided by its mean intensity, converting the data to units of percentage signal modulation.</s><s>The time series of each voxel were averaged across 10 repeated scanning runs of the identical stimulus condition as follows.</s><s>The images obtained during the first cycle of visual stimulation (40 s) were discarded to avoid transient effects of signal saturation and to allow the hemodynamics to reach steady state.</s><s>Therefore, the time series of each voxel contained 120 time points representing six cycles of visual stimulation.</s></p><p><s>A Fourier analysis was performed to identify regions of interest (ROIs) containing voxels activated by the stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bandettini et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Engel et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>For each voxel, the amplitude and phase (the temporal delay relative to the stimulus onset) of the harmonic at the stimulus frequency were determined by a Fourier transform of the mean time series of the voxel.</s><s>The correlation coefficient r between the harmonic and the time series was computed as the amplitude of the harmonic component divided by the square root of the time series power.</s><s>Because the bow tie stimuli contained two frequency components, the main rotation frequency and double that frequency, r was computed using the maximum of the two harmonics.</s><s>To ensure that the same groups of voxels were compared across experiments, the ROIs were composed of voxels that were significantly activated by each of the stimuli.</s><s>To do so, an initial ROI was composed from the set of voxels significantly activated by the average of the mean time series from the two attentional stimuli.</s><s>Statistical maps were thresholded at r Õ 0.25, corresponding to an uncorrected p Ï½ 0.0038.</s><s>ROIs for each LGN and SC were identified as contiguously activated voxel clusters in their anatomical locations, as determined from registered high-resolution structural images of each subject.</s><s>After these initial ROIs were defined from the attentional stimuli, they were further restricted to voxels also activated at r Õ 0.25 by the average of the 100 and 10% contrast stimuli.</s></p><p><s>The responses evoked by the attended and unattended sectors of the stimuli in experiments 1 and 2 were determined separately for each voxel.</s><s>Mean time series of one stimulus period were calculated by averaging all stimulus cycles across scanning runs.</s><s>To compute the smoothed response while avoiding edge effects of the smoothing, three identical raw series were concatenated and smoothed with a five-point moving average, and the middle of the three series was extracted.</s><s>The smoothed single-period average time series were then deconvolved from the hemodynamic response by fitting to a generative response model.</s><s>The model consisted of two square wave sources, each with the same variable width w but different variable amplitudes a 1 and a 2 .</s><s>The two sources were always out of phase by one-half stimulus period, but their absolute phase position was free to vary.</s><s>This model is depicted in supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> A (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>The model was then convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function (mixture of gammas) in supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> B (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) to yield the convolved response model in supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>In the convolved response model, the larger impulse is shifted by the hemodynamic delay such that its response peaks the middle of the response period, and the smaller impulse is shifted so that its peak occurs at the end and wraps around to the beginning of the response period.</s><s>The convolved model response was converted to percentage change, and the best-fitting parameters (a 1 , a 2 , w, and ) were obtained through an optimization procedure.</s><s>The parameters a 1 and a 2 represent the response amplitude to the attended and unattended wedges, respectively.</s><s>w represents the duration of the response to each wedge and therefore the size of the receptive field of the voxel.</s><s>indicates the response delay, which can be converted to the angular polar coordinate of the receptive field location within the visual field of the voxel, and was corrected based on the hemispheric location of each voxel to ensure that a 1 always corresponded to the attended wedge stimulus.</s><s>Attentional modulation indices (AMIs) were calculated from the response amplitudes: AMI Ï­ (a 1 Ïª a 2 )/(a 1 Ï© a 2 ).</s><s>For each subject and stimulus, the mean AMI was calculated for the LGN and SC, pooled across hemispheres.</s></p><p><s>To determine the contrast sensitivity of voxels and therefore potentially classify voxels as containing predominantly M or P neurons, we calculated a contrast modulation index (CMI) based on the response amplitudes to the 100% (A 100% ) and 10% (A 10% ) contrast stimuli: CMI Ï­ (A 100% Ïª A 10% )/(A 100% Ï© A 10% ).</s><s>M neurons are expected to exhibit a smaller response difference between 100 and 10% contrast stimuli than P neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sclar et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tootell et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schneider et al., 2004)</ref> and were therefore expected to exhibit smaller CMIs.</s><s>To test whether the attentional modulation depended on the CMI, the voxels in each ROI were divided into two groups, one with CMI Ï½ 0.25 and

whereas the SC exhibited nearly uniform enhancement throughout its structure, except near the vertical meridian, the LGN contained regions of both enhancement and suppression.</s><s>In both the LGN and SC, groups of voxels that were the least sensitive to changes in stimulus contrast tended to be most strongly enhanced by attention.</s><s>In the LGN, this suggests that the M layers are more strongly enhanced by sustained attention than the P layers.</s></p><p><s>Attentional modulation in the LGN has been reported in three other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Vanduffel et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">O'Connor et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">McAlonan et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The first report of attentional modulation in the LGN was a deoxyglucose study in the macaque <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Vanduffel et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, when a monkey attended to the orientation features of a stimulus, activity in the M layers of the LGN was suppressed at retinotopic locations just peripheral to the stimulus, compared with a spatial attention task, in which no such suppression was observed.</s><s>There was little difference in modulation between the two tasks at retinotopic locations representing the stimulus, or in the P layers of the LGN.</s><s>In the present study, rather than comparing modulations between two types of attentional tasks, we compared the responses evoked by attended stimuli to those evoked by unattended stimuli, and we did observe attentional modulation in the area of the LGN that represented the stimulus.</s><s>In fact, because we defined our ROIs based on the responses to the stimulus, our analyses were restricted to portions of the LGN representing the stimulus, which, given the retinal magnification factor with eccentricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schneider et al., 2004)</ref>, encompassed the vast majority of the LGN volume.</s><s>We observed attentional modulation throughout the structure of the LGN, and therefore we conclude that the effects of attention are not limited to the M layers of the LGN.</s><s>Although we were not able to isolate the individual LGN layers at the spatial resolution used in this study, the correlation between contrast sensitivity and attentional modulation suggests that the response enhancement was stronger in the M than in the P layers.</s><s>This finding corroborates accounts of selective attention suggesting that the M neurons are essential for the allocation of attentional resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cheng et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>However, our results also show that, although the attentional modulation was stronger in LGN voxels likely to be dominated by M input, they were not confined to these portions of the LGN.</s></p><p><s>Our findings nicely converge with the results of a recent electrophysiology study that examined effects of spatial attention in M and P neurons of LGN as well as TRN neurons in monkeys trained on a stimulus matching task.</s><s>It was shown that both M and P neurons were modulated by attention with an effect size of Ï³10% in the population, similar to the magnitude of attention effects measured with hemodynamic signals in the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McAlonan et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a distribution of attentional effects in individual neurons showed both weak suppression and generally stronger enhancement effects, similar to our observations at the level of single voxels.</s><s>Importantly, the physiology results suggest that the attention effects in the LGN are mediated through inhibitory control of TRN neurons.</s></p><p><s>The third study, an fMRI investigation of the human LGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(O'Connor et al., 2002)</ref>, reported enhanced responses to a peripheral flickering checkerboard when attention was directed to it instead of a competing task at the fixation point; increasing the difficulty of the central task increased the magnitude of this effect.</s><s>In addition, attending to a flickering checkerboard stimulus presented in one hemifield increased its response relative to an ignored checkerboard presented simultaneously in the opposite hemifield.</s><s>This latter experiment, which was most comparable with those in the present study, produced an effect with an AMI of 0.0925, comparable with the mean AMI of 0.073 Ï® 0.013 measured in the present study in the LGN.</s></p><p><s>O'Connor et al. ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) used standard resolution fMRI, which does not permit investigating the subdivisions of the LGN, and reported modulatory effects on the LGN as a whole.</s><s>In the present study, we used higher-resolution fMRI and were able to detect attentional effects in individual LGN voxels.</s><s>With the higher resolution, we were not only able to investigate differential effects of sustained attention on the M-and P-LGN, but also to determine the retinotopic specificity of the attentional effects.</s><s>Surprisingly, we observed robust clusters of attentional enhancement or suppression within the LGN structure, and we were able to determine that the locations of these clusters were not directly correlated to the retinotopic organization.</s><s>Each retinotopic polar angle location appeared to be represented by some voxels exhibiting attentional enhancement and others exhibiting suppression.</s><s>The existence of suppressive regions is a novel finding, although its functional and structural significance within the LGN is unclear.</s><s>The suppressive regions within the LGN are different from the zones of suppression that might surround a "spotlight" of attentional enhancement or from the suppression that has been observed in the unattended regions of the visual field <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tootell et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brefczynski and DeYoe, 1999)</ref>; rather, the suppressive regions in the LGN are those in which the response to the attended one-half of the stimulus was weaker than the response to the unattended one-half that was located in the opposite hemifield.</s><s>The initial responses of neurons in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus are suppressed by attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McAlonan et al., 2008)</ref>, but its connections to the LGN are inhibitory <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Yingling and Skinner, 1976</ref>) LGN AMI</s></p><p><s>LGN Retinotopy SC AMI SC Retinotopy and are unlikely to be responsible for the suppression effects observed in parts of the LGN.</s></p><p><s>Compared with the LGN, the magnitude of the attentional modulation in the SC was quite large.</s><s>On average, the response amplitudes evoked by the unattended sector of the stimuli were 40% less than those evoked by the attended sector.</s><s>This compares to a 10% modulation in the LGN.</s><s>The SC belongs to a distributed network of brain areas, including the frontal eye field (FEF), responsible for eye movements and shifts in attention (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wurtz and Albano, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sparks, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moschovakis et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr"

<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sommer and Wurtz, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>One of the primary functions of the SC may be to orient attention in space and to prepare orienting motor responses, but a role for the SC in sustained attention has not yet been established.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have shown that the SC is modulated by attention during transient spatial cueing and eye movement tasks.</s><s>In an fMRI study, the SC was more strongly activated during an overt search task compared with nondirected eye movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gitelman et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Several electrophysiological studies in the macaque have shown that responses in neurons in the intermediate layer of the SC are enhanced during covert shifts of attention, when stimuli are spatially cued <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Robinson and Kertzman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gattass and Desimone, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kustov and

2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee and Keller, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>In the macaque, neurons in the rostral SC exhibited an increase of activity in response to visual motion that would subsequently be a target for pursuit, similar to the increases in activity that occur before a saccade <ref type="bibr">(Krauzlis, 2004b)</ref>.</s><s>The results of the present study establish the importance of the SC in sustained spatial attention, in addition to its functional role in relation to saccadic eye movements or in reaction to spatial cues.</s><s>In contrast to these results, preliminary results from a recent electrophysiology study suggest that only the FEF, but not the SC, is modulated by endogenous shifts in attention, whereas both structures are modulated by reflexive shifts of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(McPeek and Lee, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Additional research will be necessary to address this discrepancy in findings from electrophysiology and neuroimaging.</s></p><p><s>In addition to being modulated by spatial attention, the SC can be modulated by feature-based attention.</s><s>Previous functional imaging studies have found that SC activity is modulated by selective attention to motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bu Â¨chel et al., 1998)</ref> or shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Corbetta et al., 1991)</ref>.</s><s>In these studies, however, the attentional enhancement in the SC was not shown to be spatially specific and could possibly be attributed to changes in motivation or arousal.</s><s>In the present study, the attended and unattended sectors of the stimuli were constantly present on the screen, and attention was constantly deployed during the task, which rules out nonspecific arousal as a source of the attentional effects.</s><s>In addition, we found that the attentional effects did not depend on the difference in features between the two distinct types of stimuli we used.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, activity in two of the subcortical visual nuclei, the LGN and SC, can be modulated by sustained spatial attention.</s><s>The attentional modulation in the SC was especially prominent, indicating its importance in spatially directing and sustaining attention.</s><s>Our results suggest that both attentional enhancement and suppression can be observed throughout the structure of the LGN, and that M parts of the LGN may be less likely to exhibit suppression than the P parts.</s><s>High-resolution fMRI will prove useful in future studies to further define the effects of cognitive control on the different processing streams that originate in sep-arate classes of retinal ganglion cells and remain disjoint in the subcortex before converging in the cortex.</s></p></div><figure
