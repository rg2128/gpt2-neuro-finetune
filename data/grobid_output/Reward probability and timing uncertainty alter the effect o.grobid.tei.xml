In Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, P-values of pairwise Mann-Whitney U-tests were multiplied by m, where m was the number of pairwise Mann-Whitney Utests.</s><s>Statistically significant differences were achieved when P-value × m &lt; 0.05.</s><s>m was 15 and 10 in Scheirer-Ray-Hare test and Kruskal-wallis test, respectively.</s><s>Data collection and analysis were not performed blind during the experiment, and no randomization was used.</s><s>In a very small number of omission trials, mice removed the nose from the reward site within 1.5 s (in the 75% one-pellet test, 2 for serotonin activation trial and 2 for serotonin no-activation trial; in 50% three-pellet test, 3 for serotonin activation trial, and 4 for serotonin no-activation trial; in the 50% one-pellet test, 1 for in serotonin activation trial; in the 25% three-pellet test, 4 for serotonin activation trial and 2 for serotonin no-activation trial; in the 25% onepellet test, 1 for serotonin activation trial and 1 for serotonin no-activation trial; in the D10 test, two for serotonin no-activation trial).</s><s>These data were excluded from the analysis.</s><s>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, Matlab (MathWorks), and R.</s></p><p><s>Bayesian decision model of waiting.</s><s>Each trial had a hidden state X = {reward, no-reward}, and for a reward trial, the timing of reward delivery was given by a Gaussian distribution N(t; μ, σ 2 ).</s><s>Given an observation that a reward had not been delivered by time t, the likelihood for a reward trial was 1f(t; μ, σ 2 ), where f is the cumulative Gaussian density function, whereas the likelihood for a no-reward trial was one.</s><s>The posterior probability for a reward trial, given observation of no reward by time t is</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P rewardjt ð Þ¼P reward ð Þ ð1 À f ðt; μ; σ 2 ÞÞ=½P reward ð Þ ð1 À f ðt; μ; σ 2 ÞÞ þP no reward ð Þ ;</formula><p><s>where P(reward) and P(no reward) are prior probabilities of reward and noreward trials.</s></p><p><s>The expected reward to keep waiting was V(wait|t) = P(reward|t) for a unit of reward, while the expected reward for quitting was V(quit|t) = 0 as no reward is obtained by quitting.</s><s>By assuming a softmax action selection, the choice probability to keep waiting at time t is</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P waitjt ð Þ¼1=ð1 þ exp½ À β P rewardjt ð ÞÞ;</formula><p><s>where β is the inverse temperature parameter regulating the stochasticity of choice.</s><s>The distribution of the time of quitting P quit (t) is given by sequential decisions:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P wait 0 ð Þ ¼ 1;</formula><p><s>P wait t ð Þ ¼ P wait ðt À τÞ P waitjt ð Þ;</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P quit t ð Þ ¼ P wait ðt À τÞ 1 À P waitjt ð Þ ð Þ ;</formula><p><s>where P wait (t) is the probability of continuing to wait until time t and τ is the interval of repeated decision to wait or to quit.</s><s>In Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, we used parameters τ = 0.1 s and β = 50.</s><s>The code of the Bayesian waiting decision model was written in Python.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.1Schematic of the sequential tone-food waiting task.</s><s>a Diagram of the test in which optogenetic stimulation was applied during the reward-delay period (experiments 1 and 2).</s><s>b Time sequence of serotonin activation trials and serotonin no-activation trials.</s><s>In serotonin activation trials, 0.8 s of blue light was delivered at the onset of the reward delay.</s><s>In serotonin no-activation trials, 0.8 s of yellow light was applied at the onset of the reward delay.</s><s>In each trial, 1 s of yellow light was used at the onset of food presentation or at the reward wait error.</s><s>Blue and yellow bars denote blue and yellow light stimulation, respectively.</s><s>Brown-and red-shaded regions denote tone-and reward-delay periods, respectively.</s><s>Orange-shaded regions denote duration of tone presentation.</s><s>c Locations of optical fibers in the DRN.</s><s>Light blue bars in the DRN represent tracks of implanted optical fibers.</s><s>Coronal drawings were adapted from ref.<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> with permission</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
