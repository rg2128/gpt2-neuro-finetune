<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Respiration, a fundamental rhythm of mammalian life, is inextricably linked to olfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Shusterman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Kay, 2014)</ref> and sensory system activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ito et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kleinfeld et al., 2014)</ref> in rodents, but poses unique challenges in terms of accurate measurement.</s><s>Current methods employ the use of temperature or pressure sensors placed within the nasal cavity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Shusterman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Smear et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Reisert et al., 2014)</ref> or in front of the nares <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ito et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, these methods have significant drawbacks.</s></p><p><s>Extranasal thermistors are an easy-to-use, non-invasive option for capturing the temperature changes associated with respiration for use in head-fixed mice.</s><s>However, extranasal thermistors become less reliable during periods of high-frequency sniffing.</s><s>This is because mice can move their nares and thereby redirect the respiratory airstream, which they often do during sniffing.</s><s>This causes variability in the phase of the readout and can temporarily result in the loss of signal for one or more cycles.</s><s>The beginning of inspiration is also difficult to reliably capture, as the probe is continually cooling towards the room temperature.</s><s>Consequently, extranasal thermistors are most effective when expiration onset during resting breathing (&lt;6 Hz) is of interest, and can be used effectively for creating circular data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ito et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Pressure sensor coupled chambers for plethysmography offer highly precise measurement of respiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lim, 2014)</ref> , but, by their nature, require rather small recording chambers.</s><s>This makes them impractical for behavioral experiments that require space for equipment and allow some degree of free movement for the animals.</s><s>However, simple odor response tests have been successfully conducted in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Youngentob, 2005)</ref> and rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Hegoburu et al., 2011)</ref> with this approach.</s><s>Chronic implantation of sensors allows for the greatest potential mobility for the animal, but current approaches typically penetrate the bone and epithelial tissue overlying the nasal cavity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Shusterman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Smear et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Reisert et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Pressure changes associated with respiration are measured by placement of a small cannulae into the nasal cavity, allowing for highly accurate readings of respiratory efforts.</s><s>However, the placement of even very small cannulae into the cavity will cause partial blockage of the narrow airway, leading to irritation and the formation of mucus.</s><s>Cannulae are prone to blockage by this mucus or blood over time, requiring the blockage to be cleared using high pressure, suction, or the insertion of a wire.</s><s>These procedures are likely to cause irritation of the highly sensitive soft tissues of the nasal cavity and constitute additional stressors for the mouse.</s><s>In addition, a pressure transducer or hose needs to be mounted to the cannula during readings, which adds considerable weight and mechanical stress above the nasal bridge.</s></p><p><s>Intranasal temperature sensors as described in some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Uchida and Mainen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Wesson, 2013)</ref> suffer similar drawbacks, as they also penetrate the nasal cavity thus interfering with airflow and causing damage to the epithelium.</s><s>This approach may still be preferable to pressure cannula since connection to a signal-transducing amplifying system can be accomplished with minimal-weight 2-pin connectors mounted on top of the skull rather than a pressure transducer attached to the cannula on the bridge of the nose.</s><s>An additional advantage is that the 2-pin connectors do not restrict the animal's field of vision and are solidly fixed to multiple anchoring screws placed in the skull bone.</s></p><p><s>Problems with implanted instrumentation penetrating the nasal cavity are exacerbated in mice due to the narrowness of their nasal cavity and the weakness of their neck muscles, which struggle to support heavy monitoring equipment and connectors.</s><s>Yet, use of mice for such experiments is highly desirable because of readily available genetic tools and disease models in the species.</s><s>The method of using a non-invasive implant that we present here overcomes many of the pitfalls described above.</s><s>Animals who underwent this implantation rapidly recovered.</s><s>There is virtually no waiting time, other than recovery from surgery, before high quality respiratory data can be recorded.</s><s>This is in stark contrast to some current methods, which require days or weeks of recovery before respiratory signals can be recorded <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Wesson, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>We demonstrate that this method is highly effective and precise in both head-fixed and freely moving experimental preparations.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animals</head><p><s>Adult male and female C57BL/6J mice were housed with food and water ad libitum in a 12:12-h light/dark cycle.</s><s>All mice used in this study were raised and all experiments were performed in accordance with procedural guidelines approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center Animal Care and Use Committee.</s><s>Principles of laboratory animal care <ref type="bibr">(NIH publication No. 86-23, rev. 1996)</ref> were followed.</s><s>Animals were monitored for up to 4 days post-surgery to ensure proper recovery before experimentation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probe fabrication</head><p><s>Fast time response NTS thermistors (MEAS-G22K7MCD419, Measurement Specialties; Hampton, VA) were used as the temperature sensitive element of the probe.</s><s>Leads were cut to 5cm in length before wires were separated and stripped of insulation on 1mm of the distal end.</s><s>The stripped ends were then soldered to the pins of a miniature male-female header plug (e.g.</s><s>Mill-Max Engineering, U.S.A., part#: 861-13-0XX-10-002000) and the soldered connections were insulated with a thin layer of acrylic cement or epoxy.</s><s>All probes were tested and treated with 90% ethanol for disinfection prior to implantation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgical Procedure</head><p><s>Prior to surgery, mice were weighed and injected with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail to induce anesthesia.</s><s>Maintenance of anesthesia throughout the surgery was accomplished by supplemental injections of ketamine.</s><s>An analgesic was subsequently given (0.05ml carprofen solution, s.c.) to facilitate recovery.</s><s>Once anesthetized, mice were mounted in a surgical stereotaxic frame using 60° non-rupture ear bars (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA).</s><s>Body temperature was monitored with an electronic rectal thermometer and maintained at 37-38.0 °C using a feedback controlled heating pad (FHC Inc., Bowdoinham, ME).</s><s>Eye moisture was maintained by application of sterile lubricating eye ointment <ref type="bibr">(Systane, Alcon Inc., Missuaga, Ontario)</ref>.</s><s>With care to avoid contact with the eyes, hair was removed from the scalp and nose with scissors and a depilatory cream and the skin was treated with iodine solution (Xenodine, Veterinary Products Laboratory, Phoenix, AZ).</s></p><p><s>A sterile scalpel was used to make a midline incision to expose the skull surface from the interparietal skull plate to the anterior edge of the nasal bone.</s><s>The surface was then cleaned using a dental scraper and sterile cotton swabs.</s><s>A dental drill (0.7mm round burr) was used to create a hole in the posterior skull for a small machine screw, used to anchor the headcap (B000FN0J58, Antrin Miniature Specialties, Fallbrook, CA).</s><s>Antibiotic ointment was immediately applied to the screw hole to prevent infection and dryness.</s><s>The dental drill was also used to create the opening for thermistor implantation above the anterior portion of the nasal bone, centered 0.5mm lateral from the midline suture (Nasal fissure +3.1mm).</s><s>This typically caused minimal to no bleeding and revealed a small cavity overlying highly vascularized soft tissue.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this cavity has not been previously described in the anatomical literature, but exists between the nasal epithelium of the dorsal meatus and the frontonasal bone due to a lack of connective tissues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The probe was then carefully lowered into this cavity with forceps, while the connector remained attached to a stereotaxic manipulator.</s><s>We did not find it necessary to fully insert the probe into the cavity; partial insertion (as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) yielded no appreciable reduction in signal quality over completely inserted probes (data not shown).</s><s>Partial insertion thus was preferred to further reduce the risk of damage to the nasal epithelium or narrowing of the airway.</s><s>A small amount of KwikSil epoxy (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) was then applied to cover the probe and allowed to dry in order to protect the temperature sensitive element and seal the opening.</s><s>We found this step to be crucial, as direct contact of the probe with acrylic cement seemed to damage the thermistors.</s><s>Once dry, skull screws were implanted in their pre-drilled holes and a head fixation bar was attached to the skull bone with super glue.</s><s>The probe connector was then released from the stereotaxic arm and excess lead wire was coiled around the stem of a cotton swab until the connector piece was able to rest adjacent to the skull screws with an orientation that would not interfere with later head fixation.</s><s>Acrylic dental cement was then applied to the exposed skull, embedding skull screws, thermistor connector and head fixation bar.</s><s>Mice were then placed in individual cages under infrared heat lamp until fully awake, and monitored for up to 4 days to ensure proper surgical recovery.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Acquisition</head><p><s>Recording sessions began on the fourth day after surgery.</s><s>Data were stored on a computer hard disk (16 bit A/D converter, sampling rate 2 kHz) using a CED Power1401 and Spike2 software (both Cambridge Electronic Design, UK).</s></p><p><s>Head-fixed recording-Accuracy of respiratory monitoring by the implanted thermistor was tested by simultaneously recording respiration with a piezoelectric transducer.</s><s>Mice were placed into the head fixation apparatus and covered by a foam-lined plastic half-tube to prevent injury from excessive movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bryant et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The implanted thermistor was connected to a custom-built amplifier and the resulting temperature-related voltage changes were digitized at 2 kHz (CED 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) and stored on hard disk.</s><s>A piezoelectric strip was placed against the lateral chest wall to detect inflation of the chest cavity.</s><s>Movements of the chest wall would bend the piezoelectric strip, which resulted in a measurable electrical current (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>A second thermistor connected to a second amplifier was placed in front of the nares for simultaneous comparative recording.</s></p><p><s>Freely moving recording-Feasibility of recording respiration in freely moving mice with the minimally invasive thermistor was assessed during a recording session in a custom plethysomgraphy chamber (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Prior to recording the chamber was connected to a pressurized air inlet and pressure was calibrated to create 0.5 L/min of continuous airflow through the chamber.</s><s>The plethysmography chamber ceiling was coupled to the positive inlet of a differential pressure transducer with carrier demodulator (DP45-14 and CD15 respectively, Validyne Engineering, Northridge, CA) to detect changes in chamber pressure.</s><s>Voltage output from the demodulator was digitized at 2 kHz (CED 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) and stored on hard disk.</s><s>Implanted probes were again connected to the amplifier via a thin 1 m long wire.</s><s>Mice were then allowed to move freely for several minutes while thermistor and plethysmograph data were continuously recorded.</s></p><p><s>Recording of Sniffing Behavior-Effectiveness for measurement of spontaneous sniffing behavior during odor discrimination was assessed in a novel variant of an odor response task previously described in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Wesson et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The odorants selected for exposure were ethyl tiglate (ET), ethyl butyrate (E4), acetophenone (Ac), citronellyl isobutyrate (Cit), ethyl valerate (E5), benzaldehyde (Bz), ethyl hexanoate (E6), and 2-heptanone (2H).</s><s>Mice were habituated to head fixation on a treadmill in front of an odor port with continuous airflow before exposure to odorants.</s><s>Once habituated, mice were exposed to the same odorant multiple times for 1 second durations at 1 minute intervals until they no longer responded with fast sniffing.</s><s>The familiar odor was then alternated with a battery of novel odorants with a range of structural similarities, and respiration responses were simultaneously recorded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p><s>Data were analyzed in Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) or exported to Matlab (The Mathworks, U.S.A).</s><s>All recordings were preprocessed in Spike2 by applying a smoothing filter with a time constant of 5ms; this was realized as a 20 th order FIR filter with all coefficients equal to 1/20.</s><s>A DC removal filter was also implemented for both thermistor signals in order to subtract slow drifts in the temperature signal unrelated to respiration phase (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref> for example).</s><s>DC removal was achieved by subtracting the result of the smoothing filter with coefficient of 50ms (a 200 th order FIR filter with all coefficients equal to 1/200) from the original signal.</s><s>Timing of respiratory events in the thermistor signals was compared to corresponding timing of events in the piezoelectric signal.</s><s>Circular estimates of respiratory phase were created by normalizing each respiratory cycle duration to 2π using the beginning of inspiration in the piezoelectric signal.</s><s>Relative error of thermistor events was calculated using extranasal thermistor event time minus the corresponding event time in the minimally invasive thermistor.</s><s>Mean chamber pressure was subtracted from plethysmograph signals using the same DC removal algorithm with a time constant of 500ms so that 0 values correspond to mean chamber pressure.</s><s>Frequency-dependent effects of respiration on waveform amplitude were not analyzed, as temperature changes can occur independent of airflow.</s><s>Furthermore, the drift removal process reduces the amplitude of slower cycles, thus obscuring this relationship in the already tenuous link between nasal temperature and respiratory tidal volume.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of Head-fixed Recording Methods</head><p><s>We performed a direct comparison of methods by recording respiration in head-fixed mice (n = 3) using three different methods simultaneously.</s><s>The recording of chest expansion via a piezoelectric strip served as the reference as it provided the most direct and precise measurement of inspiration onset.</s><s>Only periods of stable piezo measurements of chest movements were used for further analysis.</s><s>The second signal came from a thermistor placed in front of the nares and the third from the minimally invasive implanted thermistor.</s><s>The onset of downward deflections in the piezo signal was used to identify the beginning of chest expansion which corresponds to the beginning of inspiration.</s><s>A direct comparison of the piezo and extranasal thermistor traces shows that the extranasal thermistor was less precise at determining the beginning of inspiration due to the constant cooling of the probe by room-temperature air.</s><s>This led to consistently early estimates for the beginning of inspiration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; delay of -40.3 ± 27.4ms).</s><s>By comparison, respiration related temperature changes captured by the implanted thermistor more accurately reflected the correct moment of inspiration, with a delay of 5.4 ± 8.9ms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Frequency-dependent latency changes were subtle, and most apparent at low respiration frequencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Perhaps most importantly however, the response latency was not significantly altered by sniffing behavior, thus making the implanted thermistor appropriate for measurement of sniffing in a head-fixed preparation.</s></p><p><s>A direct comparison between the two thermistors showed highly synchronous detection of expiration onset, indicating a high degree of precision shared by both methods.</s><s>This was especially apparent during resting breathing (0.5 to 6Hz; standard deviation 4.6ms), which suggests that extranasal thermistors can be highly effective for acquiring respiration data non-invasively, if expiration is used as the reference point for analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of freely moving recording methods</head><p><s>Respiration signals from the minimally invasive implanted thermistor were readily recorded in freely moving mice and without movement related artifacts in 3 of the 3 tested mice (see e.g.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Direct comparison with simultaneously recorded plethysmography signals showed that the embedded thermistor signal reliably and accurately reflected respiration at all frequencies in the freely moving mice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of sniffing behavior</head><p><s>Sniffing behavior was effectively measured during odor presentation in 3 head-fixed mice.</s><s>The results obtained were very similar to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Wesson et al. (Wesson et al., 2008)</ref>, in several ways (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Mice responded to novel odors with sustained periods of highfrequency sniffing, whereas they responded to familiar odors with only brief, less pronounced increases in respiration frequency.</s><s>Additionally, odorants that were structurally similar to a repeated odorant elicited smaller increases in sniff frequency compared to structurally dissimilar odorants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, E5 and E6 versus Bz).</s><s>Lastly, mice also demonstrated characteristic dishabituation to a familiar odor following the presentation of the first novel odor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, sniffing after first E4).</s><s>Together, these results show that the minimally invasive thermistor implant is as effective a tool for the assessment of sniffing in response to odor as the pressure transducer connected to an intranasal sniff cannula employed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Wesson et al. (Wesson et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Current approaches to measuring mouse respiratory movements rely either on measuring temperature changes associated with inhaling cool air and exhaling air warmed up during passage through the airways and lungs, or they use miniature pressure transducers to measure respiration related pressure changes in the nasal cavity via implanted cannulae.</s><s>Placing a thermal probe directly in front of the nares is the least invasive method, but is only precise when used to detect the onset of expiration during resting breathing (&lt;6Hz).</s><s>Implanting thermistors into the nasal cavity gives reliable measurements at all frequencies but interferes with the airflow and irritates the sensitive lining of the nasal cavity.</s><s>Intranasal pressure measurements have the same drawbacks as they too require invasion of the nasal cavity with a small metal or plastic cannula and, in addition, add considerable weight to the nose and partially obstruct the visual field.</s><s>Another noteworthy approach employs a pressure sensor implanted into the thoracic cavity to detect changes in pressure associated with respiratory movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Reisert et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>This method is advantageous in that it does not cause damage to olfactory tissues.</s><s>However, the temporal precision with which inhalation onset times were detected declined considerably with decreasing respiratory frequency while precision of detection was stable across all frequencies for the minimally invasive thermistor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>In summary, this novel method of respiration monitoring in mice using minimally invasive thermistor implants is at least as reliable as current methods using implanted sensors, but without the drawbacks, such as obstruction of airflow or damage to the nasal epithelium.</s><s>Minimally invasive thermistor implants thus allow highly precise respiratory monitoring with reduced pain and stress for the animals and without interfering with natural breathing behavior.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Surgical placement of thermistor probe Left panel: Picture of thermistor insertion.</s><s>Dotted lines were added to highlight the locations of skull sutures used as landmarks for probe placement.</s><s>Triangle indicates the point from which stereotaxic coordinates were measured; the intersection of the sagittal suture and the posterior edge of the nasal bone.</s><s>Right panel: (Top left) High contrast image of soft tissues underlying the nasal bone.</s><s>Poor attachment to the bone creates a space in which a thermistor can be easily implanted.</s><s>(Right) Anatomy of a coronal section at this location.</s><s>Illustration based on coronal sections from (Barrios, Nunez et al. 2014).</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="10,101.64,62.00,468.72,239.34" type="bitmap" /></figure>
