<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Author Summary</head><p><s>To understand how neurons encode information, neuroscientists record their firing activity while the animal executes a given task for many trials.</s><s>Surprisingly, it has been found that the neural response is highly variable, which a priori limits the encoding of information by these neurons.</s><s>However, recent experiments have shown that this variability is reduced when the animal receives a stimulus or attends to a particular one, suggesting an enhancement of information encoding.</s><s>It is known that a cause of neural variability resides in the fact that individual neurons receive an input which fluctuates around their firing threshold.</s><s>We demonstrate here that all the experimental results can naturally arise from the dynamics of a neural network.</s><s>Using a realistic model, we show that the neural variability during spontaneous activity is particularly high because input noise induces large fluctuations between multiple -but unstable-network states.</s><s>With stimulation or attention, one particular network state is stabilized and fluctuations decrease, leading to a neural variability reduction.</s><s>In conclusion, our results suggest that the observed variability reduction is a property of the neural circuits of the brain.</s></p><p><s>difference as a function of the cohesion and inhibition levels.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and 3B show the results for the matched condition and for the non-matched condition, respectively.</s><s>Both cases show that a reduction of the Fano factor consistent with the experimental findings occurs around the bifurcation line (black line).</s><s>More precisely, the matched rate case shows that multistability is required for the Fano factor to change.</s><s>The Fano factor is reduced on the right part of the bifurcation line, for w Inh w1, requiring then sufficient inhibition.</s><s>For the non-matched rate case, the Fano factor is well reduced around the whole multistability region.</s><s>Note that, due to the presence of noise, multiple attractors manifest themselves outside the region calculated with the mean-field approach (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the Fano factor level for those regions is consistent with the observed experimental values, namely: around 1.4 for the non-stimulated case and 1 for the stimulated case.</s></p><p><s>Beyond the changes observed over trials, the spiking statistics, like the neural ISI distribution, is also likely to change under  together with the mean rate (red curves) for each population, obtained as the convolution of the spike trains with a unit Gaussian function with 50 ms width.</s><s>For the first 10 s, no stimulus is applied and the resulting ongoing activity is similar in all excitatory populations: in each of them, the firing rate fluctuates irregularly and abruptly as the result of input rate fluctuations and induced excursions between the different attractors of the network.</s><s>Besides an attractor corresponding to low activation in all populations, there are attractors corresponding to higher activation in one selective population and low activation in all the others.</s><s>From time t~10 s (green vertical line), a stimulus is presented to the selective excitatory population 1 (I~200 Hz), increasing its mean rate and decreasing the one of the other selective pools.</s><s>Moreover, all rates have now lower fluctuations: the attractor corresponding to a high activation of population 1 and a low activation of the others is stabilized.</s><s>(B) Probability distribution of the rate fluctuations for the specific excitatory populations during spontaneous activity.</s><s>The rate fluctuations are quite large (mean rate: 3:02 Hz;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attentional Effects</head><p><s>Recent experiments have studied the effect of attention on the neural variability over trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, Single V4 cells were recorded in awake behaving monkeys when one stimulus in the neuron's receptive field was behaviorally attended or not.</s><s>Both studies reported a relatively small but significant decrease of the Fano factor in the attended condition with respect to the non-attended one.</s><s>In our simulations, we modeled the attentional bias by increasing the level of exogenous input to the stimulus-specific population when this stimulus was attended, similar to an increase of the stimulus-related input.</s><s>In this sense, it can be regarded as a baseline shift mechanism, or an increase in contrast (However, it does not accommodate any attentional gain mechanism that would be better modeled through changes in postsynaptic sensitivity, possibly through NMDA receptor dynamics).</s><s>As the neural variability reduction increases with stimulus strength (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), the application of an attentional bias therefore decreases the Fano factor compared to the non-attended case.</s><s>The effect of attention on the Fano factor evolution in shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> by comparing with the non-attended case.</s><s>These results show that the model reproduces the range of Fano factor reductions observed experimentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As a model prediction, we consider now the case where two stimuli are presented simultaneously in a neuron's receptive field and when attention is allocated to only one of them, a situation referred to lead to ''biased competition'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>In the network, selective populations 1 and 2 encode each one of the two simultaneously presented visual stimuli: the target which should be attended and the distractor which should be ignored.</s><s>After 500 ms of spontaneous activity, the two external visual stimuli are applied to these two populations for 1000 ms.</s><s>In the attended condition, the selective population corresponding to the target receives the attentional bias.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> plots the neural variability reduction for the cohesion level w z ~1:9.</s><s>The variability reduction is obtained as the difference of the average Fano factor for the 80 neurons in the attended (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8A</ref>) versus in the non-attended stimulated populations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8B</ref>).</s><s>For both populations, variability is reduced by attention around the region where the system is multistable without attention (around w Inh ~1).</s><s>The mechanism responsible for the reduction of neural variability is identical to the one described above.</s><s>In the condition without attention noisedriven excursions between attractors generates a high neural variability.</s><s>Allocation of attention stabilizes one of the attractors, namely the one corresponding to higher activation of the attended target population and lower activation of the ignored distractor population.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the spontaneous or undriven state, why do cortical circuits exhibit a relatively high degree of neural variability across trials?</s><s>Why does this variability decrease when a stimulus is presented or when attention is paid?</s><s>Here, we investigated what could underlie these phenomena in a realistic neural network.</s><s>Our results show that, under spontaneous conditions, the high degree of neural variability in a neural circuit could essentially be due to fluctuation-driven excursions between the different attractors of the circuit dynamics.</s><s>This is possible if, in the parameter space, the spontaneous state of the circuit resides around the edge of a bifurcation above which multistable attractors appear.</s><s>The application of an external excitatory drive, either mediated by a sensory stimulus or by attention, stabilizes one specific attractor and suppresses in this way the transitions between the different attractors.</s><s>This results in a net decrease in neural variability as measured as a by the Fano factor.</s><s>More precisely, the matched rate case shows that multistability is required for the Fano factor to change.</s><s>The Fano factor is reduced on the right part of the bifurcation line, requiring then sufficient inhibition (w Inh w1).</s><s>For the non-matched rate case, the Fano factor is well reduced around the whole multistability region.</s><s>In conclusion our results show that, in the model parameter space, there exists a region where the Fano factor is reduced, both in the non-matched and the matched rate case.</s><s>Because the spike count signal-to-noise ratio is increased, this reduction suggests an improved encoding of the external signal.</s></p><p><s>Beyond the variability over trials, we have also shown that the CV of the neural ISI distributions varies similarly to the Fano factor across all conditions, meaning that the variability reduction is due to a concomitant increase of the spike trains regularity.</s><s>It would be interesting to verify this model prediction experimentally.</s><s>However, due to relatively short recorded time intervals, this quantity may be difficult to measure and the CV 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which requires only the knowledge of two consecutive ISIs, could be employed instead.</s></p><p><s>The above conclusions have been obtained for the present heterogeneously connected network and rely on the existence of multiple attractors.</s><s>However, the present scenario does not depend on the specific network structure, provided the network exhibits multistability.</s><s>In this case, there is a region of the parameter space where there is strict multistability, meaning the co-existence of multiple stable states.</s><s>From dynamical systems For a low cohesion level (w z ~1:7, left column), the reduction is lower, and even non-existent in the matched rate case, than for a larger cohesion level (w z ~2:3, right column) for which the multistability region exists.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.g004</s><s>theory, it is known that close to this region, the unstable attractors can still transiently attract the dynamics, a behavior which will be favored by fluctuations.</s><s>Note that, because multistability is needed here to reproduce the experimental observations, this excludes a priori single neuron mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>In a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, the authors have proposed that the ongoing spontaneous activity is chaotic, and that stimulation suppresses this chaos.</s><s>They use a phenomenological firing rate model which allows a theoretical understanding of the network behavior.</s><s>The realism of the present model allows a quantitative comparison with experimental results but prevents at the same time such a theoretical understanding.</s><s>Only could we predict the stationary states of the network using a mean-field approach.</s><s>Beyond the naı ¨ve analogy that stimulation suppresses ongoing fluctuations in the two models, a number of differences between the two models (in their case: rate model, no noise, temporal input, phase transition) indicate that the two scenarios are different.</s></p><p><s>Further experimental and theoretical evidence supports the present scenario.</s><s>At the microscopic level and using optical imaging, Arieli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) first showed that spontaneous activity is highly coordinated across large neural assemblies in the primary visual cortex (V1) of an anesthetized cat.</s><s>Furthermore, the pattern of co-activation is feature-specific in the discharge of individual neurons and is temporally locked to the activation of other cells with similar orientation preferences whose spatial organization is described by orientation maps.</s><s>Finally, the variability of such ongoing activity can explain much of the variability in subsequent sensory-evoked responses, indicating a potential link with perception.</s><s>Blumenfeld et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> accounted for this type of cellular ongoing activity by assuming that this activity resulted from noise-driven transitions between multistable attractors of the intracortical network.</s><s>They suggested a rate model endowed with a simple local connectivity rule, and showed that it yields attractor states that are highly similar to the orientation maps alternatively activated in the absence of stimulation.</s><s>They also considered the case where the activity is evoked by a visual stimulus and showed how a structured afferent input can select the orientation map that matches the orientation of the stimulus.</s><s>Their model therefore suggests that orientation maps are encoded in the lateral connections, and that these connections can generate an orientation map both when the activity is spontaneous and when it is evoked by a visual stimulus.</s></p><p><s>In a recent work, where the same biophysical spiking neural network was used, it was shown that, using the Fisher information, the network neural activity best encoded a small external input, or modulatory input (like it is believed to be the case for attention), in the region of the parameter space where excitatory and inhibitory input currents almost balance each other, and which correspond to w Inh &amp;1 (Deco and Hugues, PLoS One, in press).</s><s>This regime of balanced input is supported by experimental evidence in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Taken together with the present results, we can conclude that, in the region of the parameter space around the bifurcation and where input currents almost balance, our model agrees with all the experimental findings, which suggests that these observations may also correspond to a region of best stimulus encoding.</s></p><p><s>At the global level of large-scale neural systems, a broad body of experimental work, mainly using the BOLD fMRI hemodynamic response,
