<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing has been shown to be an essential event that plays a significant role in neuronal function, as well as innate immunity, in mammals.</s><s>It requires a structure that is largely double-stranded for catalysis but little is known about what determines editing efficiency and specificity in vivo.</s><s>We have previously shown that some editing sites require adjacent long stem loop structures acting as editing inducer elements (EIEs) for efficient editing.</s><s>Results: The glutamate receptor subunit A2 is edited at the Q/R site in almost 100% of all transcripts.</s><s>We show that efficient editing at the Q/R site requires an EIE in the downstream intron, separated by an internal loop.</s><s>Also, other efficiently edited sites are flanked by conserved, highly structured EIEs and we propose that this is a general requisite for efficient editing, while sites with low levels of editing lack EIEs.</s><s>This phenomenon is not limited to mRNA, as non-coding primary miRNAs also use EIEs to recruit ADAR to specific sites.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>We propose a model where two regions of dsRNA are required for efficient editing: first, an RNA stem that recruits ADAR and increases the local concentration of the enzyme, then a shorter, less stable duplex that is ideal for efficient and specific catalysis.</s><s>This discovery changes the way we define and determine a substrate for A-to-I editing.</s><s>This will be important in the discovery of novel editing sites, as well as explaining cases of altered editing in relation to disease.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Complex organisms require a great diversity of gene products for proper development and function, particularly in the brain.</s><s>This is achieved by the use of numerous co-or post-transcriptional processes, such as alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and RNA editing.</s><s>Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a highly conserved RNA modification process that occurs in all metazoan lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Inosine base pairs with C and is interpreted as G by the cellular machineries.</s><s>Hence, A-to-I RNA editing can be designated as an A-to-G conversion and, if situated in exonic sequence, it has the potential to alter codons and consequently contribute to the expression of additional protein isoforms (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>).</s><s>A-to-I conversions within introns and 3′ UTRs can also have an impact on the transcriptome, e.g., by creating new splice sites and changing miRNA target recognition.</s><s>A-to-I editing is essential to the organism and aberrant editing has been linked to a variety of different human diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurological disorders, several types of cancer, and autoimmune disorders such as the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>To understand what determines the level of editing in different substrates and under different circumstances, we need to know the mechanism of substrate recognition.</s><s>It is, however, still largely unclear what factors determine the efficiency of editing.</s></p><p><s>A-to-I RNA editing is performed by the adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) enzymes that recognize adenosines located in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to be deaminated into inosines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>ADAR proteins are evolutionarily conserved in metazoans and mammals have two enzymatically active ADAR enzymes, ADAR1 and ADAR2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In some cases, the substrate selectivity of the two enzymes overlaps, but more commonly the targets are specific for either enzyme <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>ADAR1 and ADAR2 share certain domain structures, such as the deaminase domain and the double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs).</s><s>However, the numbers of dsRBDs differ between the two enzymes (ADAR1 contains three while ADAR2 contains two) as well as the spacing between them.</s><s>The dsRBDs recognize one face of the sugar backbone of an A-form helix, such as the RNA duplex, spanning two minor grooves and an intervening major groove <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, there is little sequence specificity via interaction of the dsRBDs and theoretically they can interact with any double-stranded RNA longer than 16 nucleotides (nt).</s><s>However, sequence-specific interactions between the two dsRBDs of human ADAR2 at the GluA2 stem loop at the R/G site have been reported based on the NMR structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the deaminase domain also requires a doublestranded structure in order to interact with the substrate and perform the catalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In general, there are two categories of A-to-I RNA editing determined by the structure of the RNA.</s><s>Long double-stranded structures, commonly found in introns and 3′ UTRs, are subjected to hyper-editing of many adenosines in what appears to be a random manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Most of this type of editing occurs within inverted repeat elements, commonly within introns and non-coding sequences.</s><s>This is also the most common A-to-I editing event and human next-generation sequencing together with advanced computational methods has predicted up to 100 million sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>The other, more site-selective category is often present in shorter duplexes interrupted by bulges and internal loops and commonly occurs within coding regions.</s><s>These duplexes are often formed by base pairing between the exon sequence containing the editing site and an adjacent intron.</s><s>Site-selective A-to-I RNA editing is highly conserved and particularly prone to cause amino acid changes with functionality in neurotransmission-related genes (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>).</s><s>One of the most prominent selectively edited sites is located in the brain-specific GluA2 transcript, coding for the AMPA glutamate receptor.</s><s>The Q/R site in GluA2 is ADAR2-specific and edited in almost 100% of all transcripts in the adult mammalian brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Editing at this site results in an amino acid change from glutamine (Q) to arginine (R) that reduces the receptor permeability to Ca 2+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>This editing event is crucial for normal brain development and function, as shown by studies on ADAR2-deficient mice.</s><s>These mice develop severe epileptic seizures and die within three weeks after birth, mainly due to the lack of editing at the Q/R site <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is still not fully elucidated why the Q/R site is so remarkably prone to editing.</s></p><p><s>Another highly edited site changes a codon for isoleucine to methionine (I/M) in the Gabra-3 transcript, coding for the α3 subunit of the GABA A receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>We have previously shown that editing at the I/M site in exon 9 of Gabra-3 requires a conserved 149-nt long intronic sequence located downstream of the I/M editing site for efficient editing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>This intronic editing inducer element (EIE) forms a long double-stranded structure prone to hyper-editing.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we show that the efficiency of editing at the GluA2 Q/R site is dependent on a conserved 45 base pair (bp) long intronic stem structure acting as an EIE.</s><s>The EIE of GluA2 can also induce editing at other selectively edited sites and even increase the efficiency of editing at sites of low efficiency.</s><s>We further show that EIEs are commonly present adjacent to efficiently edited sites, while they are absent in proximity of sites of low editing efficiency.</s><s>Moreover, EIEs are not limited to sites within coding sequence; editing within non-coding RNA such as pri-miRNAs can also be induced by EIEs.</s><s>We therefore suggest that the use of EIEs is a general mechanism used by the enzyme to increase both editing specificity and efficiency.</s></p></div>

(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>).</s><s>As presented above, transient ADAR2 in HEK293 cells edited the Q/R site in 78% of the wild-type reporter.</s><s>Five other editing sites,

extended stem structure.</s><s>The change in editing efficiency and specificity after the removal of the internal loop was also seen in HeLa cells expressing endogenous ADAR (data not shown).</s><s>This result reveals that the internal loop limits the number of edited adenosines in the vicinity of the Q/R site, but it also contributes to editing efficiency at the Q/R site.</s></p><p><s>We next investigated the role of the double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) for editing specificity and selectivity.</s><s>Mutations from KKxxK to EAxxA in the two dsRBDs of ADAR2 were made to impair their RNA interaction as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>To compensate for the inefficient editing achieved with this mutant (data not

shown not to affect RNA binding in vitro.</s><s>This ADAR2-EAA-E488Q mutant expression vector was cotransfected with the GluA2 Q/R editing reporter (GA2Q/R) in HEK293 cells.</s><s>Although editing was much more inefficient at the Q/R site compared to using the wild-type enzyme-from 78 to 26% on average-the site selectivity persisted (Fig. <ref type="figure"

target="#fig_1">3b</ref>).</s><s>These editing levels may indicate that efficient editing can be achieved without the contribution of the dsRBDs.</s><s>Removing the internal loop in the transcript (GA2Q/R-Δloop) gave rise to promiscuous editing in a similar way as with the wildtype enzyme, although five sites in the intronic EIE were missing.</s><s>As a control, we also introduced E488Q as a single mutation in ADAR2.</s><s>ADAR2-E488Q increased editing at several sites in GA2Q/R compared to wild type, and the specificity was lost in a similar way as with ADAR2 wild -type after removal of the internal loop in co-transfections with the GA2Q/R-Δloop (Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3a</ref>).</s><s>Equal expression of the transiently expressed ADAR2 mutants and wild -type was analyzed by western blot (Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3b</ref>).</s><s>In conclusion, this result suggests that a basic low level of editing can be achieved without the contribution of the dsRBDs and that the deamination domain determines the selectivity.</s><s>Furthermore, the dsRBDs are required to achieve editing of high efficiency at the Q/R

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have previously shown that EIEs consisting of long stem loop structures can attract ADAR1 and ADAR2 to facilitate catalysis

mechanism to increase editing efficiency at specific sites in both coding and non-coding RNA.</s><s>Furthermore, the EIE is required to be detached from the specific editing site as a separate stem.</s><s>Our present data suggest that the editing enzyme utilizes large internal loops as helix ends to increase both selectivity and efficiency of editing at specific sites within coding sequence.</s><s>We propose that the ADAR enzymes recognize their substrates in two separate events: first they are attracted to a duplex structure that is ideal for protein binding but not necessarily for editing efficiency or specificity, then to an adjacent shorter duplex holding the specific editing site (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>The first event attracts the enzyme to a longer double-stranded region, which may be ideal for binding but not catalysis.</s><s>This will increase the local concentration of the enzyme at the substrate, inducing editing at a second site with a lower binding affinity.</s><s>The second site is more specific since it requires a certain nucleotide sequence, ideal for efficient catalysis but also with restraints on non-specific editing.</s></p><p><s>By in vitro analysis it has previously been shown that dsRNA flanked by internal loops larger than 6 nt are identified as helix ends by the ADAR1 enzyme, while smaller loops of up to 4 nt act as part of the helix <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Limiting the length of the helix by larger internal loops, forming a "barbell" structure, forces ADAR into the right position for efficient site-specific editing and removes the risk of receiving non-specific adjacent editing.</s><s>In our model, highly efficient site selective A-to-I editing within coding sequence commonly requires adjacent but separate double-stranded RNA structures that attract the editing enzyme to the substrate and thereby increase the local concentration of the protein.</s><s>To test this theory, we removed the internal loop of 30 nt separating the stem including the Q/R site in the GluA2 transcript from the longer intronic stem downstream.</s><s>Removal of the internal loop led to more promiscuous editing at several sites also within coding sequences (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, it also led to a dramatic decrease in editing by 50% at the specific Q/R site.</s><s>This result reveals that separate stem structures are required for recruitment and efficient catalysis.</s><s>Like other dsRNA binding enzymes such as PKR, Staufen, and Drosha, the ADAR enzymes are thought to interact promiscuously with dsRNA via their dsRNA binding domains, as they recognize the minor groove in the sugar-phosphate backbone of the RNA without any direct contact with the nucleotide bases <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, the ADAR editing enzymes have the potential to bind any base paired structure of RNA.</s><s>However, the two dsRBDs in ADAR2 have previously been shown to selectively bind to the stem at the Q/R site and also contribute to editing efficiency in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>It is therefore likely that the ADAR2 interaction at the Q/R site is different from the interaction with the downstream stem, which is also edited but with a lower efficiency.</s><s>To determine the role of the dsRBDs in editing efficiency and specificity in vivo, we analyzed the editing pattern of an ADAR2 enzyme with mutated dsRBDs on the GluA2 substrate.</s><s>This mutant is unable to bind RNA via its dsRBDs.</s><s>Similar to the in vitro analysis, editing efficiency was severely affected by the mutations in the dsRBDs.</s><s>Furthermore, no editing was detected in the absence of the EIE, indicating that this element is important for editing efficiency also in the absence of the dsRBDs (data not shown).</s><s>However, little difference in sites selected for editing by the dsRBD mutant could be detected compared to editing by wild-type ADAR2.</s><s>Nevertheless, the editing level of the +60 site is comparatively high in the dsRBD mutant, indicating that this is a primary docking site for ADAR2.</s><s>In summary, this indicates that the dsRBDs and deamination domain both contribute to recruitment and catalysis and that the dsRBDs contribute to a minor extent to site selectivity.</s></p><p><s>Co-crystallization of the ADAR2 deaminase domain together with an RNA substrate revealed that the deamination domain also specifically interacts with the RNA helix structure, covering 20 bp <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>During deamination, the catalytic site of the ADAR enzymes flips the adenosine out of the helix in order to make it accessible by the active site <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Specific residues of the ADAR2 protein are in contact with the RNA during deamination, which also offers an explanation for the difference in substrate selectivity between ADAR1 and ADAR2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the co-crystal structure also reveals the preference for the 5′ and 3′ nearest neighbor of the edited adenosine, explained by interactions with the catalytic ADAR2 domain during the base-flipping reaction.</s><s>Limiting the positioning of the ADAR protein, either by a short stem loop or by internal loops in a longer stem structure, facilitates specificity and efficiency but is not necessarily the most efficient way of attracting the enzyme to the substrate.</s></p><p><s>In mouse and human, editing has been shown to be regulated within both non-coding RNA and gene 7 A model for efficient site selective A-to-I editing using an editing inducer element (EIE).</s><s>The process of efficient editing occurs as two consecutive events: 1) ADAR (in blue) recognizes a longer intronic stem by a non-specific interaction; 2) when the

nearly 100% of all transcripts, while editing of GluK2 at the Q/R site reaches over 80% editing in the adult mouse brain and Gabra-3 over 90% <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>We define both of these categories as high efficiency sites and found editing inducer elements adjacent to all the efficiently edited sites within coding regions analyzed (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Efficient enzyme recruitment may therefore explain their high efficiency of editing in adult tissue and indicates that the presence of EIEs is a general mechanism used to increase the efficiency of editing at specific sites.</s><s>Editing at the Q/R site in GluA2 is, however, highly efficient also in the embryonic brain where GluK2 and Gabra-3 editing is barely detected.</s><s>The high level of GluA2 Q/R editing in the embryo might be explained by a higher affinity of the ADAR2 enzyme to this site than to other sites of editing.</s><s>Recent data from our laboratory indicate that concentrations of the ADAR2 enzyme are lower in the nucleus of premature embryonic neurons than mature neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>A-to-I editing is a nuclear event and is therefore dependent on the level of nuclear ADAR.</s><s>By transient transfection of ADAR2 we show that an extremely low level of ADAR2 is required for efficient editing at the Q/R site of GluA2 but only in the presence of the EIE.</s><s>Our result gives a plausible explanation to the enigma of how GluA2 Q/R editing can be edited to 100% while other sites are unedited in the embryonic brain.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, we also show that EIEs can induce editing in non-coding RNA.</s><s>We and others have shown that several miRNAs in one specific cluster (miR379-410) in
