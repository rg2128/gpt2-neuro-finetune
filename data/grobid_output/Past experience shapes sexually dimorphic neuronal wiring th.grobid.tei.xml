<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>stress.</s><s>While a number of stressors had no effect on male-specific synapse pruning (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref>), starvation of males (but not hermaphrodites) at early juvenile stages fully recapitulated the impact of dauer passage on male-specific synapse pruning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1d</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, starvation during the L4 stage did not result in defects in male-specific synaptic pruning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1d</ref>).</s><s>Synaptic pruning is first observable in the L4 stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4</ref> , demonstrating that starvation prevents pruning if the stress occurs before its onset, but does not halt or reverse synaptic pruning.</s></p><p><s>The PHB phasmid sensory neurons modulate the avoidance response to noxious chemicals (e.g.</s><s>SDS) via synapses onto the AVA command interneurons in juvenile animals of both sexes, as well as adult hermaphrodites; in adult males, pruning of the PHB&gt;AVA synaptic contacts eliminates this behavioral output <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> .</s><s>Juvenile-starved adult males retain the ability to respond to SDS, as predicted by the failure to prune PHB&gt;AVA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2a</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, males starved during adulthood (after pruning had already occurred) do not show any change in SDS avoidance behavior ("adult starved," Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2a</ref>), consistent with normal PHB&gt;AVA pruning.</s><s>Thus, a starvation experience allows males to retain juvenile sensory acuity, and results in the loss of an adult behavioral sexual dimorphism.</s><s>However, maintenance of juvenile sensory acuity affects other behaviors in the adult male.</s><s>Adult males differ from adult hermaphrodites in that they search for, and mate with, hermaphrodites <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7</ref> .</s><s>Following juvenile starvation, males display a defect in maintaining contact with hermaphrodites during mating, a phenotype previously associated with AVA ablation (the command interneuron postsynaptic to both PHA and PHB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2b</ref>).</s><s>Overall, adverse juvenile experience prevents male-specific synaptic pruning and increases noxious sensory responsiveness, but also decreases male mating efficiency.</s></p><p><s>In C. elegans, several feeding-dependent behaviors such as locomotion and aversive memory are known to be modulated by the monoamines serotonin and octopamine, wherein serotonin signals well-fed conditions (similar to vertebrates) and octopamine (similar to norepinephrine in vertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9</ref> ) signals starvation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11</ref> .</s><s>To investigate whether monoamine signaling regulates male-specific synaptic pruning, we supplemented well-fed animals with exogenous octopamine during the L1 stage and found that this indeed mimicked starvation, suppressing male-specific synaptic pruning of the PHB&gt;AVA and PHA&gt;AVG connections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3a</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, starving L1 animals in the presence of exogenous serotonin fully rescued male pruning of the PHB&gt;AVA and PHA&gt;AVG connections, in addition to restoring the SDS avoidance behavioral dimorphism (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2a,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">3a</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with this result, pruning was also rescued in males that were starved in the presence of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine or in mod-5/SERT mutants, both known to increase extracellular serotonin <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>No pruning defects were observed in males defective for dopamine production (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The effects of exogenous octopamine and serotonin on pruning suggest a role for monoamine signaling in regulating male-specific synaptic pruning but do not address requirement of endogenous octopamine and serotonin.</s><s>Therefore, we examined expression levels of the rate-limiting enzymes of octopamine and serotonin synthesis.</s><s>In larval C. elegans, octopamine is produced exclusively in the sex-shared RIC interneuron class by tyramine-β-hydroxylase (tbh-1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with our results with exogenous octopamine treatment, starvation at either the adult <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14</ref> or L1 stage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3c</ref>) increases transcription of tbh-1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3c</ref>, Extended Data Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4a</ref>).</s><s>The expression of the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (tph-1), is also dependent on starvation, at least in adult animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> , with an octopamine receptor conveying the starvation signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> .</s><s>At the first larval stage, tph-1 is exclusively expressed in two sex-shared classes of serotonin-producing neurons, the bilateral NSM and ADF neuron pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> .</s><s>Under well-fed conditions, a tph-1 fosmid reporter was dimorphically expressed in both NSM and ADF, with L1 males showing higher levels of expression than hermaphrodites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4b</ref>).</s><s>Upon L1 starvation, tph-1 expression acutely decreases in male ADF, but not NSM, neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4b</ref>).</s><s>Addition of exogenous octopamine to otherwise well-fed animals mimicked the effect of starvation on tph-1 transcription in male ADF neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3d</ref>), whereas the addition of tyramine did not (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4c</ref>).</s><s>Confirming the effects observed with a tph-1 reporter transgene, single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) of endogenous tph-1 mRNA also revealed sexually dimorphic expression in ADF, as well as its transcriptional decrease following L1 starvation (and a lack of tph-1 downregulation in NSM) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Unlike the upregulation of the octopamine producing tbh-1 gene, downregulation of tph-1 reporter expression persisted even after animals were returned to food (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, in continuously-fed animals, tph-1 expression peaks during the L3 stage in both sexes (the onset of sexual maturation), while tbh-1 expression is unchanged over the course of development (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Strikingly, this upregulation never occurs in L1-starved animals, and this starvation memory is dependent on tbh-1 and thus, octopamine production (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5a</ref>).</s><s>We also observed decreased tph-1 transcription in ADF but not NSM during the L3 stage in SER-6 octopamine receptor mutants, corroborating the relevance of octopamine signaling for regulating serotonin levels during sexual maturation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5b</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, exogenous serotonin did not suppress the tbh-1 upregulation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5c</ref>).</s><s>Demonstrating the functional relevance of persistent serotonin downregulation, male-specific pruning defects in L1starved animals were rescued by supplementing with exogenous serotonin during the L3 stage (after the animals had been returned to food; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6a</ref>).</s><s>We conclude that a temporary increase in starvation-induced octopamine production triggers a long-term alteration in serotonin production.</s></p><p><s>To further examine whether levels of serotonin production in the sex-shared ADF neuron regulate sex-specific synaptic pruning during male sexual maturation, we also used neuronspecific promoters to overexpress tph-1 in NSM or ADF during L1 starvation.</s><s>tph-1 overexpression in ADF, but not in NSM, rescued sex-specific pruning of PHB&gt;AVA and PHA&gt;AVG in males that had been starved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3e</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Through selective removal of serotonin production from either NSM or ADF neurons (using cellspecific tph-1 mutant rescue experiments and genetic elimination of either NSM or ADF; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3f</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>,e), we found that serotonin production specifically in ADF is not only sufficient but required to modulate neuronal male-specific synaptic maturation.</s><s>This analysis also revealed an earlier role of NSM-secreted serotonin in phasmid neuron migration and morphology (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To ask how serotonin signals from the ADF head neurons to the phasmid&gt;interneuron connections in the tail, we analyzed PHA&gt;AVG and/or PHB&gt;AVA connectivity in males mutant for each of the four metabotropic serotonin receptors in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref> .</s><s>In well-fed males lacking the ser-4/5HT1A receptor, juvenile synaptic connectivity was maintained, phenocopying juvenile starvation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7a</ref>).</s><s>This phenotype was neither enhanced by juvenile starvation nor rescued by exogenous serotonin in ser-4 mutants, suggesting that the ser-4 serotonin receptor acts directly and non-redundantly downstream of the feeding cue (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8a</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, tph-1 transcription levels were unaffected in the ser-4 mutant, confirming that ser-4 does not feed back onto serotonin production itself (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In both C. elegans and vertebrates, ser-4/5HT1A responds to extrasynaptic serotonergic signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> , raising the possibility that serotonin from ADF might directly modulate phasmid connectivity.</s><s>Using smFISH probes against the ser-4 mRNA, we identified ser-4 transcripts in several neurons, including PHB but not PHA neurons, and detected no signals in ser-4 mutants (confirming probe specificity) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether ser-4 exerts its role neuron-autonomously within the phasmid sensory circuit, we performed cell-specific rescue experiments.</s><s>We found that AVA-driven ser-4 was unable to rescue PHB&gt;AVA pruning in ser-4 mutants but expressing ser-4 in PHB rescued the pruning defect, consistent with a cell-autonomous function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Serotonin signaling can also act cell non-autonomously in the phasmids to modulate synaptic pruning.</s><s>Specifically, we found that PHB-expressed ser-4 rescued pruning of the PHA&gt;AVG connection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7a</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, although we found that ser-4 is expressed in the PHB but not PHA neurons, expression of ser-4 in PHA rescued the PHA&gt;AVG pruning defect (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7a</ref>).</s><s>The extensive, male-specific gap junctional connections of the PHA and PHB neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4</ref> may allow PHA and PHB to readily cross-communicate a signal from a serotonin receptor.</s></p><p><s>Early-life stress is known to have long-lasting effects in vertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> , also involving serotonin signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> .</s><s>For example, prenatal stress in mouse models for human serotonin transporter variants affects adult memory, anxiety, and depressive-like behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref> .</s><s>Yet while both behavioral effects and some molecular effects of early-life stress in vertebrates have been identified, it has been difficult to link specific molecular changes to corresponding behavioral outcomes, a notion further confounded by complex contributions of genetic background <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> .</s><s>Here we show that a juvenile starvation stress results in lasting circuit and behavioral effects in adult male, but not hermaphrodite, C. elegans by affecting serotonin levels during sexual maturation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4d</ref>).</s><s>We find that serotonin normally signals extrasynaptically to act as a cue for male-specific synaptic pruning.</s><s>This provides insight into both how temporary early-life stress can result in specific lasting changes to the nervous system and how stress can intersect with sexual maturation and result in differential effects between the two sexes, a feature that has also been observed in vertebrate models <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> .</s><s>We anticipate that still-unknown genetic components underlying the many differences in sexual maturation between the two sexes of both C. elegans and vertebrates will shed light on the sexually differential sensitivity to juvenile starvation and other early-life stress.</s></p></div>

(e) tph-1 overexpression in ADF mimics the rescuing effect of exogenous 5HT. Quantification of PHB&gt;AVA and PHA&gt;AVG synaptic connectivity using GRASP and iBLINC. Two independent transgenic lines were tested for each experiment, L1 starved animals without transgenic lines are siblings of transgenic animals, controls are non-starved adult males with transgenic arrays.
