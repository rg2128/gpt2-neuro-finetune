three times (10 min per day) before training.</s><s>Mice then received 2 training sessions per week for 3 weeks to ensure strong and stable odor-shock association.</s><s>Each odor œ© shock training session consisted of 5 trials of 10 s odor conditioned stimulus coterminating with a 0.25 s, 0.4 mA footshock, presented with an average 120 s intertrial interval (ITI) (range 90 -150 s).</s></p><p><s>In Experiment 1, one group (n œ≠ 6 mice, 10 glomeruli) received odor (acetophenone) œ© shock pairing while a second group (n œ≠ 6 mice, 10 glomeruli) remained in the home cage and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased M71 axon density and glomerular size with fear conditioning using acetophenone</head><p><s>Although olfactory fear conditioning can be accomplished in as little as one training session <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cousens and Otto, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Paschall and Davis, 2002)</ref>, the experimental design was to optimize the robustness and stability of any possible learning adaptations by conditioning the mice to thirty total trials of acetophenone paired with shock spread over 3 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref>).</s><s>After the 3 week training period, brains were collected and stained with X-gal, to label and analyze M71 (LacZ-positive) glomeruli from the bulb surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>M71 glomerular area, quantified from the surface of the bulbs, was significantly larger in trained than in homecage mice, p œΩ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>Alone, this could be the result of differences in the nature of axon paths ranging over the surface of the bulb, rather than an actual increase in axonal innervation.</s><s>To address this, we quantified the cross-sectional area of each glomerulus, where glomeruli from odor-trained mice were also larger than those from homecage mice, *p œΩ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased glomerular size requires associative olfactory learning</head><p><s>It was unclear whether the increase in glomerular size was due to odor exposure alone (a nonspecific result of olfactory enrichment), or was specific to the odor-shock association.</s><s>To address this, in Experiment 2, we measured M71 glomerular crosssectional area in mice receiving acetophenone œ© shock pairings versus those that received acetophenone exposures alone without shocks, and homecage handled mice.</s><s>Glomerular cross-sectional area was larger in the acetophenone œ© shock group than either the acetophenone-alone or the homecage groups (F (2,43) œ≠ 6.99, p œΩ 0.01, post hoc Tukey tests, p œΩ 0.01 for acetophenone œ© shock vs homecage, and p œΩ 0.05 for acetophenone œ© shock vs acetophenone-alone) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 A</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased glomerular size requires pairing with an M71-specific odor</head><p><s>It was unknown whether stress from shocks may generally increase olfactory representations, independent of the specific nature of the acetophenone-receptive pathway.</s><s>Furthermore, olfactory learning may lead to overall increases in glomerular size or innervation regardless of the odorant specificity.</s><s>To test these hypotheses in Experiment 3, a propanol œ© shock training group was added, since propanol activates areas of the bulb distinct from acetophenone (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, available at www. jneurosci.org</s><s>as supplemental material) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Johnson and Leon, 2000)</ref>, and would control both for the specificity of the odorant, as well as the effect of receiving shocks not associated with acetophenone.</s><s>The mice differentially learned either acetophenone œ© shock or propanol œ© shock associations (interaction: F (1,22) œ≠ 20, p œΩ 0.001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 B</ref>), showing that acetophenone and propanol are perceptually different to a mouse and that both can support fear conditioning.</s><s>These robust discrimination training results were similar to our previous behavioral findings using acetophenone and amyl acetate <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jones et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Following training, the acetophenone œ© shock trained group had larger glomerular cross-sectional areas compared with the propanol œ© shock, acetophenone alone, and homecage control groups F (3,39) œ≠ 9.91, p œΩ 0.001, post hoc Tukey tests p œΩ 0.05 for each group versus acetophenone œ© shock (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased glomerular size is associated with increased number of olfactory sensory neurons</head><p><s>We hypothesized that increased glomerular size was due to an increase in the number of M71 receptor-expressing OSNs.</s><s>To test this, M71 OSNs (LacZ-positive) were quantified within the olfactory epithelium of acetophenone œ© shock trained and homecage no-odor control mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The acetophenone-trained mice had a higher number of LacZ-positive OSNs than the homecage controls, p œΩ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>There was also a correlation between the number of M71-specific olfactory neurons and the cross-sectional areas of M71 glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, Pearson's correlation coefficient œ≠ 0.62, F (1,13) œ≠ 7.62, p œΩ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Massed olfactory training results in long-lasting glomerular size increases</head><p><s>In Experiment 4, we investigated whether it was the number of trainings or length of the overall training period that determined the increase in glomerular area.</s><s>Thus we compared 3 weeks of spaced training to the same number of acetophenone œ© shock pairings provided over 3 consecutive training days, followed by 2.5 weeks without intervention.</s><s>Three weeks after the onset of training, glomerular area was greater in the 3 d and 3 weeks acetophenone œ© shock trained groups versus homecage (main effect of training: F (2,83) œ≠ 10.74, p œΩ 0.001, post hoc Tukey tests, p œΩ 0.05 vs homecage) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appetitive olfactory conditioned place preference results in similar glomerular size increases</head><p><s>Finally, we hypothesized that an alternate type of olfactorydependent emotional learning may also lead to glomerular adaptation.</s><s>Experiment 5 aimed to investigate whether appetitive learning from acetophenone-cocaine paired CPP would lead to similar adaptations as the aversive fear learning described above.</s><s>M71-IRES-LacZ mice were trained in the cocaine conditioned place preference task, with M71-activating acetophenone, or no odor, in the reinforced chamber.</s><s>These mice learned CPP by spending more time in the cocaine paired side post-training with either no odor, or acetophenone paired with the cocaine (main effect of test, F (1,13) œ≠ 10.64, p œΩ 0.05, post hoc Tukey tests, p œΩ 0.05 vs pretrained), but there was no effect of odor on cocaine CPP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the odor is not directly required for the CPP behavior.</s><s>Notably, 3 weeks following this appetitive learning task, the cocaine œ© acetophenone paired mice had increased glomerular area compared with the no odor CPP-trained mice, t test, p œΩ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 D</ref>).</s><s>We think that it is likely that the olfactory learning occurred in parallel with the place preference learning, but that we are at a "ceiling effect" of CPP.</s><s>We expect that other measures of olfactory sensitivity would show differences between the group.</s><s>Overall, these data demonstrate that appetitive olfactory learning supports enhanced M71 representations within the olfactory bulb as well as aversive olfactory learning.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In summary, we demonstrated that an M71-specific odor (acetophenone) paired with fear conditioning increased the size of M71 glomeruli.</s><s>This result suggests that the primary olfactory sensory pathway in adult mice is capable of learning-dependent struc- tural plasticity.</s><s>Additionally, we confirmed that odor-exposure alone is insufficient for the increases in glomerular size, but that olfactory-dependent associative learning was necessary.</s><s>We then found that the increased representation of M71 odorant receptor-specific glomeruli was due to the specific associative learning process produced by pairing acetophenone with shock, and not due to nonspecific effects of shock.</s><s>Importantly, this experiment also demonstrated that odorshock associative learning with a non-M71 activating odorant (propanol) does not lead to increased M71 sensory representation within the olfactory bulb.</s><s>Interestingly, analyses at the level of the olfactory epithelium indicated that the increase in M71 glomerular size was a result of increased number of M71-specific sensory neurons within the olfactory epithelium.</s><s>We next determined that 3 consecutive days of olfactory dependent fear training replicated the glomerular plasticity observed over 3 weeks of training, which also suggests that the increase in glomerular area is long-lasting, remaining for at least 3 weeks following the 3 d training regimen.</s><s>Therefore, we hypothesized that 3 consecutive days of CPP training would also lead to changes in glomerular size 3 weeks later.</s><s>In the final experiment, we demonstrated that long-lasting glomerular plasticity in adult mice can occur with both appetitive and aversive associative olfactory learning.</s></p><p><s>These data suggest that the olfactory system is dynamically regulated, even at the level of the primary sensory pathway, in an activity-dependent manner in adult mice.</s><s>These odor-specific adaptations occur with associative learning in a way that does not depend on odor exposure alone, nonspecific odor learning, shock-stress, or handling procedures.</s><s>The final experiment with cocaine-mediated CPP demonstrates that the valence of the emotional learning is unlikely the crucial factor in glomerular plasticity, but instead it is potentially the emotional salience.</s><s>Finally, the data suggest that the learning-dependent changes we find in the olfactory bulb are accompanied by an increased number of odorant-specific neurons in the olfactory epithelium.</s><s>Although glomerular enlargement with olfactory stimulation has been observed in developing young rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Coopersmith and Leon, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Woo et al., 1987)</ref> or in insect models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Faber et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sachse et al., 2007)</ref>, this study is novel in the demonstration of glomerular plasticity not just following olfactory stimulation, but after olfactory-dependent associative learning, in the adult mammalian olfactory system.</s></p><p><s>Since OSNs periodically die off and are replaced, the cell number increase in the olfactory epithelium could indicate a learningdependent increase in neurogenesis of the M71 neurons.</s><s>However, given that odorant receptor specificity is thought to be determined postmitotically by an irreversible stochastic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Li et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shykind et al., 2004)</ref>, such a selective neurogenesis would require the CNS to influence OR gene expression in immature neurons by a yet undiscovered mechanism.</s><s>Alternatively, longer survival time may exist for the M71 neurons, perhaps through learning-dependent release of neurotrophins from the olfactory bulb.</s><s>This hypothesis seems more likely since mature OSNs have neurotrophin receptor-expressing axon projections to the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Roskams et al., 1996)</ref> and the connection to OB is known to be required for OSN survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schwob et al., 1992)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results may explain enhanced odorant sensitivity and increased intranasal olfactory-evoked responses to repetitive odorant exposure as has been demonstrated in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wang et al., 1993)</ref>, rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Youngentob and Kent, 1995)</ref> and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wang et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>These increased odor responses were seen after 23-90 d, approximately equal or longer than our own protocol.</s><s>Of course, more rapid changes in odor perception might be associated with higher olfactory areas and may not require this mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Li et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The data may also explain multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome, in which a person becomes extremely hypersensitive to certain odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bell et al., 1992)</ref>.</s><s>This idiopathic disorder is thought to occur with aversive olfactory experience and subsequent odor sensitization.</s><s>Our data suggest a hypothesis that in such patients, aversive olfactory experiences may lead to enhanced structural representation and sensitivity of specific olfactory receptor pathways at the primary sensory level.</s><s>Finally this phenomenon, occurring at the primary olfactory synapse, will provide a very powerful model of adult learning-dependent plasticity, in which differential cues within the same modality can differentially modify structural representation.</s><s>This approach also provides a powerful tool for examination of top-down regulation of sensory systems.</s><s>For example, our group has shown that acquisition, but not expression, of olfactory-mediated fearconditioning is blocked by local infusion of NMDA antagonists into the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Walker et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, we can now test whether the primary sensory changes we have seen in the current experiments are also amygdala-dependent.</s><s>If so, this would provide a striking example of how the amygdala can modulate learning-dependent plasticity in different brain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McGaugh, 2004)</ref>, in this case, perhaps via direct centrifugal projections to the olfactory bulb and/or via amygdala-dependent modulation of monoamine cell groups that project to the bulb.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
