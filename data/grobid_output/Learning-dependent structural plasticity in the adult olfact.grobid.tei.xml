<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Animals. Adult male M71-IRES-tauLacZ transgenic mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vassalli et al., 2002)</ref> maintained in mixed 129/Sv ϫ C57BL/6 background (Jackson Laboratories) were used in all studies, except adult male C57BL/6J mice were used to test acetophenone versus propanol discrimination.</s><s>Mice were housed in a temperature controlled vivarium on a 12 h light/dark cycle in standard group cages (Յ5/cage) and were given ad libitum access to food and water.</s><s>All experiments were performed during the light cycle and approved by Emory University Institutional Review Board following National Institutes of Health Internal Animal Care and Use Committee standards.</s></p><p><s>Fear training and testing.</s><s>Fear training and testing were conducted using startle

three times (10 min per day) before training.</s><s>Mice then received 2 training sessions per week for 3 weeks to ensure strong and stable odor-shock association.</s><s>Each odor ϩ shock training session consisted of 5 trials of 10 s odor conditioned stimulus coterminating with a 0.25 s, 0.4 mA footshock, presented with an average 120 s intertrial interval (ITI) (range 90 -150 s).</s></p><p><s>In Experiment 1, one group (n ϭ 6 mice, 10 glomeruli) received odor (acetophenone) ϩ shock pairing while a second group (n ϭ 6 mice, 10 glomeruli) remained in the home cage and

by 90 s ITIs.</s><s>Each odor-startle trial consisted of a 10 s odor presentation coterminated with 50 ms, 105 dB noise burst.</s><s>For each animal, a fearpotentiated startle score was computed by subtracting the mean of the startle-alone trials from the mean of the odor-startle trials.</s><s>In Experiment 3, we compared M71-lacZ mice that received acetophenone ϩ shock training (n ϭ 4 mice, 13

described above (n ϭ 5 mice, 19 glomeruli), with mice that were trained to the same number of acetophenone odor-shock pairings over 3 consecutive days (10 odor-shock pairings per training session per day) (n ϭ 6 mice, 16 glomeruli), and with home cage control mice (n ϭ 14 mice, 51 glomeruli).</s></p><p><s>Olfactory conditioned place preference training.</s><s>Conditioned place preference (CPP) apparatuses (Med Associates) each consisted of 2 conditioning chambers (black with rod floor and white with mesh floor) connected by a central chamber with vertical sliding manual doors.</s><s>Using

compartment.</s></p><p><s>To investigate whether the M71-IRES-LacZ mice may demonstrate glomerular plasticity to appetitive learning, in Experiment 5, adult male mice were trained for cocaine CPP with acetophenone (n ϭ 7 mice, 18 glomeruli) or without the presence of acetophenone pairing with cocaine (n ϭ 8 mice, 26 glomeruli).</s></p><p><s>The mice received pretraining test for individual

cocaine-paired session [10 mg/kg of cocaine-hydrochloride IP (Sigma) dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline] in the white chamber, and one saline vehicle-pairing session in the black chamber (distributed and alternating between 9:00 and 11:00 A.M. and 2:00 and 4:00 P.M.) for 30 min.</s></p><p><s>The day after the completion of CPP training, all mice received posttraining test (identical to pretraining test), in which animals were allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 20 min.</s><s>CPP data were calculated as percent time spent on cocaine-paired chamber over the total

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased M71 axon density and glomerular size with fear conditioning using acetophenone</head><p><s>Although olfactory fear conditioning can be accomplished in as little as one training session <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cousens and Otto, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Paschall and Davis, 2002)</ref>, the experimental design was to optimize the robustness and stability of any possible learning adaptations by conditioning the mice to thirty total trials of acetophenone paired with shock spread over 3 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref>).</s><s>After the 3 week training period, brains were collected and stained with X-gal, to label and analyze M71 (LacZ-positive) glomeruli from the bulb surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>M71 glomerular area, quantified from the surface of the bulbs, was significantly larger in trained than in homecage mice, p Ͻ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>Alone, this could be the result of differences in the nature of axon paths ranging over the surface of the bulb, rather than an actual increase in axonal innervation.</s><s>To address this, we quantified the cross-sectional area of each glomerulus, where glomeruli from odor-trained mice were also larger than those from homecage mice, *p Ͻ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased glomerular size requires associative olfactory learning</head><p><s>It was unclear whether the increase in glomerular size was due to odor exposure alone (a nonspecific result of olfactory enrichment), or was specific to the odor-shock association.</s><s>To address this, in Experiment 2, we measured M71 glomerular crosssectional area in mice receiving acetophenone ϩ shock pairings versus those that received acetophenone exposures alone without shocks, and homecage handled mice.</s><s>Glomerular cross-sectional area was larger in the acetophenone ϩ shock group than either the acetophenone-alone or the homecage groups (F (2,43) ϭ 6.99, p Ͻ 0.01, post hoc Tukey tests, p Ͻ 0.01 for acetophenone ϩ shock vs homecage, and p Ͻ 0.05 for acetophenone ϩ shock vs acetophenone-alone) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 A</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased glomerular size requires pairing with an M71-specific odor</head><p><s>It was unknown whether stress from shocks may generally increase olfactory representations, independent of the specific nature of the acetophenone-receptive pathway.</s><s>Furthermore, olfactory learning may lead to overall increases in glomerular size or innervation regardless of the odorant specificity.</s><s>To test these hypotheses in Experiment 3, a propanol ϩ shock training group was added, since propanol activates areas of the bulb distinct from acetophenone (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, available at www. jneurosci.org</s><s>as supplemental material) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Johnson and Leon, 2000)</ref>, and would control both for the specificity of the odorant, as well as the effect of receiving shocks not associated with acetophenone.</s><s>The mice differentially learned either acetophenone ϩ shock or propanol ϩ shock associations (interaction: F (1,22) ϭ 20, p Ͻ 0.001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 B</ref>), showing that acetophenone and propanol are perceptually different to a mouse and that both can support fear conditioning.</s><s>These robust discrimination training results were similar to our previous behavioral findings using acetophenone and amyl acetate <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jones et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Following training, the acetophenone ϩ shock trained group had larger glomerular cross-sectional areas compared with the propanol ϩ shock, acetophenone alone, and homecage control groups F (3,39) ϭ 9.91, p Ͻ 0.001, post hoc Tukey tests p Ͻ 0.05 for each group versus acetophenone ϩ shock (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased glomerular size is associated with increased number of olfactory sensory neurons</head><p><s>We hypothesized that increased glomerular size was due to an increase in the number of M71 receptor-expressing OSNs.</s><s>To test this, M71 OSNs (LacZ-positive) were quantified within the olfactory epithelium of acetophenone ϩ shock trained and homecage no-odor control mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The acetophenone-trained mice had a higher number of LacZ-positive OSNs than the homecage controls, p Ͻ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>There was also a correlation between the number of M71-specific olfactory neurons and the cross-sectional areas of M71 glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, Pearson's correlation coefficient ϭ 0.62, F (1,13) ϭ 7.62, p Ͻ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Massed olfactory training results in long-lasting glomerular size increases</head><p><s>In Experiment 4, we investigated whether it was the number of trainings or length of the overall training period that determined the increase in glomerular area.</s><s>Thus we compared 3 weeks of spaced training to the same number of acetophenone ϩ shock pairings provided over 3 consecutive training days, followed by 2.5 weeks without intervention.</s><s>Three weeks after the onset of training, glomerular area was greater in the 3 d and 3 weeks acetophenone ϩ shock trained groups versus homecage (main effect of training: F (2,83) ϭ 10.74, p Ͻ 0.001, post hoc Tukey tests, p Ͻ 0.05 vs homecage) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appetitive olfactory conditioned place preference results in similar glomerular size increases</head><p><s>Finally, we hypothesized that an alternate type of olfactorydependent emotional learning may also lead to glomerular adaptation.</s><s>Experiment 5 aimed to investigate whether appetitive learning from acetophenone-cocaine paired CPP would lead to similar adaptations as the aversive fear learning described above.</s><s>M71-IRES-LacZ mice were trained in the cocaine conditioned place preference task, with M71-activating acetophenone, or no odor, in the reinforced chamber.</s><s>These mice learned CPP by spending more time in the cocaine paired side post-training with either no odor, or acetophenone paired with the cocaine (main effect of test, F (1,13) ϭ 10.64, p Ͻ 0.05, post hoc Tukey tests, p Ͻ 0.05 vs pretrained), but there was no effect of odor on cocaine CPP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the odor is not directly required for the CPP behavior.</s><s>Notably, 3 weeks following this appetitive learning task, the cocaine ϩ acetophenone paired mice had increased glomerular area compared with the no odor CPP-trained mice, t test, p Ͻ 0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 D</ref>).</s><s>We think that it is likely that the olfactory learning occurred in parallel with the place preference learning, but that we are at a "ceiling effect" of CPP.</s><s>We expect that other measures of olfactory sensitivity would show differences between the group.</s><s>Overall, these data demonstrate that appetitive olfactory learning supports enhanced M71 representations within the olfactory bulb as well as aversive olfactory learning.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In summary, we demonstrated that an M71-specific odor (acetophenone) paired with fear conditioning increased the size of M71 glomeruli.</s><s>This result suggests that the primary olfactory sensory pathway in adult mice is capable of learning-dependent struc- tural plasticity.</s><s>Additionally, we confirmed that odor-exposure alone is insufficient for the increases in glomerular size, but that olfactory-dependent associative learning was necessary.</s><s>We then found that the increased representation of M71 odorant receptor-specific glomeruli was due to the specific associative learning process produced by pairing acetophenone with shock, and not due to nonspecific effects of shock.</s><s>Importantly, this experiment also demonstrated that odorshock associative learning with a non-M71 activating odorant (propanol) does not lead to increased M71 sensory representation within the olfactory bulb.</s><s>Interestingly, analyses at the level of the olfactory epithelium indicated that the increase in M71 glomerular size was a result of increased number of M71-specific sensory neurons within the olfactory epithelium.</s><s>We next determined that 3 consecutive days of olfactory dependent fear training replicated the glomerular plasticity observed over 3 weeks of training, which also suggests that the increase in glomerular area is long-lasting, remaining for at least 3 weeks following the 3 d training regimen.</s><s>Therefore, we hypothesized that 3 consecutive days of CPP training would also lead to changes in glomerular size 3 weeks later.</s><s>In the final experiment, we demonstrated that long-lasting glomerular plasticity in adult mice can occur with both appetitive and aversive associative olfactory learning.</s></p><p><s>These data suggest that the olfactory system is dynamically regulated, even at the level of the primary sensory pathway, in an activity-dependent manner in adult mice.</s><s>These odor-specific adaptations occur with associative learning in a way that does not depend on odor exposure alone, nonspecific odor learning, shock-stress, or handling procedures.</s><s>The final experiment with cocaine-mediated CPP demonstrates that the valence of the emotional learning is unlikely the crucial factor in glomerular plasticity, but instead it is potentially the emotional salience.</s><s>Finally, the data suggest that the learning-dependent changes we find in the olfactory bulb are accompanied by an increased number of odorant-specific neurons in the olfactory epithelium.</s><s>Although glomerular enlargement with olfactory stimulation has been observed in developing young rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Coopersmith and Leon, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Woo et al., 1987)</ref> or in insect models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Faber et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sachse et al., 2007)</ref>, this study is novel in the demonstration of glomerular plasticity not just following olfactory stimulation, but after olfactory-dependent associative learning, in the adult mammalian olfactory system.</s></p><p><s>Since OSNs periodically die off and are replaced, the cell number increase in the olfactory epithelium could indicate a learningdependent increase in neurogenesis of the M71 neurons.</s><s>However, given that odorant receptor specificity is thought to be determined postmitotically by an irreversible stochastic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Li et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shykind et al., 2004)</ref>, such a selective neurogenesis would require the CNS to influence OR gene expression in immature neurons by a yet undiscovered mechanism.</s><s>Alternatively, longer survival time may exist for the M71 neurons, perhaps through learning-dependent release of neurotrophins from the olfactory bulb.</s><s>This hypothesis seems more likely since mature OSNs have neurotrophin receptor-expressing axon projections to the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Roskams et al., 1996)</ref> and the connection to OB is known to be required for OSN survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schwob et al., 1992)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results may explain enhanced odorant sensitivity and increased intranasal olfactory-evoked responses to repetitive odorant exposure as has been demonstrated in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wang et al., 1993)</ref>, rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Youngentob and Kent, 1995)</ref> and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wang et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>These increased odor responses were seen after 23-90 d, approximately equal or longer than our own protocol.</s><s>Of course, more rapid changes in odor perception might be associated with higher olfactory areas and may not require this mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Li et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The data may also explain multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome, in which a person becomes extremely hypersensitive to certain odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bell et al., 1992)</ref>.</s><s>This idiopathic disorder is thought to occur with aversive olfactory experience and subsequent odor sensitization.</s><s>Our data suggest a hypothesis that in such patients, aversive olfactory experiences may lead to enhanced structural representation and sensitivity of specific olfactory receptor pathways at the primary sensory level.</s><s>Finally this phenomenon, occurring at the primary olfactory synapse, will provide a very powerful model of adult learning-dependent plasticity, in which differential cues within the same modality can differentially modify structural representation.</s><s>This approach also provides a powerful tool for examination of top-down regulation of sensory systems.</s><s>For example, our group has shown that acquisition, but not expression, of olfactory-mediated fearconditioning is blocked by local infusion of NMDA antagonists into the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Walker et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, we can now test whether the primary sensory changes we have seen in the current experiments are also amygdala-dependent.</s><s>If so, this would provide a striking example of how the amygdala can modulate learning-dependent plasticity in different brain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McGaugh, 2004)</ref>, in this case, perhaps via direct centrifugal projections to the olfactory bulb and/or via amygdala-dependent modulation of monoamine cell groups that project to the bulb.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
