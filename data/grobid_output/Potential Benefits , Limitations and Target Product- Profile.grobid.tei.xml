<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The interactions between mosquitoes and humans are central to the transmission of human malaria and other mosquito borne pathogens.</s><s>Blood-seeking mosquito vectors identify humans from more than 30 meters away by detecting and following the chemical cues that the humans emit <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>In recent years, studies of the olfactory mechanisms of the Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit malaria in Africa, have yielded considerable insights into the molecular and physiological processes involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In some studies, the aim has been to discern how these processes influence malaria transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, while in others it has been to find synthetic compounds that attract or repel mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>From a public health point of view, the primary motive for investigating these issues lies in the potential to create new mosquito surveillance and abatement technologies.</s></p><p><s>While their applications in public health are still limited, odorbaited technologies are widely exploited in the agricultural sector where pest control is generally more advanced than is the case for vectors of human diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Notable examples of success include the push-pull strategies practiced in crop pest management <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and the control of tsetse flies, which transmit human and animal trypanosomiasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In both cases, the behavior of the pest is manipulated such that, instead of finding their intended hosts, they are lured into traps or onto insecticide-treated targets.</s><s>Several types of odor-baited mosquito traps have been developed but they are used primarily for sampling, rather than controlling vector populations.</s><s>Common examples include traps baited with whole humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and those baited with carbon dioxide or other synthetic host cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Perhaps the most convincing examples of what may be possible by introducing lethal traps or targets is provided by the most successful existing methods of malaria control today: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and the application of indoor-residual sprays (IRS) to houses <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>Both methods essentially turn existing blood resources (people) and associated resting site resources (human dwellings) into lethal mosquito traps.</s></p><p><s>One important factor to consider before introducing new vector control methods, such as odor-baited mosquito traps, in Africa is the ongoing scale up of long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) across the continent <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>These nets have lowered malaria burden in many endemic countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> and are currently prioritized as the frontline malaria prevention method across most of Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, past and recent trends indicate that many countries are steadily increasing coverage with ITNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>With these developments, it is necessary that any new tools are not evaluated in isolation, but rather on the basis of how much additional benefit they confer upon these communities where nets are already being used.</s><s>The successful rollout of ITNs also poses new challenges by selectively suppressing transmission by indoor biting mosquitoes that prefer human blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>New complementary vector control strategies that target the more zoophagic, exophagic vector species are required to tackle the residual transmission mediated by such modified vector populations.</s></p><p><s>While some relatively expensive designs have been proposed as being suitable for trapping mosquitoes in numbers sufficient to achieve population control <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, no rigorous large scale and independent evaluations of these technologies have been reported.</s><s>More importantly, even though there is a constantly growing interest in odor-baited technologies, essential characteristics which they should posses so as to effectively control or disrupt malaria transmission have not been determined.</s><s>Also unknown are the optimal approaches that could be used to deliver them as public health commodities.</s><s>Nevertheless, recent field trials of novel synthetic odor blends have shown that they can exceed the attractiveness of humans by up to four fold <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and affordable, practical outdoor trap designs are becoming available <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>, so the possibility of controlling malaria vector populations and malaria transmission is becoming increasingly realistic.</s></p><p><s>Here, the potential for using odor-baited mosquito traps to control malaria in a number of common epidemiological scenarios in Africa is mathematically investigated.</s><s>Firstly, we examined whether traps, when used alone or as a complementary intervention alongside insecticidal nets, can fully reduce malaria transmission in highly endemic areas.</s><s>Secondly, the target product-profiles that developers of this technology should consider so as to ensure effectiveness under real-life operational conditions were elucidated.</s><s>These were accomplished by modifying an existing mathematical model of malaria transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, which has previously been useful for informing global ITN coverage policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, but for which substantive revision was prompted by this particular example of odor-baited mosquito traps.</s><s>The traps were treated as pseudo-hosts, which unlike humans or cattle, cannot provide blood to host-seeking mosquitoes, but which mosquitoes can attack nonetheless.</s><s>This conceptual reformulation enabled explanation of the potential value and target product profiles of mosquito traps as a means to complement ITNs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the model</head><p><s>This is an adaptation of a deterministic model representing the most important host-seeking, survival and malaria transmission processes that individual mosquitoes undertake before they can transmit malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>All parameter symbols and their meanings are outlined in tables 1 and 2. Versions of the original model have been used to explore effects of bednets, cattle, repellents and insecticides on malaria transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, to outline global coverage targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and likely efficacy of ITNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, and also to examine interactions within push-pull strategies such as combining net-use with zooprophylaxis using cattle <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Blood feeding is the most important epidemiological event in the interactions between humans and malaria vector mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</s><s>In this model, the blood acquisition process is considered as having three phases: 1) the mosquito being in a host-seeking state, 2) the mosquito attacking the host (or diverting away) and 3) the mosquito feeding upon the host (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>As in previous works by other authors, this feeding process is considered to be cyclical rather than continuous, so as to more accurately represent natural events <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s>The model examines diversion and mortality processes that occur during the three phases and how changes induced by interventions upon these processes can contribute to individual and community-level protection against malaria.</s></p><p><s>Effects of odor-baited traps were simulated in conceptual environments of two alternative dominant vector species (Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto Giles or An.</s><s>arabiensis Patton) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> in the presence of cattle, the main alternative blood source for these vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and presence or absence of ITNs.</s><s>In each test scenario, the technology was evaluated in terms of combined, individual and community-level protection against malaria transmission when traps are implemented alone or in combination with ITNs.</s></p><p><s>Similar to most malaria transmission models, an enclosed ecosystem of parasites, vectors and hosts, is assumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>.</s><s>In order to further reduce computational complexity, the human hosts are considered to be homogenously mixed, meaning that vulnerability of individuals to malaria infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref> or attractiveness of individuals to mosquitoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref>] can be reasonably estimated using population mean values for these parameters.</s><s>These assumptions allowed for exploration of what might be possible if the traps are concentrated in geographical areas where mosquito densities are most abundant.</s><s>Such locations are known to exist in real field settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> and can be targeted to achieve greatly enhanced control of pathogen transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the original model, the term 'hosts' referred to any vertebrate blood-sources upon which vectors can feed.</s><s>This definition is hereby expanded to include all entities that a vector can attack with the intention of taking a blood meal, regardless of whether that entity actually has blood or not.</s><s>This redefinition allows for inclusion of odor-baited traps as additional hosts (more precisely, pseudo-hosts) even though mosquitoes cannot possibly obtain blood from them.</s><s>Another modification was a more explicit subdivision of the host-seeking process.</s><s>Unlike the original model, the host-seeking process is considered here as consisting of two successive stages leading to the mosquito attacking the host namely: 1) non-host oriented kinesis, referring to arbitrary movements of the mosquito before it detects host cues, a process which ends with a host encounter event, and 2) host-oriented taxis, referring to directional movements of the mosquito once it encounters and detects the host cues in the environment and starts moving towards the source of those cues, a process which if initiated, either ends with a host attack event, or is aborted resulting in diversion back to kinesis (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The duration of non-host-oriented kinesis, which is equivalent to the reciprocal of the rate at which an individual host is encountered by an individual vector, depends on: 1) physical distance between hosts and mosquitoes and 2) the distance over which attractive host odor plumes can extend.</s><s>This means mosquitoes are more likely to encounter hosts which are near to the point at which they began host-seeking than those hosts which are far away.</s><s>In nature, such spatial relations, including modifiers such as topography and wind direction are known to be important determinants of rates at which individual hosts are encountered <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</s><s>This definition of the kinesis process also means that mosquitoes will more readily encounter hosts whose odor plumes extend over a wide radius than hosts which have short-radius plumes.</s><s>For the purposes of this model, wider odor plumes are regarded as being equivalent to more mosquitoes potentially falling within the range of host encounter.</s><s>Therefore hosts generating such kairomonal plumes are considerably more readily available than hosts generating less dispersed, short radius plumes.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, recent field trials of odor-baited traps demonstrate that the host-specific cues which malaria vector mosquitoes use to identify their preferred human hosts act mainly as long range attractants, presumably triggering the encounter process itself and allowing mosquitoes to make the choice between attack and diversion as early and as efficiently as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Host-oriented taxis begins immediately after host encounter once the mosquito as chosen to proceed with host attack.</s><s>There is a possibility that a mosquito encountering a non-preferred host type will ignore the opportunity to approach the host or may discontinue taxis, thus diverting back to non-host-oriented kinesis to seek other hosts.</s><s>Once the mosquito commits to attack a host, it is assumed to complete a full taxis phase which ends with the host attack event.</s></p><p><s>The original definition of host availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> was also altered to specifically and separately describe the availability of hosts for attack rather than availability of host blood per se.</s><s>The availability (a) of any host of any species or type (s) for mosquitoes to attack is the product of the rate at which individual vectors encounter that host (e s ) and the probability that, after this encounter, they will Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>Symbols and their meanings.</s></p></div>

transmission situations where unprotected persons are exposed to 200 infections bites per person annually, 80% ITN coverage combined with about 45 traps per 1000 people could reduce relative exposure

use.</s><s>In addition to the need for cheaper CO 2 generation, it also follows traps should be small and practical enough to be delivered and maintained in isolated African villages at reasonable costs.</s></p><p><s>Unlike ITNs which can be marketed as household consumer products, traps provide only communal benefits and would require a customized delivery mechanism to maximize its usefulness.</s><s>We expect that even if the target product profiles that we have outlined here were manageable cost-wise, vertical and presumably community-based delivery mechanisms would be necessary to supply and deploy the traps.</s><s>We propose that where local governance and administrative systems are already strengthened, or where they can be supported by centralized national malaria control programmes, sustainable implementation of a traps-based strategy may possibly be achieved through participatory approaches similar to those applied for scaling up community-based sanitation technologies like Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrines or water source protection among rural communities in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We are not aware of any large scale malaria vector control operations which have used traps of any nature and with which we could directly compare our simulation results.</s><s>Perhaps the most similar example is the 1980s tsetse fly control program in Zambezi valley, in Zimbabwe, where up to 3000 odor-baited tsetse fly targets treated with insecticides were deployed in an area of 600 square kilometres <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Considering the trap requirements predicted by our model, and comparing the simulated scenarios to this particular Zambezi valley tsetse fly program <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, it can be argued that traps might indeed be a viable option for further industrial development to combat malaria.</s></p><p><s>An obvious aspect of the outlined target product profile is that some of the essential trap characteristics can be traded off against each other.</s><s>This is encouraging because such trade-offs may be undertaken to minimize costs of manufacture, installation or maintenance of the traps.</s><s>For example, instead of super-attractive lures that may be too expensive to obtain, one may opt for moderately attractive lures but use larger numbers of more affordable traps and/or ensure that the trap positioning is enhanced.</s></p><p><s>None of these simulations would have been possible without reconsidering the fundamental biological definition of what an available host is and distinguishing this from the availability of blood.</s><s>While host availability has been defined as either of these two possibilities (attackable hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> versus blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> in previous models), this is the first time that this crucial distinction has been explicitly considered and separately parameterized.</s><s>The combination of ITNs with odor-baited traps proved an ideal example because, while the former has a non-zero value for both parameters, traps provide no blood and cannot be plausibly represented with models which do not distinguish between these two quantities.</s><s>Beyond this specific application, this fundamental re-evaluation of how resource acquisition processes can be conceptualized may be particularly useful for modeling intervention options as diverse as mosquito repellents <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">111]</ref>, house screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> and the auto-dissemination of larvcides <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> and slow acting adulticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recent advances in mathematical modelling of how agricultural pests interact with pheromones suggest that such kinetic approaches could greatly improve evaluation of various interventions that use synthetic odor-cues, including not only host-derived attractants, but also pheromones usually used to disrupt insect mating in agricultural fields.</s><s>For example in a recent publication by Miller et al, in which simple algebraic equations for attraction and competitive attraction were validated, cumulative moth catches were expressed as a function of findability of trap baited with pheromone lures, efficiency of the traps, the retention time of the moths in the traps and the densities in an environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>.</s><s>If compared to the host-seeking processes of female mosquitoes as presented in this paper, findability of traps as presenter by Miller et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> may be considered analogous to trap encounter rates (Eq. 1 of this paper), while, trap efficiencies would be set to 1.0, with an infinite retention time of all mosquitoes that attack the traps, assuming that trapped mosquitoes do not escape afterwards.</s><s>Nevertheless, it may be stated also that the current analyses deals more with competitive attraction, as opposed to non-competitive attraction, and that odor-baited mosquito traps must therefore have relative availabilities greater than 1.0, so as to be effective.</s></p><p><s>Though we consider these simulations to have been generally successful, we also recognize that there were some limitations with this particular model.</s><s>For example, it is assumed that at the point when the vector attacks the host, there are only two possibilities: that either the vector feeds successfully and consequently survives or it dies in the attempt before obtaining a blood meal (Eq.</s><s>4).</s><s>This argument implies that no mortality occurs after blood meal acquisition, and instead considers all attack related mortality as occurring prior to feeding.</s><s>This is not entirely true since there can be additional mortality immediately after feeding or midway through feeding, by which time malaria transmission may have occurred if the host was a susceptible human.</s><s>As such, the model may slightly underestimate effects of ITNs on mosquito mortality.</s><s>We therefore advise that our results be interpreted in view of protection from human exposure to infection as the model may not capture the full impact of ITNs on onward transmission, mediated by mosquitoes picking up parasites from a protected person and successfully transmitting the parasites to another person.</s><s>Also, as has been the case with essentially all the deterministic malaria transmission models, with a few notable exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">116]</ref>, our formulation does not consider fine scale spatial relations and heterogeneities in the dynamics of mosquito and human populations.</s></p><p><s>Lastly, it should be noted that in order for our findings to be generalizable to different transmission scenarios across Africa, this model formulation and also its previous versions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> use relative EIR on a log scale of 0 to 1 instead of empirical field estimates, to represent various outcomes of the modelled interventions.</s><s>We recognize however, that for each individual scenario, it would be more reasonable to use absolute empirical indicators, such as mosquito trap catches, or malaria parasite prevalence rates.</s><s>As such our simulations and findings do not exclude the essential need for field evaluation, by way of community scale trials, to ascertain the actual benefits of combining ITNs with odor-baited mosquito traps.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, these simulations do allow for much clearer quantitative insights into the future potential of odor-baited mosquito traps strategies for malaria transmission control.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Odor-baited mosquito traps could provide substantial protection against malaria in their own right and could augment benefits already achieved with ITNs if deployed as a complementary intervention.</s><s>For this strategy to succeed, we propose that the following three key criteria should be met: 1) that the odor-baits should be considerably more attractive to malaria vectors than humans, 2) that the traps should be located in areas where hostseeking mosquitoes are concentrated and 3) that they need to be cheap and easy to deploy at a rate of 20-130 traps per 1000 people.</s><s>Finally, if efficacious interventions matching this target product profile were developed, we recommend that the most appropriate way to deploy them effectively and sustainably would be through vertical rather than horizontal delivery mechanisms, which will require strong technical support from central authorities such as National Malaria Control Programmes, as well as broad progress towards improved governance and capacity of local authorities to implement such programmes on the ground.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>y h,u,VCommunal protection provided by the integrated intervention package V to people who do not use ITNs.</s><s>This paper.</s><s>y V Mean relative exposure of an average member of a community where the intervention package V is implemented.</s><s>This paper.</s><s>z Availability of blood from an individual host: rate at which a single mosquito encounters, attacks and successfully feeds upon a given single host This paper.</s><s>Z Total availability of blood from hosts and pseudo hosts: rate at which a single mosquito encounters, attacks and successfully feeds upon all hosts.</s><s>This paper.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0011573.t002</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
