spatial frequency, 1.0 or 1.5 cycles/°w ith randomized spatial phase; temporal frequency, 2 Hz sinusoidal contrast modulation).</s><s>The orientation/contrast discrimination experiment (experiment 1) used grayscale luminance-defined sinusoidal gratings, the edges of which were attenuated by linearly decreasing the grating contrast over the distance from 3.0°to 3.5°radius (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Full contrast gratings were used in the orientation discrimination task, and a base contrast of 80% was used in the contrast discrimination task.</s><s>For this experiment, the gratings successively presented at each location differed in spatial frequency (1.0 and 1.5 cycles/°).</s><s>In the orientation/color discrimination experiment (experiment 2), we used red-and green-tinted square-wave gratings defined in Judd's CIE color space <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Judd, 1951)</ref>, for which chromaticity values are luminance independent (spatial frequency, 1.0 cycles/°with randomized spatial phase; temporal frequency, 2 Hz square-wave contrast modulation; edges, abrupt at 3.5°radius).</s><s>The square-wave pattern was defined by modulations in the luminance dimension (contrast, 67%), and a uniform amount of red or green was added to the entire circular grating (mean chromaticity values for red grating: x, 0.57; y, 0.37; green grating: x, 0.37; y, 0.56).</s><s>A minimum motion technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anstis and Cavanagh, 1983)</ref> was applied to produce luminance-equated tints of red and green for each individual observer.</s></p><p><s>We used a compound white/black cue that straddled the fixation point (Ϯ0.5°) to indicate with 100% validity which of the lateralized gratings should be attended for the visual discrimination task.</s><s>The design of this compound central cue ensured balanced visual stimulation in the two hemifields.</s><s>Subjects were instructed to attend to the grating on the same side of fixation as either the white or black portion of the compound cue; the relevant cue color was reversed every run in experiment 1 and across subjects in experiment 2. The cued location alternated between the left and right grating locations between every stimulus block.</s></p><p><s>Each trial consisted of a brief presentation of the central cue (250 ms on, 250 ms off), followed by a pair of gratings on either side of fixation (1000 ms), a 500 ms interstimulus interval, and a second set of gratings (1000 ms).</s><s>After the second pair of gratings was removed, subjects had 1000 ms in which to make a two-interval forced-choice judgment about the gratings shown at the attended location (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>For the orientation discrimination task, subjects had to report whether the second grating was rotated clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the first grating, by pressing a corresponding key on an MRI-compatible button box.</s><s>In the contrast discrimination task, subjects had to report whether the second grating was of higher or lower contrast than the first grating.</s><s>In the color discrimination task, subjects had to indicate whether the second grating appeared more reddish or greenish relative to the first grating.</s><s>Note that, in the orientation experiment, subjects had to discriminate small changes in orientation of just a few degrees around two possible base orientations (55°or 145°), whereas fMRI decoding was used to predict which of the two base orientations was seen.</s><s>Similarly, in the color experiment, subjects discriminated slight changes in hue between two successive gratings (more or less red or green), whereas the classifier simply predicted .</s><s>Subjects fixated a central bull's eye target while gratings of independent orientation (ϳ55°o r ϳ145°) appeared in each hemifield.</s><s>A compound white/black cue indicated whether subjects should attend to the left or right stimuli; in this example, the black circle indicates "attend right."</s><s>Subjects had to discriminate near-threshold changes in orientation (experiments 1 and 2), contrast (experiment 1), or color (experiment 2) between successive pairs of gratings presented at the cued location.</s><s>Red circles depict the attended location and were not present in the actual display.</s></p><p><s>whether the overall hue was primarily red or primarily green.</s><s>Thus, the subjects' behavioral responses regarding these fine discriminations were not predictive of the coarse stimulus changes.</s></p><p><s>These very small changes in orientation, contrast, or color for the two-interval forced-choice tasks were determined by an adaptive staircase procedure to maintain near-threshold performance at ϳ80% accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Watson and Pelli, 1983)</ref>.</s><s>For experiment 2, changes in color were computed in the L*a*b* color space of the 1986 Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) for a common L*a*b* value, so that the chromaticity of the entire grating could be varied slightly across successive presentations, independently of the luminance-defined orientation pattern.</s><s>It should be noted that human observers are somewhat more perceptually sensitive to chromatic variations for stimuli presented at higher luminance levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kaiser and Boynton, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>As a consequence, the higher luminance regions in the gratings might have been more informative for the observer's color discrimination task.</s><s>Nonetheless, this stimulus design was the preferred option for separating the color and orientation components of the stimulus.</s><s>Had we instead manipulated the changes in color separately for the high and low luminance regions of the grating, this would have introduced a physical color component in the orientation signal because of how the CIE L*a*b* color space is constructed.</s><s>Orientation, contrast, and color variations of equal magnitude were applied at both attended and unattended stimulus locations; however, the interval of change (i.e., first or second grating) and direction of change (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise) was randomly determined at each location to ensure independence.</s><s>In the contrast discrimination experiment, a small amount of orientation jitter was added to match the average orientation change (for each subject) in the orientation task.</s><s>In the orientation/color discrimination experiment, a small amount of orientation jitter (in the color discrimination task) or color jitter (in the orientation discrimination task) was introduced to match the average orientation or color change in the other task.</s></p><p><s>Participants completed 15-22 orientation runs and 16 -22 contrast runs (experiment 1).</s><s>In experiment 2, subjects performed 12 color discrimination runs and 12 orientation discrimination runs, with the task order counterbalanced across subjects.</s><s>Before the actual experiment, subjects practiced the task to estimate the stimulus difference required to maintain ϳ80% accuracy.</s><s>In five runs (of 382 total), perceptual threshold estimates increased steadily over the course of the run, suggesting that subjects had misinterpreted the central cue and performed the task at the opposite spatial location.</s><s>This was subsequently confirmed by subject self-reports, and these runs were therefore excluded from additional analysis.</s></p><p><s>Each scanning session also included two visual localizer runs, in which subjects viewed flickering checkerboard stimuli presented in the same spatial window as the lateral gratings (checker size, 0.4°; display rate, 10 images/s; edge, 0.5°linear contrast ramp).</s><s>The checkerboard stimulus was alternately presented in the left and right hemifield for 12 s blocks, with fixation blank periods occurring at the beginning, between blocks, and at the end of each 300 s run.</s></p><p><s>Data acquisition.</s><s>MRI data were collected on a Philips 3.0 Tesla Intera Achieva MRI scanner at the Vanderbilt University Institute for Imaging Science, using an eight-channel head coil.</s><s>A high-resolution 3D anatomical T1-weighted scan was acquired from each participant (FOV, 256 ϫ 256; 1 ϫ 1 ϫ 1 mm resolution).</s><s>To measure BOLD contrast, standard gradient-echo echoplanar T2*-weighted imaging was used to collect 28 slices perpendicular to the calcarine sulcus, covering the entire occipital lobe as well as the posterior parietal and posterior temporal cortex <ref type="bibr">(TR, 2000 ms;</ref><ref type="bibr">TE, 35 ms;</ref><ref type="bibr">flip angle, 80°;</ref><ref type="bibr">FOV, 192 ϫ 192;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> slice thickness, 3 mm with no gap;

Brain Voyager QX (version 1.8; Brain Innovation) was used for subsequent preprocessing, including slice timing correction and linear trend removal.</s><s>No spatial or temporal smoothing was performed.</s><s>The functional volumes were aligned first to the within-session anatomical scan and then to the previously collected retinotopic mapping data, by rigid-body transformations.</s><s>All automated alignments were inspected and manually refined when necessary.</s><s>After across-session alignment, fMRI data underwent Talairach transformation and reinterpolation using 3 ϫ 3 ϫ 3 mm voxels.</s></p><p><s>Regions of interest.</s><s>Retinotopic mapping of visual areas was performed in a separate scan session using well-established methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sereno et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">DeYoe et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Engel et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Voxels used for decoding analysis were identified within each hemisphere for retinotopic areas V1, V2, V3, V3A, and V4.</s><s>First, voxels near the gray-white matter boundary were identified within each visual area based on retinotopic maps delineated on a flattened cortical surface representation.</s><s>Next, we identified the visually active voxels corresponding to the left and right grating locations, based on statistical activation maps obtained from the visual localizer runs.</s><s>Decoding analyses were performed on three types of region of interest (ROI): contralateral ROIs, ipsilateral ROIs, and a foveal ROI.</s><s>As an example, when decoding the orientation of an attended grating in the left visual field, contralateral ROIs would consist of voxels in the right hemisphere that receive direct input from the attended left grating location, ipsilateral ROIs would consist of voxels in the left hemisphere that receive direct input from the ignored right grating location, and the foveal ROI consisted of voxels in the foveal confluence of each hemisphere that responded to neither grating location.</s></p><p><s>In experiment 1, we selected 120 voxels from each of V1, V2, and V3, separately for each hemisphere, which were most significantly activated by the contralateral localizer stimulus (the selection of 120 voxels corresponds to an approximate activation threshold of p Ͻ 0.05).</s><s>Because the V3A and V4 ROIs were substantially smaller than the earlier visual areas, for these analyses the two areas were combined into a single ROI, from which the 120 most significantly active voxels in each hemisphere were chosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kamitani and Tong, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Classification accuracy was not strongly affected by further increasing the number of voxels selected, with similar accuracy levels found for up to 200 voxels from each visual area (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s></p><p><s>We tested for spatial spreading of feature-selective activity beyond the cortical regions receiving direct input, by applying the same decoding analyses to ipsilateral ROIs and the foveal ROI.</s><s>For the ipsilateral region of interest, we selected voxels ipsilateral to the stimulus location that were significantly activated by the localizer stimulus when presented in the mirror symmetric location in the contralateral visual field.</s><s>For this region of interest, we excluded voxels that lay within 6 mm of the cortical midline as a conservative measure to avoid any possible inclusion of voxels encompassing portions of the contralateral hemisphere.</s><s>The 120 voxels most significantly activated by the functional localizer were then chosen from within these restricted ROIs.</s><s>Of the 480 voxels per hemisphere selected for the main analysis, only 17 voxels on average were excluded from the ipsilateral analysis because of proximity to the midline.</s><s>For the foveal region of interest, we used voxels from the foveal confluence in areas V1-V3 combined.</s><s>As a conservative measure, we only selected voxels in this ROI that were not significantly activated by the localizer stimulus, obtaining on average 30 voxels per hemisphere.</s></p><p><s>The color and orientation discrimination experiment (experiment 2) used similar procedures for ROI definition.</s><s>However, far fewer training samples were available for training the classifier (12 runs of data per task condition compared with ϳ20 on average for experiment 1), such that classification performance in individual areas was less reliable than in the previous experiments.</s><s>Accordingly, for this experiment, 250 voxels were selected in each hemisphere from a combined V1-V4 ROI.</s><s>To avoid biasing the voxel selection toward the earlier visual areas, which tended to show more significant responses to the localizer stimulus, these 250 voxels were chosen at random from all those in the combined ROI.</s><s>This randomized selection procedure was repeated 10 times for each hemisphere.</s><s>Classification accuracy remained stable with increasing numbers of voxels, up to 500 voxels (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>, available at www. jneurosci.org</s><s>as supplemental material).</s></p><p><s>BOLD amplitude analyses.</s><s>Voxels selected for BOLD amplitude analyses were the same as those used for decoding.</s><s>All data were transformed from MRI signal intensity to units of percentage signal change, calculated relative to the average level of activity for each voxel across the fixation rest periods at the beginning and end of each run.</s><s>Mean responses per block (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 B</ref>) were calculated by averaging the BOLD response within the relevant time window, after incorporating a 4 s delay to account for hemodynamic lag.</s></p><p><s>fMRI data samples used for decoding.</s><s>All fMRI data were transformed from MRI signal intensity to units of percentage signal change, calculated for each voxel in attended (unattended) blocks relative to its average amplitude across all attended (unattended) blocks within a given run.</s><s>The fMRI time series were shifted by 4 s to account for hemodynamic delay.</s><s>All data belonging to the same block were then temporally averaged, arriving at a spatial pattern of time-averaged activity for each block, consisting of the amplitude of every preselected voxel within the region of interest.</s><s>All samples were labeled according to the stimulus orientation or color and analyzed separately for attended and unattended conditions.</s></p><p><s>Linear classifier.</s><s>We used multivariate pattern classification methods to decode the viewed orientation or color from fMRI activity patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kamitani and Tong, 2005)</ref>, enabling us to determine whether the strength of feature-selective fMRI responses is affected by spatial attention or behavioral task.</s><s>Decoding performance gives an indication of the amount of orientation or color information available on the scale of fMRI voxels, such that relative changes therein can be informative about the effects of attention.</s><s>This approach is illustrated here using orientation as an example, but we applied the same procedures to estimate the amount of color information carried by the fMRI activity patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sumner et al., 2008;</ref><ref

preference for particular orientations, presumably because of random millimeters-scale variations in the spatial distribution of orientation-selective cortical columns <ref type="bibr"

orientation to be decoded from coarse-scale population responses.</s><s>An increase in the strength of orientation-selective fMRI responses is reflected by improved decoding performance.</s></p><p><s>Data samples were analyzed using a linear classifier to predict the viewed orientation (or color).</s><s>We used linear support vector machines to obtain a linear

2007)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with these observations, we found information about attended orientations and attended colors not only in cortical regions corresponding to the attended stimulus but also in the opposite hemifield containing the unattended stimulus and in the foveal representation as well.</s><s>Such task-related activity was found even when the attended stimulus differed in orientation from the unattended stimulus, indicating that this top-down orientation-selective signal can operate independently of the bottom-up input.</s></p><p><s>This study also revealed a dissociation between the strength of the BOLD response and the amount of information found in the pattern of BOLD activity.</s><s>Spatial attention led to stronger BOLD responses in all three experiments, yet this was not automatically accompanied by improved strength of orientation-or colorselective activity.</s><s>Thus, greater activity in the visual cortex does not necessarily indicate stronger feature-selective responses.</s><s>Moreover, reliable information might sometimes be found in brain regions that show weak BOLD activity.</s><s>A recent study demonstrated that information about an orientation maintained in working memory could be decoded during the blank delay period, even when overall activity in the visual cortex fell to baseline levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Harrison and Tong, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The relationship between BOLD amplitude and information contained in the activity pattern appears to be far from straightforward.</s><s>Dissociations between these two measures are important to consider, especially given that most previous fMRI studies have focused exclusively on changes in BOLD amplitude as an index of specific cognitive or neural processes.</s><s>An advantage of the fMRI decoding approach is its emphasis on measuring the amount of information contained in fMRI activity patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kamitani and Tong, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Haynes and Rees, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Norman et al., 2006)</ref>, which could potentially reveal a different interpretation of the brain activity.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, most theories of attention assume that spatial attention leads to enhanced processing of all stimulus features at the attended location, regardless of the task performed.</s><s>However, the present results suggest that, although spatial attention en-hances the overall BOLD response in the human visual cortex, this overall enhancement is not necessarily accompanied by improved encoding of stimulus features.</s><s>Rather, feature-selective responses may be selectively enhanced according to their relevance to the observer's behavioral task.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
