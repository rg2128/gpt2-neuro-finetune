type="bibr" target="#b23">Lundqvist et al., 2016)</ref>, we found that gamma power and spiking were tightly associated.</s><s>But gamma power did not simply index spiking.</s><s>For (behaviorally) preferred vs. non-preferred categories, we found less spiking but more power for the preferred category.</s><s>Thus, the two signals are not the same and they contribute differently to category information in vlPFC.</s><s>Whereas vlPFC was more driven by bottom-up inputs (sample onset), dlPFC was more in sync with its oscillatory/top-down dynamics.</s><s>Beta oscillations were predominant in power and spike-LFP coherence in dlPFC; and carried more information at high abstractness.</s><s>This suggests a two-stage, rhythm-based model for category abstraction in different PFC regions.</s><s>Lower-level categories are first extracted from bottom-up inputs to vlPFC reflected in stimulus-locked gamma power and spiking.</s><s>Then, beta network interactions in dlPFC encode more abstract levels that transcend appearance and depend more on top-down processing.</s></p><p><s>This anatomical distinction between PFC regions by level of abstraction might result from their differential connectivity to posterior cortex.</s><s>vlPFC may be more governed by bottomup processing, because it receives direct inputs from inferior temporal cortex (IT) via the ventral stream ("the what") and may, thus, continue the functional properties of IT neurons into PFC.</s><s>Therefore, category processing in vlPFC can be viewed as an object recognition problem based on bottom-up/stimulus-based principles.</s><s>By contrast, dlPFC has stronger connectivity to parietal cortex via the dorsal stream ("the where/how") and thus may identify more complex relationships to objects that optimize behavior (O <ref type="bibr">'Reilly, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Categorization in dlPFC may therefore extend beyond object recognition to less stimulusbased, more rule-based, top-down and abstract processing.</s><s>This fits with the framework that gamma rhythms support the feedforward flow of cortical information, while beta rhythms support feedback <ref type="bibr"

epoch, whereas for dlPFC-beta it was stronger for high abstractness during the delay.</s><s>This temporal pattern further supports the bottom-up/top-down distinction.</s><s>Low-distortion exemplars can be judged on their physical appearance using bottom-up processing, because they look like their prototypes.</s><s>Thus, the category judgment for low-distortions can be made more quickly during the influx of sensory information.</s><s>Consequently, gamma power showed more information for low distortions during stimulus presentation (sample epoch).</s><s>By contrast, beta power and information was less tied to stimulus onset, it was equally strong for low and high abstractness during the sample epoch and for high abstractness this selectivity was maintained into the delay.</s><s>In this view, the category signal in dlPFC-beta was more robust against abstractness, such that it remained at a constant level in face of increasing amounts of distortion.</s><s>Another interpretation might be that higher distortions require more abstraction (and thus more top-down processing) because the defining characteristics of the category, the unseen prototype, are less obvious.</s><s>They don't "look alike" like the lower distortions and thus rely more on rule-based categorization.</s><s>Thus, information in beta power might remain significant during the delay for high distortions (while it declines for low distortions) because the higher degree of abstraction requires more thought and thus longer top-down processing extending after the bottom-up sensory input has ceased.</s><s>This pattern suggests that category information in dlPFC is not just passively robust against increasing degrees of abstractness.</s><s>Instead, dlPFC-beta oscillations might reflect a specialized top-down mechanism for high abstractness levels.</s></p><p><s>The functional relevance of category abstraction in PFC was supported by the data in three different ways.</s><s>First, there was more category information on correct trials for vlPFCgamma in the sample epoch and for dlPFC-beta in the delay.</s><s>Beyond buttressing its functional importance in the task, this pattern mirrors the effects seen for distortion/ abstraction (i.e., gamma during sample, beta during delay), which, in turn, is in line with the bottom-up vs. top-down distinction.</s><s>Second, the distortion/abstraction effects were not merely due to more generic effects of task difficulty or attention.</s><s>Greater difficulty reduced information for both frequencies, while abstractness had opposite effects on them (more information for low in vlPFC-gamma and for high in dlPFC-beta).</s><s>Third, the category preference observed in behavior was directly reflected in the neural dynamics in PFC.</s><s>Categorization can be based on dividing exemplars in two categories ("A vs. B") or by a strategy with one dominant category, against which all exemplars are judged ("A vs not-A", analogous to a figure-ground distinction).</s><s>Our results suggest the latter.</s><s>Behaviorally, one category was often preferred ("A") and, on this category, performance differed between low and high abstractness levels.</s><s>In the neural effects, category preference was observed in lower spike rates and higher power in the dominant frequency per PFC area (dlPFC-beta, vlPFCgamma) for the preferred category.</s><s>This resulted in positive correlation between power differences and behavioral performance differences between categories.</s><s>The negative correlation for vlPFC-beta power is in line with the antagonistic relationship between beta and gamma in each PFC subdivision.</s><s>In line with recent findings and computational models, stronger gamma power co-occurs with weaker beta power and vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lundqvist et al, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">2016)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the negative correlation with performance of vlPFC-beta

7 DVA.</s><s>In order to control for difficulty, these arbitrarily constructed prototypes had to obey a number of rules: (1) They had no dot centers that fell within 0.7 DVA of one another.</s><s>(2)

categories was controlled over sessions and exemplars from different categories were different enough to ensure above chance performance.</s><s>(4) The exemplars from each category, which could in

classify numerous category exemplars into their respective categories (delayed match-to-category paradigm, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>To initiate each trial, each animal had to fixate within 2.5 (DVA) of a centrally located, red dot (0.2 DVA in diameter) for 0.5 s.</s><s>After this fixation, an exemplar of one of the two categories was presented at the center of the screen (7 by 7 DVA) for 1s.</s><s>If the animal continued to fixate through this sample epoch, and a subsequent delay of at minimum 0.85 s (plus an additional jitter of max.</s><s>0.4s), then the central fixation dot disappeared and two new exemplars from either category (match vs. non-match) were presented on the left and right side of the screen (9 from the center of the screen).</s><s>Once the test exemplars appeared, the animal had the opportunity to freely view both of the exemplars presented, and make the choice.</s><s>The animal indicated its choice by fixating

blocks.</s><s>The blocks were defined by a progressively growing pool of available exemplars.</s><s>In block 1, there were two exemplars per category.</s><s>The pool of available exemplars grew by accretion; "new" exemplars were added to a bank of "familiar" ones, so that the total number of available exemplars for each category was equal to 2 block .</s><s>The terms novel and familiar are not an indication for how familiar any exemplar was to an animal, but simply a reflection of when it became available in the pool of potentially usable exemplars.</s><s>As the blocks progressed, the chances for only seeing novel exemplars increased substantially, and above chance performance on these novel exemplars suggested successful categorization.</s><s>In fact, block transition was not possible without successful categorization, and the overlap of available exemplars between blocks favored a smooth learning process.</s><s>In order to pass from one block to another, each animal had to successfully complete 70% of the previous 10 trials for each potential condition (Category A -on left, Category A -on right, Category B -on left, and Category B -on right).</s><s>This behavioral criterion ensured that the animals were able to categorize stimuli from an increasing pool of different exemplars and supposedly learned the underlying category rule by the end of the training blocks.</s><s>We only used correct trials above training block 5 with a minimum of 64 different exemplars per category for the analysis of neurophysiological data presented here.</s><s>In addition, the behavioral criterion limited idiosyncratic biases of the animals for either choosing a particular location and/or a particular category.</s><s>Because of these behavioral criteria, not all available exemplars were presented in each block (see Bias correction below).</s><s>An additional restraint was imposed on the pool of available exemplars presented in block 1.</s><s>Because both animals struggled to pass block one, in which two exemplars from each category were presented, the two exemplars from each category had to have a summed Euclidean distance of less than 1 DVA apart.</s><s>This constraint reduced the difficulty of the first block, promoted rapid block passage, and ultimately favored category abstraction.</s><s>Following block one, there was no limitation on the presented exemplars.</s></p><p><s>Bias Correction-As stated above, each of the animals attempted suboptimal strategies (i.e.</s><s>exhibited biased behavioral choices) and, if left to their own devices, they would fail to learn to categorize stimuli.</s><s>To avoid these aberrant behaviors, we detected the animals' biases, and scaled the probability that any particular condition was shown to counteract these "easier," inefficient strategies.</s><s>In order to assess bias in any one of the four conditions enumerated above, we compared performance in each of the four conditions to one another, and computed a Mann Whitney U test statistic for each comparison.</s><s>From this test statistic, we obtained the area under the curve, subtracted 0.5 to obtain a bias measure, and remapped this bias measure to a value between [0-1] by dividing it by 0.5.</s><s>We then used this measure to scale the probability that any particular condition would be seen (i.e.</s><s>we forced more choices for the non-preferred condition by showing it more often).</s><s>We only implemented this bias correction algorithm after 20 trials were performed in each block.</s><s>The bias correction
