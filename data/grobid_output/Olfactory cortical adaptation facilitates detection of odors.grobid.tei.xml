<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Male Long-Evans hooded rats (230-450 g), obtained from Harlan Lab Animals, were used as subjects.</s><s>Food and water were available ad lib.</s><s>In addition, a small number of male Swiss-Webster albino mice (28-41 g), obtained from a breeding colony at the University of Oklahoma and housed as described for rats were used for comparative purposes.</s><s>Animal care and use conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines and were in accordance with the University of Oklahoma IACUC.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p><s>The design of this experiment is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>.</s><s>The experimental protocol consisted of determining the cell's responses to the 2-s test odorants twice including two single components (A and B) and binary mixtures (A + B) with at least a 60-s interstimulus interval.</s><s>Then one of the odorants was randomly selected to serve as the background and was presented for 50 s.</s><s>After the background stimulus was on for 40 s, the second stimulus was added (A + B) for 2 s (thus 1 target odorant presented with the other as background).</s><s>If recording stability allowed, the protocol was repeated with the identity of the target and background odorants reversed.</s><s>Further, when neurons responded to other different odorants, they were tested with them in the same way.</s><s>For both binary mixtures and target odorants against background, airflow was equally divided between the two odorants, thus total volume of odorized air during mixtures (intensity) was the same as for a single stimulus, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wilson 2000)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recording and odorant stimulation</head><p><s>Details of single-unit recording and odorant-response characterization techniques for mitral/ tufted and layer II/III aPCX neurons have been reported in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(Wilson 1998a)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, animals were anesthetized with urethan (1.5 g/kg) and were freely breathing with the respiratory cycle monitored through a piezoelectric device.</s><s>The single-unit nature of the recordings was verified by at least a 2-ms refractory period in interval histograms.</s><s>Mitral/tufted cells were identified by antidromic stimulation of the lateral olfactory track (LOT) and layer II/III aPCX neurons were identified by LOT-evoked responses and/or histological confirmation.</s><s>After isolation of a single-unit, 2-s test stimulus presentations were delivered for each odorant to test for responsiveness.</s><s>Only cells that responded to at least two of the odorants were used here.</s><s>Because the odorants selected were molecularly diverse, no attempt was made to direct main olfactory bulb (MOB) recording locations with reported spatial maps of glomerular layer activity, in contrast to our previous work using homologous series of ethyl esters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fletcher and Wilson 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Odorants were delivered with a flow-dilution olfactometer, with a constant, 1 liter per minute (LPM) flow of charcoal-filtered, humidified air presented 1-2 cm from the animal's nose.</s><s>Saturated odorant vapor was added at 0.1 LPM to the clean air stream via computer-controlled solenoids to produce an approximate dilution of 1:10 of saturated vapor.</s><s>Odorant stimulus onset was triggered off the respiratory cycle to coincide with the transition from inhalation to exhalation, and the test stimulus duration was 2 s. Background stimuli were presented for a total of 50 s with the 2-s target stimulus presented 40 s after background onset.</s><s>Stimuli included peppermint (McCormick), isoamyl acetate, eugenol, and pentane (Sigma); and binary mixtures of odorants were within these four odorants.</s><s>To deliver odorants in binary mixtures, airflow was equally divided between the two odorants, thus total volume of odorant mixture was the same as for a single stimulus (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wilson 2003)</ref>.</s><s>This method of creating binary mixtures by splitting the airflow was deliberately chosen to reduce the possibility that neurons responding to an odorant presented against background were simply responding due to a change in airflow.</s><s>This design, however, means that the volume of air saturated with each individual component during binary mixture stimulation, or target odorant against background presentation, is half of that experienced during single component stimulation.</s><s>Odorized airflows entered a 3-cmlong mixing chamber prior to delivery to the animal to enhance uniformity of concentration and mixing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>The response magnitude of both mitral/tufted and aPCX neurons to odorants were quantified as the difference in number of spikes evoked during the 2-s stimulus compared with a 2-s prestimulus period.</s><s>Response magnitude to target odorants were compared with firing rate prior to background odorant onset.</s><s>Repeated-measures ANOVA's with post hoc Fisher tests where appropriate and t-test were performed to compare the responses between mitral/tufted and aPCX neurons, and to investigate whether the neurons had habituated during 40-s exposure to a background odorant.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histology</head><p><s>After recording, animals were overdosed with anesthetic, transcardially perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde, and the brains subsequently sectioned coronally at 40 μ and stained with cresyl violet for determination of electrode positions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Data from a total of 61 mitral/tufted cells from 23 animals and 60 aPCX neurons from 38 animals are included in the analyses.</s><s>Twenty-four mitral/tufted cells and 19 aPCX cells were tested with a single protocol, while 37 mitral/tufted cells and 41 aPCX cells were tested more than once.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixture suppression</head><p><s>RESPONSE TO ODORANTS AGAINST BACKGROUNDS-Mixture suppression is likely to be influenced by a number of subthreshold events not observable with extracellular recordings, and thus response to adaptation and mixtures is more complex and more difficult to interpret.</s><s>Nonetheless, the effects of background stimulation on odor responses in both mitral/tufted neurons and aPCX neurons suggest these cells treat target odors against background differently than mixture addition cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>As in mixture addition cells, mitral/ tufted mixture suppression cells responded to background odor onset, showed no significant adaptation over the course of 40-s background exposure, and significantly responded to the target odor against background [repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3,213) = 5.67, P &lt; 0.01, see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> for pairwise comparisons]).</s><s>In contrast to mixture addition mitral/tufted cells, however, there was no significant difference between responses to the target odor against background and either the binary mixture or target odor alone in mixture suppression mitral/tufted neurons [repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2,142) = 2.25, N.S.].</s></p><p><s>In the aPCX, mixture suppression cells responded to background odor onset, showed significant adaptation to the background and responded to target odors against the background [repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3,240) = 40.37,</s><s>P &lt; 0.01, see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> for pairwise comparisons].</s><s>Again, in contrast to mixture addition aPCX neurons, however, the response to target odorant against background in mixture suppression cells was significantly different from the response to the target odorant alone and different from the response to the binary mixture.</s><s>These results suggest that mixture suppression responses may provide distinctly different information to downstream sites about odorants against background than mixture addition cells and further support the finding that mitral/tufted neurons and aPCX neurons respond to these conditions differently.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The present results suggest that rapid cortical adaptation allows a subset of aPCX neurons to adapt to background odorants and selectively respond to new target odorants introduced against this background.</s><s>Combined with previous work, these results suggest that cortical adaptation has two important functions in olfaction.</s><s>First, it contributes to behavioral odor habituation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Best et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yadon and Wilson 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Second, it allows neurons within the piriform cortex to selectively respond to stimulus change; this may contribute to separation of target odorants from background.</s><s>These results contribute to the growing evidence that the piriform cortex acts as a sensory gate in olfaction, allowing information throughput based on recent experience <ref type="bibr">(Wilson 1998a</ref>) and behavioral state <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Murakami et al. 2005)</ref> and thus shapes behavioral responses to the odor world <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Best et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yadon and Wilson 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It must be emphasized, however, that although the present results are strongly consistent with a role for the aPCX in detection and identification of odorants against background, the present techniques do not allow final determination of whether the target odorant against a background is actually identified, at the single-cell level, as specifically the target odorant alone.</s><s>In fact, it is unlikely that firing rate of single cortical units summed over 2 s is sufficient to allow information about odorant identity to be extracted.</s><s>Individual aPCX neurons most likely contribute to encoding of the quality of multiple odorants through participation in multiple, overlapping cortical ensembles.</s><s>Replication of the current experiments, using ensemble recording techniques, may be required for a complete understanding of cortical coding of odorant quality and odorants against background.</s><s>The correlation analyses present in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, however, do provide some support for similarity in stimulus quality identification.</s></p><p><s>Rapid cortical adaptation allows the aPCX to function similar to a high-pass filter, responding primarily to stimulus change.</s><s>This filtering effect could allow temporal separation of odorants based on differences in onset or inhalation time or potentially based on differences in absorption and transduction time across the olfactory epithelium.</s><s>In fact, work by Laing and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jinks and Laing 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Laing et al. 1994)</ref> has demonstrated that identification of odorants within complex mixtures can be facilitated in humans when the odorants vary in onset or diffusion characteristics.</s><s>The time factor that affected odor identification in those studies (&lt;1 s) was substantially shorter than the time scale here, although it suggests that further investigation at the physiological level is warranted.</s></p><p><s>It should be noted that the present results deal only with situations where background is relatively stable.</s><s>If the background stimulus was fluctuating in intensity or quality, the mechanism described here may not allow filtering.</s><s>However, a background fluctuating in such a way may itself provide important information and thus maintaining responsiveness may be beneficial to the animal in that case.</s><s>In addition, these results are relevant only for short-term adaptation.</s><s>Adaptation after long-term exposure to odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dalton 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dalton and Wysocki 1996)</ref> may involve distinctly different mechanisms and result in unique neurophysiological and perceptual consequences.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cortical reading of olfactory bulb output</head><p><s>In contrast to mixture addition aPCX neurons, olfactory bulb mitral/tufted cells were unable to separate target odorants from background.</s><s>Mixture addition mitral/tufted cell activity during odorant presentation against background was similar to responses to odorant mixtures.</s><s>This difference between mitral/tufted cells and aPCX neurons supports the argument that odorant background separation may be a cortical phenomenon.</s><s>The precise functions of mixture addition and mixture suppression cells at both the olfactory bulb and cortical levels are unclear, although the present results suggest that mixture addition cortical neurons may be particularly important in odorant background segmentation problems.</s><s>Furthermore, the results strongly suggest different roles for mitral/tufted cells and aPCX neurons in odorant coding.</s></p><p><s>Mitral/tufted cell odorant responses are consistent with a feature detection role, wherein the spatiotemporal patterns of mitral/tufted cell activity encode the identity of odorant features <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Araneda et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fletcher and Wilson 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mori et al. 1999)</ref>.</s><s>In situations where more than one perceptual odor object is inhaled (i.e., most situations), the induced patterns of olfactory bulb activity reflect all features present.</s><s>Interactions of odorant features at the olfactory receptor and within local olfactory bulb circuits may occur but most likely do not reflect natural groupings of features (i.e., odor objects).</s><s>Thus olfactory bulb output provides information to higher centers about all features inhaled at any given time.</s></p></div>
