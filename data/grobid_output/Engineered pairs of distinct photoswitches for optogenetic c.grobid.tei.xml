<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Design of two distinct VVD variants.</s><s>VVD is a small photoreceptor that reversibly switches its state from a monomer to a homodimer in response to blue light <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>This dynamic dimerization property of VVD is useful; however, its homodimerization property can also cause serious problems.</s><s>For example, when VVD is used as a photoswitch to bring two different proteins (protein A and protein B) close to each other, the photoreceptor induces not only the A-B interaction but also unwanted A-A and B-B interactions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, this property prevents the efficient induction of the intended A-B interaction and can cause undesirable side effects resulting from the A-A and B-B interactions.</s><s>To overcome this limitation of VVD, we first engineered its homodimer interface, termed Ncap <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The Ncap from Ile47 to Asn56 consists of neutral amino acids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>We developed two distinct types of VVD variants: one with positively charged amino acids in the Ncap and the other with negatively charged amino acids in the Ncap (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Unlike VVD, the two VVD variants recognized each other based on electrostatic interactions (attraction and repulsion).</s><s>The two VVD variants negate the possibility that unwanted A-A and B-B interactions are induced, thereby selectively triggering the induction of the expected A-B interaction with light.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of Magnets.</head><p><s>To monitor the blue light-dependent dimerization of VVD and its variants, we developed a bioluminescence assay system based on the complementation of split-firefly luciferase fragments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref> and Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Using this system, we systematically searched for key amino acid residues in the Ncap of VVD that would lead to the expected electrostatic discrimination once substituted (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>We individually substituted each amino acid residue from 47 to 56 in the Ncap with a negatively charged amino acid and identified variants that showed impaired homodimerization because of electrostatic repulsion (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>We found that the single substitution of Ile52 with aspartic acid substantially decreased the blue lightdependent homodimerization of the VVD variant to similar levels observed in the nonfunctional VVD-C71S variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>We also substituted amino acid residue 52 of VVD with a positively charged amino acid and showed that an arginine substitution effectively suppressed the homodimerization of the VVD variant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>Next, we examined the heterodimerization of the I52R and I52D variants and found that these two variants showed a significant bioluminescence response upon blue light irradiation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>This result indicates that the I52R and I52D substitutions efficiently induced heterodimerization and suppressed homodimerization of the VVD variants.</s></p><p><s>Using mutagenesis of Met55 within both I52R and I52D variants showed that I52R/M55R and I52D/M55G variants were more effective at promoting heterodimerization than other variants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3l</ref>).</s><s>The blue lightdependent heterodimerization of I52R/M55R and I52D/M55G variants was largely improved (light/dark, 21-fold) when compared with the I52R and I52D variants (light/dark, 6.0-fold).</s><s>In addition, I52R/M55R and I52D/M55G variants were more effective at preventing homodimerization when compared with the I52R and I52D variants, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3m,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>As a result of the double substitutions at residues 52 and 55, the pair of I52R/M55R and I52D/M55G variants were selected as the top pair of distinct VVD variants that recognize each other based on electrostatic interactions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>).</s><s>On the basis of their electrostatic interactions, the VVD variants were collectively named 'Magnets'.</s><s>Specifically, the I52R/ M55R variant has a positively charged arginine at residue 52 and was named 'positive Magnet (pMag)', and I52D/M55G has a negatively charged aspartic acid at residue 52 and was named 'negative Magnet (nMag)'.</s></p><p><s>Tuning switch-off kinetics and dimerization efficiencies.</s><s>pMag and nMag quickly form a heterodimer upon blue light irradiation; however, it takes hours for the complex to dissociate after the blue light is shut off (t 1/2 , 1.8 h; rate constant, 1.1 Â 10 À 4 ; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>The slow switch-off kinetics of the pMag-nMag complex is similar to that of the homodimer of VVD (t 1/2 , 2.0 h; rate constant, 9.5 Â 10 À 5 ; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>To tune the switch-off kinetics, we added mutations to Ile74, Ile85, Met135 and Met165 within the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) core of both pMag and nMag because these changes were reported to shorten or lengthen the photocycle of VVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>The substitution of Ile85 with valine in both pMag and nMag caused the complex of the two variants to dissociate with half-life t 1/2 of 4.2 min (rate constant, 2.7 Â 10 À 3 ), which is 25-fold faster than the pMag-nMag complex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>); thus, we renamed the two variants pMagFast1 and nMagFast1.</s><s>Another set of two variants with substitutions of both Ile74 and Ile85 with valine exhibited a substantially accelerated dissociation (t 1/2 , 25 s; rate constant, 2.8 Â 10 À 2 ) that was 250-fold faster than the pMag-nMag complex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>The two variants were named pMagFast2 and nMagFast2.</s><s>Therefore, substitutions that shorten the photocycle reduce the time needed for the dissociation of the pMag and nMag complexes.</s></p><p><s>Despite the successful tuning of the switch-off kinetics of the pMag-nMag complex, we noticed that the bioluminescence signals after the dimerization of pMagFast1 with nMagFast1 and pMagFast2 with nMagFast2 decreased to 47% and 51% of pMag and nMag, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>The result shows that a change in the photocycles of pMag and nMag substantially affected the extent of dimerization and revealed an undesirable functional correlation between fast dissociation kinetics and dimerization efficiency.</s><s>This unwanted trade-off is an unacceptable limitation in the development of useful photoswitches.</s><s>To overcome this problem, we focused on other photocycle-related substitutions.</s><s>M135I and M165I substitutions can lengthen the photocycle of VVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and substantially decelerate the dissociation of the pMag-nMag complex (t 1/2 , 4.7 h; rate constant, 4.1 Â 10 À 5 ; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>We found that these two substitutions dramatically increased the extent of light-dependent dimerization of pMag and nMag up to 1,700% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>The pMag and nMag variants were named pMagHigh1 and nMagHigh1, respectively.</s></p><p><s>We examined the blue light-dependent heterodimerization between pMag variants and nMag variants with different switchoff kinetics.</s><s>The extent of heterodimerization of pMagFast1 and nMagHigh1, which exhibited fast and slow switch-off kinetics, respectively, was enhanced up to 1,400% compared with pMagFast1 and nMagFast1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>The combination of pMagFast2 and nMagHigh1 showed an enhancement of up to 760% compared with pMagFast2 and nMagFast2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>The result indicates that a pairing with nMagHigh1 substantially enhanced the dimerization efficiencies of the pMag variants with fast dissociation kinetics.</s><s>Furthermore, nMagHigh1 does not slow the switch-off kinetics of its heterodimers with the fast pMag variants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>Also, pairing the fast pMag variants with nMagHigh1 did not prevent their reversible dimerization properties (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the heterodimerization of pMag with nMagHigh1 was enhanced up to 1,300% without affecting the switch-off kinetics compared with pMag and nMag (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Our current approach used the combination of two different kinetic variants to solve the unwanted trade-off problem and allowed us to develop photoswitches with both substantially enhanced dimerization efficiencies and accelerated switch-off kinetics.</s></p><p><s>Light-dependent PM-recruitment and dissociation.</s><s>To further study the developed photoswitches, we added a CAAX motif (refs  18-20) to nMagHigh1 and coexpressed it with pMag-mCherry in COS-7 cells.</s><s>Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we observed that pMag-mCherry was recruited to the plasma membrane (PM) where nMagHigh1-CAAX was tethered in a blue light-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>We also tested tandemly repeated pMag fusions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>The apparent concentration of pMag surrounding each nMag molecule and the apparent affinity between the photoswitches were expected to increase using the tandemly repeated fusion of pMag.</s><s>A two tandemly repeated pMag(2x) gave a larger TIRF response than pMag.</s><s>The TIRF response was further increased using a three tandemly repeated pMag(3x), indicating that the PM-recruitment of Magnets is enhanced by using a tandemly repeated fusion.</s><s>Thus, we used pMag(3x) and pMagFast2(3x) for subsequent experiments.</s></p><p><s>We examined the photoswitches consisting of pMagFast2(3x) and nMagHigh1 using confocal microscopy.</s><s>Owing to the low dimerization activity of the photoswitches in the dark state, we observed no significant PM-recruitment of pMagFast2(3x)-iRFP before blue light irradiation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Upon irradiation with blue light, pMagFast2(3x)-iRFP was efficiently recruited to the PM where nMagHigh1-CAAX was tethered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>When the irradiation was removed, pMagFast2(3x)-iRFP returned to the cytosol (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>The PMrecruitment of pMagFast2(3x)-iRFP was reversible and repeatable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed that blue light irradiation of the cells did not recruit pMagFast2(3x)-iRFP to the PM without nMagHigh1-CAAX (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>On the basis of the translocation assay, we analysed the switchon kinetics of the fast photoswitches and showed that the PM-recruitment of pMagFast2(3x)-iRFP was rapidly induced with a t 1/2 on of 1.5 s (rate constant, 4.6 Â 10 À 1 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref> and Supplementary Movie 1).</s><s>We also investigated switch-off kinetics and found that pMagFast2(3x)-iRFP dissociated from the PM with a t 1/2 off of 6.8 s (rate constant, 1.0 Â 10 À 1 ) when the blue light irradiation was removed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>,g and Supplementary Movie 1).</s><s>To our knowledge, the switch-off kinetics of the photoswitches consisting of pMagFast2(3x) and nMagHigh1 are much faster than any other dimerization-based blue photoswitches currently available <ref type="bibr"

photoswitches can control cellular proteins and related cellular functions.</s><s>Phosphoinositides are major signalling molecules at the PM.</s><s>We connected pMag(3x) with an inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain derived from a p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).</s><s>The iSH2 domain was previously paired with chemically inducible dimerizers and other blue and red light photoswitches to control PI3K activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> .</s><s>When expressed in mammalian cells, iSH2-pMag(3x)-iRFP spontaneously binds to an endogenous p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K that generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P 3 ).</s><s>We coexpressed iSH2-pMag(3x)-iRFP with nMagHigh1-CAAX in NIH3T3 cells together with AktPH-mCherry, which is a PI(3,4,5)P 3 biosensor consisting of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> derived from Akt1 and mCherry.</s><s>After blue light irradiation, iSH2-pMag(3x)-iRFP was immediately recruited to the PM where nMagHigh1-CAAX was tethered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>In addition, rapid PM-recruitment of AktPH-mCherry was also observed, indicating that PI(3,4,5)P 3 was immediately produced in the PM upon blue light irradiation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because PI(3,4,5)P 3 is a lipid messenger that regulates membrane morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , we examined the morphological changes in the PM of COS-7 cells that expressed iSH2-pMag(3x)-iRFP and nMagHigh1-CAAX using Lifeact-mCherry <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Blue light irradiation induced lamellipodia and ruffles in the PM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>The morphological change in the PM was accompanied by actin polymerization detected with Lifeact-mCherry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref> and Supplementary Movie 2).</s><s>In addition, we quantitatively analysed cell area before and after irradiation and revealed a significant blue light-dependent expansion of the cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>The observed morphological change in the PM was completely blocked by LY294002, a potent inhibitor of PI3K (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>We also examined cells that did not express both iSH2-pMag(3x)-iRFP and nMagHigh1-CAAX and cells that did not express the latter as controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>).</s><s>The results indicated that the Magnet-based photoactivatable PI3K rapidly generated PI(3,4,5)P 3 upon blue light irradiation; thus, this method induced PI(3,4,5)P 3 -dependent morphological changes in the PM.</s></p><p><s>We conducted spatially and temporally confined optical control of PI3K with pMagFast2(3x).</s><s>COS-7 cells were expressed with iSH2-pMagFast2(3x)-iRFP and nMagHigh1-CAAX with Lifeact-mCherry.</s><s>After focal irradiation of the cells,

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have completed a multi-directional engineering of the fungal photoreceptor VVD and created novel photoswitches named Magnets (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>First, we modified the dimer interface of VVD to prevent unwanted homodimerization and selectively induce heterodimerization.</s><s>As a result, we generated a pair of two distinct VVD variants that recognize each other based on electrostatic interactions.</s><s>Next, additional engineering of the cofactor-binding domain was performed to tune the switch-off kinetics of the heterodimer.</s><s>We generated two contrasting variants, including one with an B250-fold accelerated switchoff kinetics but diminished dimerization efficiencies and one variant with a 17-fold enhanced dimerization efficiency but slower switch-off kinetics.</s><s>We have solved this trade-off problem by pairing the two contrasting variants to create the present photoswitches that showed substantially enhanced dimerization efficiencies and accelerated switch-off kinetics.</s></p><p><s>We showed that pMagFast2-nMagHigh1 exhibited switch-off kinetics with a half-life t 1/2 of 6.8 s in mammalian cells.</s><s>This is substantially faster than any other conventional dimerization-based blue photoswitches reported for optogenetic applications in living cells, including CRY2-CIB1 (t 1/2 , B5.5 min) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , FKF1-GI (t 1/2 , 490 min) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and TULIPs (t 1/2 , 2.8 min) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>In addition to the present fast photoswitches, we also have developed photoswitches with slow switch-off kinetics, such as pMag-nMagHigh1 (t 1/2 , 2.1 h; rate constant, 9.3 Â 10 À 5 ) and pMagHigh1-nMagHigh1 (t 1/2 , 4.7 h).</s><s>While the fast photoswitches provide a powerful tool for spatially and temporally confined optical control of protein activities in the cells, the slow photoswitches require only a oneshot irradiation to act as a continuously active optogenetic tool.</s><s>The slow photoswitches could be used to avoid some unwanted side effects caused by continuous irradiation, such as phototoxicity and unfocused activation owing to sample drift.</s><s>Recently, methods to improve switch-off kinetics of blue light photoreceptors have been developed using bacterial or yeast colonies-based high throughput screening systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>These screening methods can help to further accelerate or decelerate the switch-off kinetics of the present photoswitches.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the tunable property of the switch-off kinetics, which ranged from seconds to hours, Magnets consist of two photosensory units.</s><s>Thus, Magnets are only switched on when both the photosensory units are simultaneously activated, similar to an AND-logic gate.</s><s>In contrast, existing photoswitches consist of photosensory units and binder units 1 that can only be switched on if the photosensory units are activated.</s><s>This is because the binder units are always active.</s><s>The synergistic activation property of Magnets contributes to their extremely low dimerization activity in the dark state.</s><s>The present photoswitches, created by re-engineering the nature of a natural photoreceptor, provide new opportunities for the optogenetic control of a wide variety of cellular proteins and related cellular functions.</s></p></div>
