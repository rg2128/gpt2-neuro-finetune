<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale and implementation of the algorithmic solution</head><p><s>Rationale of the algorithm.</s><s>Based on the graph representation of reconstructed directed interactions, their delays, and the theoretical preliminaries presented in the last subsection, we will now propose an algorithm that detects potentially spurious interactions by exploiting the timing signature of CE and simple CD.</s></p><p><s>As input the algorithm expects a directed, delay-weighted graph G ≔ {V, E}, represented by its connectivity matrix.</s><s>Connections are weighted with the estimated interaction delays</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w ðv a ;v b Þ ¼ dðv a ;v b Þ , i.e.</formula><p><s>, the estimated physical delays between the processes represented by v a and v b .</s><s>Note that such a graph needs to be constructed from a connectivity measure, which is (a) directed and (b) allows for the reconstruction of interaction delays.</s><s>Additionally, the user has to provide a threshold θ to account for noise in empirical measurements as well as imprecision in analysis methods (described in detail below).</s><s>We furthermore assume that weights have been linearly scaled, such that they do not have any decimal places and can be represented by integer values.</s><s>As a first step, we identify potential CEs by assuming that if a CE is present in the data, the bivariate interaction represented by any edge (v a , v b ) 2 E with weight w (v a , vb) can be explained by an alternative routing of information via intermediate vertices (see an example in Fig <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, iteratively for every edge (v a , v b ) in E the algorithm sets v a = v s as the starting and v b = v t as the target node of the current iteration.</s><s>Then the algorithm searches for an alternative path for (v s , v t ), where a path is assumed to be an alternative path if the summed delay interaction times ∑ i w (v i , vi+1) of all edges in the path are (approximatively) equal to w (v s , vt) , i.e., w (v s , vt) -θ &lt; ∑ i w (v i , vi+1) &lt; w (v s , vt) + θ.</s><s>For an example see Fig <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, where edge (v s , v t ) (dashed arrow) has a graphically longer, alternative path hv s , v 1 , v 2 , v t i with equal summed weight (solid arrows).</s><s>If the algorithm finds such an alternative path, the edge currently under investigation is tagged as potentially spurious.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(v i , v j ) edge from v i to v j w (v i , vj) weight of edge (v i , v j ) v i ⇝ v j path from v i to v j v i ⇝ k v j path from v i to v j with</formula><p><s>In a second step, the algorithm additionally identifies potential simple CD effects based on the results from the first analysis step.</s><s>Simple CD effects occur in graph motifs that form acyclic "triangles" (Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>We define an acyclic triangle as any three nodes that are acyclic, pairwise connected.</s><s>We suspect a spurious link due to simple CD if a triangle motif exhibits a suspicious timing signature; these suspicious triangles are identified from the results of the first analysis step by listing all edges with alternative paths of graphical length two.</s><s>We propose to tag two edges in each of these identified triangles: (1) the direct edge due to a CE (edge (v s , v t ) in Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) the second edge due to a simple CD (edge (v 1 , v t ) in Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>Note however, that of both tagged edges one has to be a non-spurious interaction for this rationale to hold: if the CE link (v s , v t ) is rejected, a possible driver-target relationship between nodes v s and v t is destroyed, thus nullifying the argument for the simultaneous rejection of edge (v 1 , v t ).</s><s>The same argument holds vice versa: a rejection of the tagged edge (v 1 , v t ) due to CD destroys the information cascade from v s to v t and thus cancels the CE causing the detection of (v s , v t ).</s><s>Thus, tagging both edges in a triangle motif yields a slightly too conservative approach to network representation.</s><s>For the treatment of tagged links in neuroscience we refer to the Discussion section.</s></p><p><s>A further important consideration is that once the algorithm has detected an alternative path v a ⇝ v b for an edge (v a , v b ), this alternative path stays intact, even if, at a later step, some edge in v a ⇝ v b is tagged (and probably removed).</s><s>Assume, that we have an edge (v a , v b ) with an alternative path v a ⇝ v b and that at a later step, one or more edges in this path get tagged.</s><s>Then, for each of these tagged edges, leaving a 'gap' in v a ⇝ v b , an alternative path of equal summed weight exists by definition of the algorithm.</s><s>This alternative path closes the "gap" in v a ⇝ v b , such that nodes v a and v b are still connected by a new path v a 0 ⇝ v b 0 .</s><s>This new path has the same summed delay as v a ⇝ v b , but is graphically longer.</s><s>Therefore, alternative paths identified at some step in the algorithm remain intact even if links within the paths are tagged at a later point in the algorithm's execution.</s></p><p><s>Implementation overview.</s><s>We now present the implementation of the strategy described above; more precisely, we present an algorithm that finds all alternative paths for any given edge (v a , v b ) 2 E, given a directed, weighted graph G = {V, E}.</s><s>See As a preprocessing step, we construct a graph G 0 by removing the edge (v a , v b ) from G and relabeling nodes v a , v b as starting and target nodes v s , v t of the current iteration of the algorithm.</s><s>The target weight of the alternative path is set to w crit = w (v a , vb) + θ.</s><s>Furthermore, G 0 is represented as an inverted adjacency list, i.e., a list of all nodes in V, where for every node all of its predecessors are listed.</s><s>v s is set as the first node in this list (note that we assume that v s has index 1), v t is set as the last node (has index jVj).</s><s>Therefore, for all other nodes v j in the adjacency list it now holds that 2 j jVj.</s></p><p><s>After preprocessing the input, alternative paths v s ⇝ v t with weight w (v s , vt) ± θ are detected in two steps: (1) a memoized dynamic programming approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is used to determine, whether any path v s ⇝ v t of a total weight w (v s , vt) ± θ exists;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment of tagged links in neuroscience applications</head><p><s>Our algorithm tags potentially spurious edges to let the user decide if a tagged edge should be ultimately excluded from the network representation.</s><s>To minimize erroneous exclusions, the user may inform the decision by additional evidence, e.g.</s><s>previous anatomical or functional findings.</s><s>If such previous findings do not exist, we recommend the exclusion of tagged edges.</s></p><p><s>We consider the erroneous rejection of links favorable over erroneous inclusion, i.e., we suggest to rather commit a false negative error if in doubt.</s><s>We favor false negative errors because in statistical terms, false negatives are considered less severe than false positives (erroneously including a spurious link), as they yield more conservative results.</s><s>If the user removes all tagged links, the resulting network is guaranteed to contain non-spurious links only, but some links may be missing from the network.</s></p><p><s>In triangle motifs, the exclusion of all tagged links will definitely lead to false negatives: Here, two links are tagged but the exclusion of both edges is mutually exclusive; more precisely, the exclusion of one of the two tagged edges destroys the motif giving rise to the second, potentially spurious link.</s><s>This is illustrated in Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>, where the exclusion of link (v 1 , v t ) destroys the CE leading to the tagging of edge (v s , v t ), and on the other hand, the exclusion of (v s , v t ) destroys the CD leading to the tagging of (v 1 , v t ).</s><s>In triangle motifs, the rejection of both edges thus produces a false negative error; here, prior anatomical or functional evidence are required to decide which of the two tagged edges is non-spurious.</s></p><p><s>It is further possible to use modeling approaches to test if tagged links are actually present in the network of bivariate interactions.</s><s>For example dynamic causal modeling (DCM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>) may be used to test whether a model containing a certain link is favorable given the observed data over a second model missing this link.</s></p></div>

Analyzing the triplet of nodes simultaneously will however detect an interaction; e.g. the conditional mutual information (TE) will be greater than zero, because it "decodes" the information in one source by conditioning on the second source.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, synergistic effects between a set of sources and a target node can only be revealed if the whole set is considered simultaneously in some multivariate reconstruction of interactions or by explicitly reconstructing synergistic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>.</s><s>Such synergistic effects are not targeted by design of our algorithm as it simply post-processes results from bivariate network analyses.</s><s>To include synergistic effects, a multivariate interaction analysis would have to replace the estimation of bivariate interactions.</s><s>Note however, that any fully multivariate method for interaction reconstruction would need to identify the optimal subset of sources that exert some meaningful influence on a given target node.</s><s>The identification of such an optimal set of sources would require the exhaustive testing of the power set PðVÞ of all network sources, due to the non-additivity of information contributions from individual sources (because of redundant and synergistic effects).</s><s>The power set has size jPðVÞj ¼ 2 jVj , i.e., testing all sources brute force has a theoretical running time of O(2 jVj ).</s><s>In fact, it has been shown that optimal subset selection in regression is an NP-hard problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>This proof extends to source selection for TE due to the equality of TE with Granger causality for jointly Gaussian variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the reconstruction of truly multivariate interactions in arbitrarily large networks poses a computationally intractable problem (if P 6 ¼ NP).</s><s>In the next subsection we will present approaches that try to approximate fully multivariate methods to circumvent the inherent computational complexity of the problem at hand.</s></p></div>
