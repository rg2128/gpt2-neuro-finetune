<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale and implementation of the algorithmic solution</head><p><s>Rationale of the algorithm.</s><s>Based on the graph representation of reconstructed directed interactions, their delays, and the theoretical preliminaries presented in the last subsection, we will now propose an algorithm that detects potentially spurious interactions by exploiting the timing signature of CE and simple CD.</s></p><p><s>As input the algorithm expects a directed, delay-weighted graph G â {V, E}, represented by its connectivity matrix.</s><s>Connections are weighted with the estimated interaction delays</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w Ã°v a ;v b Ã Â¼ dÃ°v a ;v b Ã , i.e.</formula><p><s>, the estimated physical delays between the processes represented by v a and v b .</s><s>Note that such a graph needs to be constructed from a connectivity measure, which is (a) directed and (b) allows for the reconstruction of interaction delays.</s><s>Additionally, the user has to provide a threshold Î¸ to account for noise in empirical measurements as well as imprecision in analysis methods (described in detail below).</s><s>We furthermore assume that weights have been linearly scaled, such that they do not have any decimal places and can be represented by integer values.</s><s>As a first step, we identify potential CEs by assuming that if a CE is present in the data, the bivariate interaction represented by any edge (v a , v b ) 2 E with weight w (v a , vb) can be explained by an alternative routing of information via intermediate vertices (see an example in Fig <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, iteratively for every edge (v a , v b ) in E the algorithm sets v a = v s as the starting and v b = v t as the target node of the current iteration.</s><s>Then the algorithm searches for an alternative path for (v s , v t ), where a path is assumed to be an alternative path if the summed delay interaction times â i w (v i , vi+1) of all edges in the path are (approximatively) equal to w (v s , vt) , i.e., w (v s , vt) -Î¸ &lt; â i w (v i , vi+1) &lt; w (v s , vt) + Î¸.</s><s>For an example see Fig <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, where edge (v s , v t ) (dashed arrow) has a graphically longer, alternative path hv s , v 1 , v 2 , v t i with equal summed weight (solid arrows).</s><s>If the algorithm finds such an alternative path, the edge currently under investigation is tagged as potentially spurious.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(v i , v j ) edge from v i to v j w (v i , vj) weight of edge (v i , v j ) v i â v j path from v i to v j v i â k v j path from v i to v j with</formula><p><s>In a second step, the algorithm additionally identifies potential simple CD effects based on the results from the first analysis step.</s><s>Simple CD effects occur in graph motifs that form acyclic "triangles" (Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>We define an acyclic triangle as any three nodes that are acyclic, pairwise connected.</s><s>We suspect a spurious link due to simple CD if a triangle motif exhibits a suspicious timing signature; these suspicious triangles are identified from the results of the first analysis step by listing all edges with alternative paths of graphical length two.</s><s>We propose to tag two edges in each of these identified triangles: (1) the direct edge due to a CE (edge (v s , v t ) in Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) the second edge due to a simple CD (edge (v 1 , v t ) in Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>Note however, that of both tagged edges one has to be a non-spurious interaction for this rationale to hold: if the CE link (v s , v t ) is rejected, a possible driver-target relationship between nodes v s and v t is destroyed, thus nullifying the argument for the simultaneous rejection of edge (v 1 , v t ).</s><s>The same argument holds vice versa: a rejection of the tagged edge (v 1 , v t ) due to CD destroys the information cascade from v s to v t and thus cancels the CE causing the detection of (v s , v t ).</s><s>Thus, tagging both edges in a triangle motif yields a slightly too conservative approach to network representation.</s><s>For the treatment of tagged links in neuroscience we refer to the Discussion section.</s></p><p><s>A further important consideration is that once the algorithm has detected an alternative path v a â v b for an edge (v a , v b ), this alternative path stays intact, even if, at a later step, some edge in v a â v b is tagged (and probably removed).</s><s>Assume, that we have an edge (v a , v b ) with an alternative path v a â v b and that at a later step, one or more edges in this path get tagged.</s><s>Then, for each of these tagged edges, leaving a 'gap' in v a â v b , an alternative path of equal summed weight exists by definition of the algorithm.</s><s>This alternative path closes the "gap" in v a â v b , such that nodes v a and v b are still connected by a new path v a 0 â v b 0 .</s><s>This new path has the same summed delay as v a â v b , but is graphically longer.</s><s>Therefore, alternative paths identified at some step in the algorithm remain intact even if links within the paths are tagged at a later point in the algorithm's execution.</s></p><p><s>Implementation overview.</s><s>We now present the implementation of the strategy described above;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application in neuroscience</head><p><s>Based on findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we propose to identify spurious links by their characteristic timing signatures in networks of reconstructed bivariate interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, we propose that a link is likely to be spurious if an alternative path with identical timing exists (Fig <ref type="figure">2)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We assume that a bivariate information transfer between two nodes and a corresponding alternative path constitute a redundant routing of information.</s><s>Such a redundant routing conflicts with the hypothesis that the brain evolves under the objective of maximizing economy and efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> while minimizing biological costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> (see for example the "save-wire hypothesis" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>).</s><s>We thus argue that any redundant routing of information between two sources of neural activity -with identical timing-would be implausible, given the brain's organizational principles.</s><s>Therefore, whenever a redundant routing for a bivariate information transfer is found, our rationale implies spuriousness of either the bivariate information transfer or the alternative path.</s><s>Of the two, we consider the bivariate interaction spurious, because (1) spurious bivariate interactions are a likely artifact in bivariate analysis of multi-node networks; and (2) if a bivariate and thereby direct means of information transfer between a source and a target existed, the maintenance of a physiologically more costly alternative path of identical information transfer would be unlikely.</s></p><p><s>Note, that this rationale exclusively applies to neural systems.</s><s>Also remember, that the algorithm does not tag all alternative routings of information, but only those with a certain timing signature; alternative routings with different delays than the bivariate interaction are not considered redundant and are not tagged.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment of tagged links in neuroscience applications</head><p><s>Our algorithm tags potentially spurious edges to let the user decide if a tagged edge should be ultimately excluded from the network representation.</s><s>To minimize erroneous exclusions, the user may inform the decision by additional evidence, e.g.</s><s>previous anatomical or functional findings.</s><s>If such previous findings do not exist, we recommend the exclusion of tagged edges.</s></p><p><s>We consider the erroneous rejection of links favorable over erroneous inclusion, i.e., we suggest to rather commit a false negative error if in doubt.</s><s>We favor false negative errors because in statistical terms, false negatives are considered less severe than false positives (erroneously including a spurious link), as they yield more conservative results.</s><s>If the user removes all tagged links, the resulting network is guaranteed to contain non-spurious links only, but some links may be missing from the network.</s></p><p><s>In triangle motifs, the exclusion of all tagged links will definitely lead to false negatives: Here, two links are tagged but the exclusion of both edges is mutually exclusive; more precisely, the exclusion of one of the two tagged edges destroys the motif giving rise to the second, potentially spurious link.</s><s>This is illustrated in Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>, where the exclusion of link (v 1 , v t ) destroys the CE leading to the tagging of edge (v s , v t ), and on the other hand, the exclusion of (v s , v t ) destroys the CD leading to the tagging of (v 1 , v t ).</s><s>In triangle motifs, the rejection of both edges thus produces a false negative error; here, prior anatomical or functional evidence are required to decide which of the two tagged edges is non-spurious.</s></p><p><s>It is further possible to use modeling approaches to test if tagged links are actually present in the network of bivariate interactions.</s><s>For example dynamic causal modeling (DCM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>) may be used to test whether a model containing a certain link is favorable given the observed data over a second model missing this link.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Types of multivariate effects not identified by the algorithm</head><p><s>The correction performed by the presented algorithm is not exhaustive with respect to all types of multivariate interactions potentially occurring in neuroscience data.</s><s>The interactions not targeted by the algorithm are of two types: (1) more general cases of CD; (2) synergistic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, i.e., combined effects of two or more sources on a third source.</s><s>In the following we will discuss the conceptual and practical limitations that prevent an exhaustive algorithmic correction for these two types of multivariate interactions.</s></p><p><s>Detection of general common drive effects.</s><s>The presented algorithm detects simple CD in triangle motifs by listing all links with alternative paths of length two.</s><s>Our algorithm can theoretically be extended to explicitly search for general cases of CD, where two nodes are commonly driven via arbitrarily long cascades of information transfer (Fig <ref type="figure">2A)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>General CD may be identified by searching for paths of equal summed interaction delays that have a common source and target node.</s><s>We again assume that equal summed delays hint at redundant and therefore spurious information transfer.</s><s>It can then be tested if the source node is a common driver for the last and second to last node in one of the two paths by looking at the information transfer delay between these last two nodes.</s><s>For an example, see Fig <ref type="figure">2A,</ref><ref type="figure"></ref> where the bivariate information transfer in the network forms two paths of equal delays connecting nodes v 0 and v t : The link (v s , v t ) is tagged as spurious because its weight corresponds to the difference in the summed path weights v 0 â c 0 v s and v 0 â c v t : w (v s , vt) = cc 0 .</s><s>In this scenario, v 0 is a common driver of nodes v s and v t .</s><s>This approach also allows to test for higher order CD, i.e., one source driving three or more nodes simultaneously.</s><s>A similar algorithm was proposed by Marinazzo and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> to identify spurious bivariate links using a network of multivariately reconstructed interactions (see next section).</s></p><p><s>Even though an extension to general CD is hypothetically possible, its realization is not feasible in practice: The extension requires that for each network node all originating paths of arbitrary length need to be listed.</s><s>An algorithm fulfilling this task would have an asymptotic running time many times higher than the algorithm presented in this work: For each node in V, O(jV -1j!) paths of arbitrary length and weight exist (in the first step O(jVj -1) nodes can be reached from the current starting node, in the second step O(jVj -2) nodes can be reached, and so forth).</s><s>The asymptotic running time of such an algorithm thus amounts to O(jVj Ã jV -1j!).</s><s>Such a factorial running time is commonly not considered feasible in practice and would limit the application to networks of very small size.</s></p><p><s>Detection of synergistic effects.</s><s>Synergistic effects describe information that is transferred from a set of sources to a common target, whereby information is combined in a non-trivial fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>.</s><s>In this case, looking at the set of sources simultaneously provides information about the target that is not obtainable from looking at each source separately.</s><s>As a toy example, one can think of three nodes implementing a logical XOR operator, where two nodes serve as binary input and the third node serves as output node.</s><s>Each state of the output node is the exclusive OR of the two previous input states.</s><s>A bivariate analysis of every pairwise interaction between the three nodes will not detect any significant interaction, because the pairwise mutual information between any two nodes is 0. Analyzing the triplet of nodes simultaneously will however detect an interaction; e.g. the conditional mutual information (TE) will be greater than zero, because it "decodes" the information in one source by conditioning on the second source.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, synergistic effects between a set of sources and a target node can only be revealed if the whole set is considered simultaneously in some multivariate reconstruction of interactions or by explicitly reconstructing synergistic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>.</s><s>Such synergistic effects are not targeted by design of our algorithm as it simply post-processes results from bivariate network analyses.</s><s>To include synergistic effects, a multivariate interaction analysis would have to replace the estimation of bivariate interactions.</s><s>Note however, that any fully multivariate method for interaction reconstruction would need to identify the optimal subset of sources that exert some meaningful influence on a given target node.</s><s>The identification of such an optimal set of sources would require the exhaustive testing of the power set PÃ°VÃ of all network sources, due to the non-additivity of information contributions from individual sources (because of redundant and synergistic effects).</s><s>The power set has size jPÃ°VÃj Â¼ 2 jVj , i.e., testing all sources brute force has a theoretical running time of O(2 jVj ).</s><s>In fact, it has been shown that optimal subset selection in regression is an NP-hard problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>This proof extends to source selection for TE due to the equality of TE with Granger causality for jointly Gaussian variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the reconstruction of truly multivariate interactions in arbitrarily large networks poses a computationally intractable problem (if P 6 Â¼ NP).</s><s>In the next subsection we will present approaches that try to approximate fully multivariate methods to circumvent the inherent computational complexity of the problem at hand.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison to other approximative methods for multivariate network reconstruction</head><p><s>The proposed algorithm provides an approximative method for the inference of networks of multivariate interactions to handle the computational intractability of exact network reconstruction.</s><s>Methods with a similar purpose have been proposed by various authors.</s><s>In the following we will review some of these methods and list scenarios that may benefit from the application of our algorithm.</s></p><p><s>Non-uniform multivariate embedding by Faes and colleagues.</s><s>Faes and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> proposed a non-uniform embedding technique to estimate the information transfer from one source variable to a target in the presence of further potentially relevant sources of information transfer.</s><s>The authors propose to iteratively build a non-uniform embedding vector from a set of candidate time points from the past of all sources in a network up to a certain predefined limit.</s><s>Points are included in the vector if they add significant information about the next state of the target.</s><s>Information transfer between a source and a target may then be estimated while conditioning on this non-uniform embedding vector.</s></p><p><s>The iterative construction of the embedding vector follows a greedy strategy that is similar to the strategies discussed above <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, the returned embedding vector is not guaranteed to yield the set of maximally informative source time points with respect to the target, as it will miss purely synergistic contributions of two or more points to the target.</s><s>As said above, an exhaustive testing of all possible subsets of source time points poses an intractable computational problem.</s><s>This is explained next.</s></p><p><s>Exhaustive brute force analysis.</s><s>A brute force analysis of interactions between all possible subsets (m-tuples) in a set of nodes would yield an exact solution to the problem of inferring the network of multivariate interactions from data.</s><s>For the example of m = 3, one would enumerate all 3-tuples or triplets in the set of nodes and for each triplet evaluate the six possible interaction motifs-three potential targets and for each target two possible combinations of source and conditioning node.</s><s>Note that here the mandatory conditioning takes care of potential synergies.</s><s>For the general case of m-tuples, this would generalize to jVj m Ã Ã possible subsets of size m, where for each tuple m Ã (m -1) possible interaction motifs exist.</s><s>As for approximative approaches, such an analysis is feasible for small numbers of m only.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application scenarios for the proposed algorithm</head><p><s>The most basic application scenario for the proposed algorithm is as post-processing step after bivariate reconstruction of directed, delay-weighted interactions from a set of neural sources.</s><s>Here, the algorithm helps to prune potentially spurious edges to obtain an approximative, statistically conservative network representation of the physical interactions.</s><s>In this scenario, our algorithmic correction is favorable over multivariate interaction reconstruction whenever available data is limited or high-dimensional, such that data points are not sufficient to estimate highly multivariate interactions.</s><s>Here, our algorithm is more data-efficient because it relies on bivariate interaction reconstruction only.</s><s>Such data-efficiency is especially relevant for information theoretic measures, where quantities are often estimated using kernel estimators or neighbor methods (as for example proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>); applying these kernel estimators to the estimation of highly multivariate data may lead to very high dimensional search spaces, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality, hindering a reliable estimation of the quantities of interest.</s></p><p><s>The application of our algorithm may prove beneficial prior to calculating graph theoretical measures from networks of reconstructed interactions.</s><s>We argue that these measures are more reliable when applied to a statistically conservative network representation.</s></p><p><s>The algorithm may further be used in conjunction with modeling approaches such as DCM, where it serves to limit the model space to be tested.</s><s>DCM may also help to identify the most plausible network representation from models, after in-and excluding individual tagged edges respectively.</s></p><p><s>The presented algorithm may further serve as a preprocessing step for trivariate estimation of information transfer: By testing only the triangle motifs identified by the algorithm, the number of necessary information transfer estimations reduces drastically compared to the brute-force approach discussed in the last subsection.</s><s>Necessary estimations include bivariate interaction reconstruction (jVj Ã (jVj -1) calculations for jVj nodes) and subsequent multivariate interaction reconstruction for identified triangle motifs.</s><s>The actual number of multivariate reconstructions depends on the number of motifs: The approach is asymptotically faster if 90% or less of the possible jVj 3 Ã Ã triangle motifs are actually present in the data (for network sizes jVj &gt; 12).</s><s>Trivariate estimation of TE has been implemented in TRENTOOL <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which also includes the reference implementation of the proposed algorithm.</s><s>Thus, both analyses may be used in conjunction to estimate multivariate TE of order three.</s><s>An extension to higher orders is theoretically possible although not implemented as it is not deemed feasible for practical purposes.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the algorithm is especially suitable for the application in simulated networks where all information transfers have a delay of unity, such as elementary cellular automata, and spurious interactions are therefore easily found.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .Fig 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
