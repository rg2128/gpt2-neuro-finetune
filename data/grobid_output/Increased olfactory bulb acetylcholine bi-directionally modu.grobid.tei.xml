Cameron Ogg, Matthew Ennis &amp; Max L. Fletcher</head><p><s>The glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb (OB) receives heavy cholinergic input from the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) and expresses both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors.</s><s>However, the effects of ACh on OB glomerular odor responses remain unknown.</s><s>Using calcium imaging in transgenic mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP2 in the mitral/tufted cells, we investigated the effect of ACh on the glomerular responses to increasing odor concentrations.</s><s>Using HDB electrical stimulation and in vivo pharmacology, we find that increased OB ACh leads to dynamic, activity-dependent bi-directional modulation of glomerular odor response due to the combinatorial effects of both muscarinic and nicotinic activation.</s><s>Using pharmacological manipulation to reveal the individual receptor type contributions, we find that m2 muscarinic receptor activation increases glomerular sensitivity to weak odor input whereas nicotinic receptor activation decreases sensitivity to strong input.</s><s>Overall, we found that ACh in the OB increases glomerular sensitivity to odors and decreases activation thresholds.</s><s>This effect, along with the decreased responses to strong odor input, reduces the response intensity range of individual glomeruli to increasing concentration making them more similar across the entire concentration range.</s><s>As a result, odor representations are more similar as concentration increases.</s></p><p><s>Odors are detected by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the nasal cavity that express a single receptor type.</s><s>OSNs project their axons into specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB) where they form excitatory synapses onto a complex circuit of interneurons and mitral/tufted (M/T) cells.</s><s>This convergence forms the basis of the glomerular odor map whereby odor information is represented by distinct spatio-temporal patterns of M/T cell apical dendrite glomerular activity.</s></p><p><s>Cholinergic innervation of the OB arises from the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>These fibers terminate densely in the glomerular layer and moderately in the sub-glomerular layers.</s><s>This projection pattern is paralleled by expression of muscarinic and nicotinic ACh

in arousal, attention, and learning.</s><s>During active, awake states, cholinergic neurons display increased activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and are active during odor investigation and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, cortical ACh release is increased by novel sensory stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and by arousing or aversive events <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>ACh release is hypothesized to have several effects including cue detection, enhancing sensory coding of salient stimuli, and facilitating memory encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have demonstrated that ACh release and activation of AChRs facilitate olfactory learning, memory, odor discrimination, and generalization <ref

target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> .</s><s>However, the mechanisms by which ACh release facilitates these behaviors are not understood, especially in terms of OB odor processing.</s><s>Previous in vitro electrophysiology studies have shown that ACh or cholinergic agonists can exert excitatory or inhibitory effects that depend on cell (M/T vs. inhibitory interneurons) and AChR subtype <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>How these varying cellular effects impact odor responses has been less well studied.</s><s>More recent in vivo studies using optogenetic approaches have demonstrated that activation of HDB ACh neurons or ACh fibers in the OB can lead to both increases and decreases in M/T cell odor responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s></p><p><s>However, several questions remain regarding the function of ACh modulation of OB odor processing, especially in terms of glomerular odor representation.</s><s>The glomerular layer is the most heavily targeted by HDB ACh input <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and contains cholinoreceptive cell types expressing muscarinic (mAChR) and nicotinic (nAChR) receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Despite this, it is still unknown if and how synaptically-released ACh modulates M/T cell glomerular odor responses to OSN input, and if potential ACh actions vary with odor intensity and the AChR types involved.</s></p><p><s>Here, we used transgenic mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP2 in OB M/T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> to investigate cholinergic modulation of M/T cell glomerular odor representations in vivo.</s><s>Overall, we find that increased OB ACh release via HDB stimulation or pharmacological activation leads to dynamic, activity-dependent modulation of glomerular odor sensitivity, resulting in increased individual glomerular sensitivity to weaker odor input and decreased sensitivity to stronger odor input.</s><s>Further, through the use of direct OB pharmacological manipulation, we demonstrate that the increased sensitivity is due to m2R activation, while the decreased sensitivity is due to nicotinic receptor activation.</s><s>The interplay between these two receptor types leads to more similar overall glomerular representations of a given odorant across a large range of odor concentrations.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HDB stimulation bidirectionally affects individual glomerular odor responses depending on relative odor intensity.</head><p><s>The distribution of HDBS responses as a function of the control responses showed that reductions in odor responses following HDBS occur more often with stronger glomerular control responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>This suggested a possible relationship between the strength of the control response and the effect of HDBS, where the weaker responses are enhanced and the strong ones reduced.</s><s>However, responses to the same odorant at the same concentration may be increased by HDBS in some glomeruli and decreased in others, suggesting that the relationship occurs relative to individual glomerular responses rather than the absolute intensity of the odor stimulus.</s><s>To investigate this, the effects of HDBS on individual glomeruli were tested across a large range of odorant concentrations.</s><s>This revealed that HDBS enhanced responses to low odorant concentrations and suppressed responses to high odorant concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>To further address this relationship, we normalized the control and HDBS-evoked responses for every glomerulus to its maximum response in control conditions, and plotted them as function of Log odor concentration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>We then compared individual odor-concentration-response curves in both control and HDBS conditions in 188 glomeruli obtained from 15 mice (972 pre-post HDBS pairings).</s><s>This revealed that odor responses to relatively weak and moderate odor concentrations were increased, while vigorous responses evoked by near maximal concentrations were reduced in individual glomeruli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Differences in individual glomerular sensitivity to a given odorant within and between animals, i.e. a given concentration induces a weak response in some glomeruli and a strong response in others, can make it difficult to extract mean population effects.</s><s>Therefore, we pooled the control and HDBS normalized responses and plotted the average control and the corresponding HDBS normalized responses as a function of normalized control maximal response for each glomerulus binned in 10%-amplitude intervals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>One-way ANOVA showed differences between control and HDBS normalized responses across all intervals (F(21, 1600) = 203.2,</s><s>p &lt; 0.0001); post hoc Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests were then used to compare the control and the corresponding HDBS responses for each interval.</s><s>As expected, the average normalized control yielded a linear plot of increasing responses towards the normalized maximum for all glomeruli.</s><s>The average normalized HDBS response curve exhibited a significant shift upward reflecting enhanced responses for all intervals below 80% of the maximum response) with increases ranging from 21.2 ± 1.8% to 34.0 ± 2.8%.</s><s>Above the 80% interval, the HDBS curve intersects the control curve (i.e., no response change) followed by a significant shift downward, with a 15.8 ± 1.5% decrease of the average normalized maximum response (100%).</s><s>Together, these results indicate that ACh release enhances odor response over much of the dynamic range of an individual glomerulus, with suppression occurring at relatively high odor concentrations that drive strong responses approaching the saturation limit.</s></p></div>

By decreasing the intensity of maximum odor responses, ACh could reduce the total magnitude of the responses' intensity range.</s><s>This hypothesis implies that HDBS may induce variation in two parameters, the odor concentration range that induces a measurable response and the response intensity.</s><s>Because these parameters may be dependent on each other, when studying one parameter, we fixed the other parameter by normalizing the responses to the maximum response of either each condition (pre-and HDBS) or only control (pre-) condition (see Methods).</s></p><p><s>To investigate the first parameter, i.e. the effect of HDBS on the concentration range that elicits measurable glomerular responses, for each glomerulus, we fixed the response intensity parameter by normalizing the experimentally obtained odor responses to the maximum response for each condition.</s><s>We obtained a full response range from 0 to 100% for each condition, which allowed us to assess the effects of HDBS on the concentration range in every condition regardless of its effect on induced response intensity.</s><s>We fit the normalized responses to sigmoid curves as function of Log odor concentration as previously described in control and HDBS conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>).</s><s>Then, we compared the Log concentrations that elicited 10%, 50% and 90% of the maximum response for each condition (respectively Log EC10, Log EC50 and Log EC90) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>).</s><s>As expected, HDBS significantly shifted the Log EC10 by 0.93 Log units towards lower concentrations (control Log EC10: -1.53 ± 0.05; HDBS Log EC10: -2.46 ± 0.05, df = 103, t = 16.46,</s><s>p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>A smaller shift of the Log EC50 (by 0.5 Log units) was induced by HDBS (control LogEC50: -1.13 ± 0.05; HDBS LogEC50: -1.63 ± 0.04, t = 14.67, df = 103, n = 104, p &lt;

0.001).</s><s>Consequently, the concentration range that elicits responses between the lower and higher plateaus of the curve broadens <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>These data indicate that HDBS decreases the theoretical odor concentration needed to elicit threshold responses but does not change the concentration that evokes the maximum responses, regardless of their absolute value.</s><s>To experimentally verify this finding based on theoretical sigmoid fit, we identified a subset of glomeruli that displayed sub-threshold responses at weak odor concentrations under control conditions.</s><s>We then compared their relative to maximum control Δ F/F at that concentration in control and HDBS conditions.</s><s>In these glomeruli, HDBS significantly increased responses above threshold (control = 5.2 ± 0.5%, HDBS = 39.7 ± 4.9%, paired t-test, t = 6.83, df = 27, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>Overall, HDBS broadens the range of concentrations that elicit odor responses by increasing glomerular sensitivity to relatively weak odor input and decreasing glomerular activation threshold.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the second parameter, i.e. the effect of HDBS on response intensity, we studied the variation of responses normalized to control maximum response while fixing the concentrations to the concentration range between control Log EC10 and Log EC90.</s><s>Theoretical projections based on the sigmoid fit show that the possible odor responses are constrained to a smaller interval after HDBS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E</ref>).</s><s>To further confirm this finding and translate it to our experimental data, we compared the normalized minimum responses [0-10%[ and the maximum possible response at 100% in the control condition to the corresponding normalized HDBS response.</s><s>We found that HDBS increased the average response to concentrations that induced control responses in the [0-10%[ interval (control = 5.2 ± 0.5%, HDBS = 39.7 ± 4.9%, paired t-test, t = 6.83, df = 27, p &lt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We find that increased OB ACh leads to bidirectional, activity-dependent modulation of M/T cell glomerular odor responses whereby weak-to-moderate responses are enhanced and strong responses are reduced.</s><s>This effect was observed regardless of odorant, glomerular spatial location or baseline glomerular sensitivity.</s><s>Further, this enhancement is due to activation of m2R while reduction of nearly saturated responses with high odorant concentrations is due to nAChR activation.</s><s>Together, these mechanisms serve to increase the similarity of glomerular odor representations across a wider concentration range.</s></p><p><s>The bidirectional modulation of individual glomerular response was similar whether HDBS or OB neostigmine application was used.</s><s>These results, together with findings that OB AChR agonists and antagonists respectively mimicked or blocked the effects of HDBS, strongly suggest that the observed modulation is due to direct actions of ACh within the OB and not due to centrifugal influences from other brain regions affected by HDBS.</s><s>Despite the presence of GABAergic HDB projection neurons, we found that HDBS effects on M/T cell glomerular odor response can be completely explained through cholinergic activation, leaving the role of HDB GABAergic projections unclear.</s></p><p><s>Based upon previous M/T cell glomerular calcium imaging studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , the majority of the odor-evoked glomerular signal reflects activity in the distal dendrites of excitatory cells with little representation of deeper somatic activity.</s><s>Thus, the changes reported here likely reflect modulation of M/T cell dendritic glomerular responses to OSN input and may not reflect cholinergic modulation at deeper OB layers.</s><s>Our findings fit well with findings of both increased and decreased M/T somatic odor responses following optogenetic HDB stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> and suggest that at least part of the somatic odor responses modulation is due to the cholinergic effects seen at the glomerular level.</s><s>A more recent study using optogenetic stimulation of OB ACh fibers reported only response increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>These differences could be due to location of stimulation (OB versus HDB), differences in stimulation protocols, or lack of high intensity odor stimulation where we observe the inhibitory effects.</s></p><p><s>Both nAChRs and mAChRs are present in the glomerular layer and both subtypes can influence output cells and interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .

.</s><s>Our results are the first to describe how n-and mAChR work individually and together to modulate glomerular responses based on the intensity of the sensory input.</s></p><p><s>With nAChR activation, we found an intensity-dependent suppression of glomerular activity that decreased strong odor responses engaged by higher odorant concentrations.</s><s>While the mechanism for this effect is not known, the fact that this supression is stronger at high intensities suggests that it is possibly due to feedback inhibtion.</s><s>Nicotinic activation can induce glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> as well as the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>In the OB, increased glutamate release is thought to excite PG cells and

lower concentration range with neostigmine than with HDBS or nicotinic agonists.</s><s>Previous work has demonstrated that stronger basal forebrain stimulation causes stronger nAChR effects on cortical receptive field sharpening <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> suggesting that nAChR activation is sensitive to ACh levels.</s><s>The neostigmine concentration used here likely lead to maximal and tonically elevated OB ACh concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , while brief HDBS produces a phasic increase in ACh.</s><s>Consistent with this, odor responses returned to control values within minutes of HDBS while neostigmine effects persisted for over 60 minutes (data not shown).</s><s>Higher ACh levels produced by neostigmine may explain why the nAChR-driven inhibition occurred at lower odor concentrations compared to the HDBS.</s><s>It is noteworthy that neostigmine combined with the mAChR blocker scopolamine induced decreases of weaker responses compared to nicotine (10 μ M) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>This may be due to the concentration of nicotine used.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, mAChR activation leads to increased responses at all odor concentrations.</s><s>This was observed following HDBS or neostigmine in combination with nAChR antagonists, as well as with a mAChR agonist.</s><s>In all of these conditions, mAChR activation leads to a similar increase in response magnitude at all odor concentrations, suggesting that this effect is likely a gain shift.</s><s>As both m1R and m2R are located in the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , we explored the potential role of these receptor types in mediating the increased

response suppression expected at higher intensities.</s><s>Further, application of an m1R agonist alone had no effect on responses.</s><s>Together, these results demonstrate that the increased

responses in the mid-to high concentration range and non-activity dependent mAChR-mediated enhancement of response across all concentrations.</s><s>When both receptors are engaged, the nicotinic effect overcomes the excitatory muscarinic effect to produce inhibition at near saturating odor responses while leaving the enhanced responsivity at lower concentrations unchanged.</s><s>Thus, the direction of glomerular response modulation is dependent upon its relative control odor response amplitude and can be predicted from the baseline odor responses of a given odorant.</s><s>As previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> primarily used fixed or relatively low odor intensities, the bidirectional

constancy, a phenomenon in which the perception of the odorant remains stable across varying concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Further, as OB AChR activation enhances sub-threshold responses, ACh release could increase odor sensitivity, i.e. lower detection thresholds.</s><s>In line with this, scopolamine injections decrease peri-threshold odor detection in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>However, a study in rats reported that odor detection thresholds were not affected by OB infusion of the AChR agonist carbachol in an odor investigation/habituation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , perhaps due to the opposing m-and nAChR actions of this
