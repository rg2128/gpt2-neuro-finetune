<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Participants.</s><s>Thirty-six right-handed neurologically normal adults (mean age, 27.2 years; SD, 5.2, range, 19 -36 years; 18 male), 12 of whom participated in the event-related fMRI study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fan et al., 2005)</ref>, participated this study.</s><s>Participants had normal or corrected to normal vision.</s><s>A signed informed consent was obtained from each participant before the experiment.</s></p><p><s>Attention network test.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the schematic of the ANT.</s><s>Stimuli consisted of a row of five horizontal black lines, with arrowheads pointing left or right, against a gray background (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, two target conditions).</s><s>A single arrow subtended 0.58°of visual angle and the contours of adjacent arrows or lines were separated by 0.06°of visual angle.</s><s>The target was a leftward or rightward arrow at the center, flanked on either side by two arrows in the same direction (congruent condition), or in the opposite direction (incongruent condition).</s><s>The stimuli (one center arrow and four flanker arrows) subtended a total 3.27°of visual angle.</s><s>The participants' task was to identify the direction of the target by pressing one key for the left direction and a second key for the right direction.</s></p><p><s>The row of five arrows was presented in one of two locations, either 1.06°above or below the fixation cross.</s><s>Thus, participants had to shift attention from the fixation point to the target location on each trial to determine the proper response.</s><s>To measure the alerting and orienting benefits, a cue (an asterisk sign) was presented before the appearance of target.</s><s>There were three cue conditions: no cue (baseline), center cue (at the fixation for alerting), and spatial cue (at the target location for alerting plus orienting).</s><s>The operational definitions of the effects of the three attentional networks based on reaction time (RT) were as follows: alerting effect ϭ RT no cue Ϫ RT center cue , orienting effect ϭ RT center cue Ϫ RT spatial cue , and conflict effect ϭ RT incongruent Ϫ RT congruent .</s><s>The same contrasts were used for the calculation of these three effects based on accuracy.</s><s>The contrasts for the alerting and orienting effects were flipped for the fMRI and ERP data analysis (i.e., alerting effect ϭ center cue Ϫ no cue, orienting effect ϭ spatial cue Ϫ center cue).</s><s>For the interpretations of the attentional network scores, see our previous publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fan and Posner, 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Procedures.</s><s>In each trial, depending on the condition, a cue was (center cue or spatial cue condition) or was not (no cue condition) presented for 200 ms.</s><s>After a variable duration (300 -1450 ms with an average of 550 ms), the target (with flankers) was presented until a response was made.</s><s>The time window for participants' response was 2000 ms after target onset.</s><s>The duration between the onset of the target and the start of the next trial was also variable (3000 -4200 ms with a mean of 3300 ms).</s><s>Each trial persisted 4050 ms on average.</s><s>A fixation cross appeared in the center throughout the whole experiment.</s></p><p><s>Participants performed a total of six blocks of trials, each block lasting ϳ8 min.</s><s>Each block consisted of 108 trials plus six buffer trials at beginning of each block.</s><s>Trial order was counterbalanced as in the fMRI study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fan et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible with the left mouse button if the central arrow pointed left and the right mouse button if the central arrow pointed right using their left and right thumbs, respectively.</s><s>The stimuli were the same as those used in the fMRI study except that the intervals between cue and target and between target and next trial were shorter.</s><s>Stimulus presentation and behavioral response collection were performed using E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) on the experimental control personal computer, which was synchronized and communicated with the ERP data recording system.</s><s>The trial events, including the cue and target type, and onset/offset time were sent to the ERP data recording system via a standard serial port.</s></p><p><s>ERP acquisition.</s><s>Electrical data were recorded from 128 scalp sites using the Geodesic EEG Net Station (EGI, Eugene, OR) and the 128channel Geodesic Sensor Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tucker, 1993)</ref>.</s><s>The impedance of all electrodes except bad electrodes (no more than two per session) was Ͻ40 k⍀ at the beginning of the experiment.</s><s>EEG was recorded using a 0.1-100 Hz bandpass filter.</s><s>The signals were sampled at 250 samples/s and were digitized with a 12 bit analog-to-digital converter.</s><s>All recordings were referenced to Cz, then average-referenced off-line.</s></p><p><s>Behavioral data analysis.</s><s>Trials with incorrect responses or with RTs longer than 1000 ms or shorter than 200 ms were excluded.</s><s>The averaged RTs for each of the six combinations (three cue conditions by two target conditions) were calculated.</s><s>The network scores were then calculated based on the operational definitions of the effects of the three attentional networks.</s><s>The mean RTs from the two target conditions under each of the three cue conditions were averaged for the alerting and orienting calculation, and the mean RTs from the three cue conditions were averaged for the two target conditions separately for the calculation of the conflict effect.</s><s>Grand averages of RT and accuracy, and the correlations among network scores were also calculated.</s></p><p><s>ERP data analysis.</s><s>Initial off-line processing of the data was performed using Net Station software (version 2.0; EGI).</s><s>ERPs were filtered using a 60 Hz notch filter before segmentation.</s><s>ERPs for correct trials were segmented into epochs that were time-locked according to cue onset, target onset, or response.</s><s>For the no cue trials, the waveforms during the no cue period were also segmented as if real cue events occurred.</s><s>The average of these no cue segments, which represents the average overlap of adjacent events/trials, served as the baseline.</s><s>The overlapping activity can be subtracted out using this baseline as demonstrated by other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Busse and Woldorff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Talsma and Woldorff, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>The time window was from 200 ms prestimulus to 800 ms poststimulus for both cue and target onset locked segments, and 400 ms before and 400 ms after response for response locked segments.</s><s>Trials containing eye-blink, eye-movements, or an excessive number of bad channels (Ͼ10) were identified using Net Station's moving window algorithm and excluded from additional analysis.</s><s>Trials with incorrect responses were also excluded from additional analysis.</s><s>In remaining trials, data for bad channels were replaced using spherical spline interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Perrin et al., 1987)</ref>.</s><s>Segmented ERP data were then analyzed using Brain Electrical Source Analysis (BESA) 5.1 software (MEGIS Software, Grafelfing, Germany).</s><s>First, epochs for analysis were defined both for the cue period (50 ms before cue onset to 450 ms after cue onset), the target period (100 ms before target onset to 700 ms after target onset), and the response-locked period (300 ms before response to 300 ms after response).</s><s>Because EGI exports both "bad" and "good" segments, a second round of artifact rejection was performed using BESA.</s><s>ERP data from one subject were excluded from the ERP and the subsequent analysis because artifacts during data recording.</s></p><p><s>Power spectrum analysis based on dipole modeling.</s><s>The goal of the In each trial, depending on the cue condition (no cue, center cue, or spatial cue), a cue may appear for 200 ms.</s><s>After a variable duration (300 -1450 ms), the target (the center arrow) and flankers of two left and two right arrows (congruent or incongruent flankers) are presented.</s><s>The participant makes a response to the target's direction within a time window of 2000 ms.</s><s>The target and flankers disappear after the response is made.</s><s>The target and post-target fixation period lasts for a variable duration (3000 -4200 ms).</s></p><p><s>present analysis was to characterize the power changes associated with each attentional function across a wide range of frequencies.</s><s>We first considered performing this analysis by analyzing power changes at the scalp level.</s><s>However, the sensitivity of this method is decreased relative to analysis of power changes at the dipole level because all cortical sources contribute to the signal observed at any given electrode.</s><s>We instead chose to model power changes at the dipole level for this and the following reasons.</s><s>First, dipole-level analysis would allow us to characterize power changes associated with individual structures and, thus, makes it possible to associate power changes with the physical networks supporting each attentional function.</s><s>Second, drawbacks associated with dipole modeling would be minimized because we were able to minimize experimenter bias and partially avoid the inverse problem by constraining dipole locations based on clusters of activation found in our previous fMRI study of the ANT <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fan et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>This was especially advantageous for the purposes of the current study because high-frequency components, such as those in the gamma band, may not be systematically colocalized with average evoked potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tallon-Baudry et al., 2005)</ref>; use of average evoked potentials to estimate dipole locations would present a challenge for the interpretation of changes in power of high-frequency components.</s><s>Although average evoked potentials were used to estimate the direction of dipoles once they were placed, this method may still confer significant advantage over power-change analyses performed at the scalp level.</s></p><p><s>Dipole locations were based on clusters of activation identified in our previous fMRI study of the ANT <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fan et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the coordinates of the dipoles used in each analysis.</s><s>For each condition, separate dipoles were located at the geometric center of mass of each cortically located region of activation as identified in the fMRI data.</s><s>The relative level of activation for each voxel was not considered when calculating the center of mass.</s><s>We followed the method described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Crottaz-Herbette and Menon, 2006)</ref> to exclude brain regions such as the thalamus from dipole modeling that were activated in the fMRI data but that do not exhibit the columnar organization necessary to generate a field that can be recorded on the scalp.</s><s>We also excluded the cerebellum from dipole modeling because the cerebellum generates its own independent electric activity that does not contribute to the scalp recording of the ERP <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Tyner and Knott, 1989)</ref>.</s><s>Dipoles were positioned at the center of mass of all clusters identified in the fMRI study whose anatomical locations met the above criteria.</s><s>Therefore, the alerting network had five dipole sources (the superior colliculus cluster, which had peaks in the left and right thalamus, and the cerebellar vermis cluster were excluded from the original seven clusters), the orienting network had eight dipole sources, and the executive control network had seven dipole sources (the thalamus and cerebellar vermis clusters were excluded from the original nine clusters).</s><s>The dipole positions were fixed and the orientations were allowed to vary.</s><s>Given that the ERP sample was a superset of the fMRI sample, the locations used were an approximation.</s><s>We did not attempt to improve the fit by loosening the location constraint because this would introduce uncertainty.</s><s>Empirical testing has shown that a small degree of deviation of a dipole's location does not significantly affect the model fitting.</s></p><p><s>The grand-averaged difference waveforms of the alerting, orienting, and conflict effects calculated from the cue-, target-, and response-locked ERPs of all participants were used for dipole direction estimation.</s><s>The fitting periods for the cue-locked ERP were 0 -450 ms after cue onset for alerting and orienting effects, 0 -700 ms after target onset for conflict effect, and 300 ms preresponse to 300 ms postresponse for the responselocked analysis.</s><s>To avoid fitting with bias, all dipoles were fitted simultaneously without any additional selection to link an ERP component to a specific dipole during a certain time period.</s><s>Average surface points of the Geodesic Sensor Net provided by BESA were used.</s><s>The BESA source model solutions for each network generated from the grand averaged ERPs were applied as montages to the individual participants' cue-, target-, or response-locked epochs of each trial, and power spectrum analyses were performed in BESA separately for each cue and target condition.</s><s>This method can be defined as analysis of induced activity of frequency bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Senkowski et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For the spectra, time-frequency sampling was 2 Hz/25 ms.</s><s>BESA uses a complex demodulation to transform time-domain data into the timefrequency domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Papp and Ktonas, 1977)</ref>.</s><s>This complex demodulation consists of a multiplication of the time-domain signal with a complex periodic exponential function, with a frequency equal to the frequency under analysis, and a subsequent low-pass filter.</s><s>This low-pass filter is a finite impulse response filter of Gaussian shape in the timedomain, which is related to the envelope of the moving window in wavelet analysis.</s><s>For our setting of a 2 Hz/25 ms time-frequency sampling, this filter has a width in the frequency domain of 5.7 Hz and in the timedomain of 79 ms full width at half maximum.</s><s>For more details about the BESA power spectrum analysis, see a previous publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hoechstetter et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>For sources of each attentional network, power spectra were computed for each trial and then were averaged for each participant under corresponding cue or target conditions.</s></p><p><s>Power changes compared with the average of prestimulus or postresponse baseline period were plotted.</s><s>In the cue conditions (no cue, center cue, spatial cue), the time axis was from 50 ms precue to 450 ms postcue, the frequency axis was from 4 to 100 Hz, and power change was defined as percentage of baseline (the average power of the 50 ms before stimulus onset).</s><s>For the alerting montage, spectra were generated for all five sources in the no cue and center cue conditions, and the alerting effect was shown as the contrast of center cue minus no cue.</s><s>For the orienting montage, spectra were generated for all eight sources in the center cue and spatial cue conditions, and the orienting effect was shown as the contrast of spatial cue minus center cue.</s><s>In the target conditions (congruent and incongruent), the time axis was from 100 ms pretarget to 700 ms post-target, the frequency axis was from 4 to 100 Hz, and power change was defined as percentage of baseline (the average power of the 100 ms before stimulus onset).</s><s>For the response locked analysis, the time axis was from 300 ms preresponse to 300 ms postresponse, and the baseline was 200 -300 ms postresponse.</s><s>For both target-locked and responselocked executive control montages, spectra were generated for all seven dipole sources in the three cue (no cue, center cue, and spatial cue) by two target (incongruent and congruent) conditions, and the conflict effect was shown as the main effect of the difference between the power spectral changes under incongruent and congruent conditions.</s><s>The modulation of the alerting (center) cue and the orienting (spatial) cue on target response was also examined.</s></p><p><s>Averaged power-change plots of each participant corresponding to each condition were filtered separately using a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel with an SD of 6 Hz/75 ms before group analysis.</s><s>This extra step, in addition to using the moving window in the power spectrum analysis, increased the statistical power of group data analysis to detect differences between conditions at the cost of time and frequency resolution.</s><s>This is similar to the use of spatial filers on raw or normalized blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal images to increase the power of statistical analysis for random effects in fMRI analysis.</s><s>To determine the significance of an attentional effect, a paired t test was performed on each data point in the two corresponding filtered power-change spectra.</s><s>A final time-frequency plot was then generated with the color map representing the t value of the power change difference between two conditions at each data point.</s><s>This analysis was performed using Matlab 6.5 software (MathWorks, Natick, MA).</s><s>Assuming an individual voxel type I error of p Ͻ 0.01, a Monte Carlo simulation of the current study revealed that, to correct for multiple comparisons, the finding of significance could only be claimed if 20 contiguous original pixels, regardless of cluster shape, reached significance.</s><s>For example, the finding of ͉t(34)͉ Ͼ 2.73 for each pixel in a cluster of 5 ϫ 4 pixels (10 Hz ϫ 100 ms) was needed for that cluster to reach significance.</s><s>Frequency bands were defined as theta ϭ 4 -8 Hz, alpha ϭ 8 -14 Hz, beta ϭ 14 -30 Hz, and gamma 30 -100 Hz, with no overlap at the edge.</s><s>The beta band includes the lower range beta (14 -18 Hz) and the upper range beta (18 -30 Hz) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Foffani et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Merica and Fortune, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>The gamma-band (30 -100 Hz) includes the low-gamma (30 -80 Hz) and part of the high-gamma (80 -160 Hz) range <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Canolty et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The

Ͻ400 ms), beta-and low gammaband (30 -60 Hz) power decreases during 400 -600 ms (which were close to the average RT of 580 ms and were most significant in right the inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus), decreases in beta-band power at late latency in the right middle frontal gyrus, and even lower bands of theta and alpha in other regions such as the left fusiform gyrus during 500 -700 ms.</s><s>For the right inferior frontal gyrus, there was also an increase in theta-and alpha-band power before the response.</s><s>The left inferior frontal gyrus source showed a more complex pattern with an increase in late-latency low (Ͻ20 Hz) and high (Ͼ80 Hz) band power.</s></p><p><s>To the right of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, source waveforms from each source are presented for comparison.</s><s>There were small (the N2 component for the early latency) and nonsignificant differences (the P300 for the later 400 -600 ms component) between congruent and incongruent target conditions.</s></p><p><s>We also found theta-and alpha-band power bursts after the button response in the right fusiform gyrus for the spatial cuecongruent target condition, which had an average RT of 500 ms.</s><s>The complex patterns of the executive control effect from the dipole sources of the executive control network may also relate to the shifting of frequency components along the time axis under the incongruent condition for conflict processing.</s><s>Based on these findings, we decided to investigate further by analyzing the response-locked power spectral changes.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the complex pattern of results obtained from the response-locked analysis for the executive control network.</s><s>Similar to the late power decreases found for the target-locked analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), there were broad-band power decreases before the responses made to targets accompanied by incongruent flankers compared with those with congruent flankers (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, conflict resolution column).</s><s>There was also a gamma-band power increase in almost all sources typically after response.</s><s>Consistent with the target-locked analysis, the theta burst after target response can be seen clearly from the right fusiform gyrus dipole source.</s><s>The ACC and left superior frontal gyrus dipole sources showed the beta-band burst and increased gamma power after response.</s></p><p><s>In summary, alerting was most accompanied by a decrease in theta-, alpha-, and beta-band activity after a warning signal (200 -450 ms).</s><s>Orienting was associated with an increase in gammaband activity either after a cue (ϳ200 ms) indicating the target location or when a target requires a shift of attention to the target location.</s><s>For the target-locked analysis, the conflict processing in the executive network involved an early (Ͻ400 ms) increase of a broad-band activity including gamma-band and a late (Ͼ 400 ms) decrease of a broad-band activity including theta-, alpha-, and low gamma-bands.</s><s>For the response-locked analysis of conflict resolution, the decrease of broad-band activity, including theta-, alpha-, and low gamma-before response and theta-, beta-, and gammaband bursts near or after response, were also observed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Each of the three attentional networks appears to have a distinct pattern of synchronized frequency change.</s><s>In the alerting network, the decrease in theta-, alpha-, and beta-band power corresponds to the usual desynchronization of electrical activity after a warning.</s><s>One interpretation of this finding could be that the desynchronization occurs in response to any visual stimulus, and is not specific to alerting.</s><s>However, the abrupt onset of any visual stimulus is known to attract attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yantis and Jonides, 1984)</ref>, therefore we may also interpret the standard alpha suppression effect to be related to attention.</s><s>In this study, the reduction of activity was not just in the alpha band, but was much more broadly distributed in the frequency domain.</s><s>The fact that cued target responses showed attenuated theta-, alpha-, and beta-band power reduction may provide support for the relationship between these frequency domains and the alerting function.</s><s>The across-dipole desynchronization of theta-, alpha-, and beta-bands found in this study may indicate the involvement of thalamocortical circuits, including norepinephrine systems involved in alerting <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Marrocco and Davidson, 1998</ref>).</s><s>The norepinephrine system has been shown to be involved in general preparatory states.</s><s>In our study, the decrease in theta-, alpha-, and beta-band power occurs ϳ200 ms after the warning in all of the cued conditions.</s><s>This result indicates a mechanism such as alerting resulting from information that a target will occur, and suggests a relationship between these frequency bands and the alerting function.</s><s>In addition, it may be useful to consider the distinction between sources and sites of the alerting network.</s><s>The fusiform activity may be the site of origin and not part of the alerting network per se, and may be related to the fact that we just presented a stimulus in the visual modality or modulated by the sources of the alerting network (e.g., the thalamus).</s></p><p><s>Evidence from cellular studies in monkeys indicates that attended targets induce changes in gamma-band activity in the visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fries et
