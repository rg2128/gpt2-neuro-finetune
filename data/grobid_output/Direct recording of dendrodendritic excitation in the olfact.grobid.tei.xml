<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The olfactory bulb (OB) plays a central role in processing olfactory sensory input originating in receptor neurons.</s><s>Through a combination of intrinsic properties and local synaptic circuits, principal cells in the OB generate firing patterns that reflect differential patterns of activity in glomerular input channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Shepherd, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>The primary excitatory drive to each bulb principal neuron [mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs)] arises from a restricted set of sensory receptor neurons that express one odorant receptor subtype.</s><s>Mitral and tufted cells also receive potent inhibitory input that functions to modulate their response to activity in their cognate subgroup of receptor neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(White et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fukunaga et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Through these local connections, the odor-evoked firing pattern of MCs and TCs is shaped to reflect network activity patterns, not just the activity of the one receptor subclass that innervates their apical dendrites <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Guthrie et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Friedrich and Laurent, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Soucy et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>How inhibitory local circuit activity shapes principal cell firing patterns is not known but likely involves input from granule cells (GCs), the most common GABAergic interneuron in the OB, as well as a group of interneurons that resides in the glomerular (input) layer of the OB and that functions to regulate sensory excitation of MCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Shepherd, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Murphy et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Najac et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Granule cells interact with both MCs and TCs through stereotyped reciprocal dendrodendritic (DD) synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rall et al., 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Jahr and Nicoll, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>While multiple studies have reported properties of the GC feedback IPSP onto MCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Isaacson and Strowbridge,

type="bibr">Balu and Strowbridge, 2007)</ref>, much less is known about how GCs are excited through dendrodendritic synapses.</s><s>Only one report quantified GC responses assayed in MC/GC paired recording <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Isaacson, 2001)</ref>, which used voltage-clamp [not action potential (AP) based] stimuli and was focused on the glutamate receptor makeup in GCs.</s><s>Relatively little is known about the physiological response evoked in GCs from mitral/tufted cell spiking or about the short-term plasticity at this pathway.</s></p><p><s>Granule cells receive excitatory input from Ï³65 presynaptic principal OB cells through dendrodendritic synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Greer, 1987)</ref>.</s><s>Differences in unitary response amplitudes and short-term plasticity at these inputs will dramatically affect synaptic integration, leading to pronounced differences in both the frequency and temporal patterning of neuron discharges <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbott and Regehr, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Direct measurements of these properties from paired intracellular recordings are technically challenging because of the sparse connectivity in this brain region <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kato et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is not known whether GCs can be driven to spike in response to relatively few powerful inputs or, instead, only via "mass action" from concerted discharges in many presynaptic MCs and TCs.</s><s>There is indirect evidence, focal extracellular stimulation along the distal dendrites of voltage-clamped GCs <ref type="bibr">(Balu et al., 2007)</ref>, that excitatory dendrodendritic synapses depress.</s><s>However, large-amplitude nondepressing excitatory postsynaptic responses are evoked by glutamate release at axonal terminals formed by the same bulbar principal cells when they synapse onto pyramidal cells in piriform cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hasselmo and Bower, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Franks and Isaacson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stokes and Isaacson, 2010)</ref>, raising the possibility that previous extracellular stimulation studies overestimated short-term depression.</s></p><p><s>Using both whole-cell (WC) intracellular and loose-patch (LP) paired recordings from monosynaptically coupled mitral/ granule cell pairs, we find that single APs evoke small-amplitude, highly variable, unitary EPSPs.</s><s>Dendrodendritic EPSPs showed modest paired pulse depression at physiological firing frequencies but then strongly depress in response to the third and subsequent presynaptic APs.</s><s>Together, the small, variable unitary responses and the short-term plasticity present at dendrodendritic excitatory synapses suggest that near-synchronous activation of a substantial fraction (Ï³50%), of all the presynaptic dendrodendritic excitatory inputs, would be required to trigger spiking in GCs.</s><s>These results suggest that dendrodendritic excitatory inputs likely function to determine a relatively depolarizing "tone" rather than reliably triggering spikes.</s><s>Instead, GC spikes are likely triggered by bursts of activity in piriform cortical neurons that coincide with sensory-evoked periods of dendrodendritic EPSP summation.</s><s>Working together, local bulbar and cortical feedback excitatory pathways may function to generate sparse but highly odor-specific GC discharges that facilitate olfactory discrimination by interrupting sensory-driven excitation of mitral and tufted cells.</s></p></div>

(2) processed each spike within the train to determine whether that MC/TC AP would trigger a GC EPSP, based on the measured release probability at that synapse type; (3) if the spike triggered an EPSP, we introduced an onset latency based on a randomly selected DD EPSP latency (Ï½3 ms) plus an additional latency to represent variable onset of MC discharges.</s><s>This added latency enables us to determine the effects of nonsynchronous MC ensembles (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7D</ref>); (4) for the first AP in an MC/TC response, we randomly selected an EPSP amplitude from a library of 335 previously recorded GC EPSPs (excluding failures) assembled from the seven dual WC paired recordings and scaled the template EPSP waveform to that peak amplitude.</s><s>For subsequent MC/TC APs, the EPSP amplitude selected for the initial EPSP in the train was further scaled by the short-term plasticity at that synapse type using the frequency-composite estimates presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, D and G.</s><s>We continued to use the short-term plasticity recorded for the fourth AP for the fifth and for subsequent MC/TC APs in the train.</s><s>This process was repeated to represent a specified number of presynaptic neurons.</s><s>For example, to simulate the input from five presynaptic neurons, we added scaled and latency-jittered EPSP templates driven by five randomly selected MC spike trains.</s></p><p><s>Once all the requested presynaptic inputs had be combined, we determined whether the resulting membrane potential (V m ) would be expected to trigger at least a spike.</s><s>Since GC APs are typically preceded by a large-amplitude (Ï¾10 mV) slow-ramp-up potential before the apparent threshold crossing (estimated AP threshold, Ïª28.0 Ï® 2.8 mV), we determined the most depolarized stable membrane potential in GCs based on a series of graded current steps (Ïª42.0</s><s>Ï® 2.5 mV; N Ï­ 6 GCs).</s><s>In our computer model, simulated membrane potentials more depolarized than this voltage were assumed to trigger spikes.</s><s>To simulate cortical inputs, we generated short â¥-frequency tonic discharges of APs [5 APs at 40 Hz;
