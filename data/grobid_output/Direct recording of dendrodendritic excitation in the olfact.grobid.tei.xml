<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The olfactory bulb (OB) plays a central role in processing olfactory sensory input originating in receptor neurons.</s><s>Through a combination of intrinsic properties and local synaptic circuits, principal cells in the OB generate firing patterns that reflect differential patterns of activity in glomerular input channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Shepherd, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>The primary excitatory drive to each bulb principal neuron [mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs)] arises from a restricted set of sensory receptor neurons that express one odorant receptor subtype.</s><s>Mitral and tufted cells also receive potent inhibitory input that functions to modulate their response to activity in their cognate subgroup of receptor neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(White et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fukunaga et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Through these local connections, the odor-evoked firing pattern of MCs and TCs is shaped to reflect network activity patterns, not just the activity of the one receptor subclass that innervates their apical dendrites <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Guthrie et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Friedrich and Laurent, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Soucy et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>How inhibitory local circuit activity shapes principal cell firing patterns is not known but likely involves input from granule cells (GCs), the most common GABAergic interneuron in the OB, as well as a group of interneurons that resides in the glomerular (input) layer of the OB and that functions to regulate sensory excitation of MCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Shepherd, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Murphy et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Najac et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Granule cells interact with both MCs and TCs through stereotyped reciprocal dendrodendritic (DD) synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rall et al., 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Jahr and Nicoll, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>While multiple studies have reported properties of the GC feedback IPSP onto MCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Isaacson and Strowbridge,

type="bibr">Balu and Strowbridge, 2007)</ref>, much less is known about how GCs are excited through dendrodendritic synapses.</s><s>Only one report quantified GC responses assayed in MC/GC paired recording <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Isaacson, 2001)</ref>, which used voltage-clamp [not action potential (AP) based] stimuli and was focused on the glutamate receptor makeup in GCs.</s><s>Relatively little is known about the physiological response evoked in GCs from mitral/tufted cell spiking or about the short-term plasticity at this pathway.</s></p><p><s>Granule cells receive excitatory input from ϳ65 presynaptic principal OB cells through dendrodendritic synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Greer, 1987)</ref>.</s><s>Differences in unitary response amplitudes and short-term plasticity at these inputs will dramatically affect synaptic integration, leading to pronounced differences in both the frequency and temporal patterning of neuron discharges <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbott and Regehr, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Direct measurements of these properties from paired intracellular recordings are technically challenging because of the sparse connectivity in this brain region <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kato et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is not known whether GCs can be driven to spike in response to relatively few powerful inputs or, instead, only via "mass action" from concerted discharges in many presynaptic MCs and TCs.</s><s>There is indirect evidence, focal extracellular stimulation along the distal dendrites of voltage-clamped GCs <ref type="bibr">(Balu et al., 2007)</ref>, that excitatory dendrodendritic synapses depress.</s><s>However, large-amplitude nondepressing excitatory postsynaptic responses are evoked by glutamate release at axonal terminals formed by the same bulbar principal cells when they synapse onto pyramidal cells in piriform cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hasselmo and Bower, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Franks and Isaacson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stokes and Isaacson, 2010)</ref>, raising the possibility that previous extracellular stimulation studies overestimated short-term depression.</s></p><p><s>Using both whole-cell (WC) intracellular and loose-patch (LP) paired recordings from monosynaptically coupled mitral/ granule cell pairs, we find that single APs evoke small-amplitude, highly variable, unitary EPSPs.</s><s>Dendrodendritic EPSPs showed modest paired pulse depression at physiological firing frequencies but then strongly depress in response to the third and subsequent presynaptic APs.</s><s>Together, the small, variable unitary responses and the short-term plasticity present at dendrodendritic excitatory synapses suggest that near-synchronous activation of a substantial fraction (ϳ50%), of all the presynaptic dendrodendritic excitatory inputs, would be required to trigger spiking in GCs.</s><s>These results suggest that dendrodendritic excitatory inputs likely function to determine a relatively depolarizing "tone" rather than reliably triggering spikes.</s><s>Instead, GC spikes are likely triggered by bursts of activity in piriform cortical neurons that coincide with sensory-evoked periods of dendrodendritic EPSP summation.</s><s>Working together, local bulbar and cortical feedback excitatory pathways may function to generate sparse but highly odor-specific GC discharges that facilitate olfactory discrimination by interrupting sensory-driven excitation of mitral and tufted cells.</s></p></div>

(2) processed each spike within the train to determine whether that MC/TC AP would trigger a GC EPSP, based on the measured release probability at that synapse type; (3) if the spike triggered an EPSP, we introduced an onset latency based on a randomly selected DD EPSP latency (Ͻ3 ms) plus an additional latency to represent variable onset of MC discharges.</s><s>This added latency enables us to determine the effects of nonsynchronous MC ensembles (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7D</ref>); (4) for the first AP in an MC/TC response, we randomly selected an EPSP amplitude from a library of 335 previously recorded GC EPSPs (excluding failures) assembled from the seven dual WC paired recordings and scaled the template EPSP waveform to that peak amplitude.</s><s>For subsequent MC/TC APs, the EPSP amplitude selected for the initial EPSP in the train was further scaled by the short-term plasticity at that synapse type using the frequency-composite estimates presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, D and G.</s><s>We continued to use the short-term plasticity recorded for the fourth AP for the fifth and for subsequent MC/TC APs in the train.</s><s>This process was repeated to represent a specified number of presynaptic neurons.</s><s>For example, to simulate the input from five presynaptic neurons, we added scaled and latency-jittered EPSP templates driven by five randomly selected MC spike trains.</s></p><p><s>Once all the requested presynaptic inputs had be combined, we determined whether the resulting membrane potential (V m ) would be expected to trigger at least a spike.</s><s>Since GC APs are typically preceded by a large-amplitude (Ͼ10 mV) slow-ramp-up potential before the apparent threshold crossing (estimated AP threshold, Ϫ28.0 Ϯ 2.8 mV), we determined the most depolarized stable membrane potential in GCs based on a series of graded current steps (Ϫ42.0</s><s>Ϯ 2.5 mV; N ϭ 6 GCs).</s><s>In our computer model, simulated membrane potentials more depolarized than this voltage were assumed to trigger spikes.</s><s>To simulate cortical inputs, we generated short ␥-frequency tonic discharges of APs [5 APs at 40 Hz; interval coefficient of variation (CV) ϭ 0.05; onset latency jitter ϭ 5 ms], reflecting the propensity of many piriform cortical cells to discharge in ␥-frequency bursts in response to odor stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Zhan and Luo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miura et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>We provided confidence limits on our estimates of the number of presynaptic inputs required to trigger GC spiking by repeating the model 50 times.</s></p><p><s>Since the modeling approach we used did not incorporate active GC conductances (we simply added EPSP waveforms into an initially constant V m buffer), these simulations did not reflect the expected decrement in EPSP amplitude because EPSP summation depolarized the GC closer to the EPSP reversal potential.</s><s>Including this effect would further reduce the already low effectiveness we find in DD EPSPs to trigger GC APs.</s><s>In some GCs, this effect is often partially offset by the recruitment of additional inward current through NMDA receptors activated at membrane potentials near the threshold.</s><s>We elected not to include this effect, or to model the interaction of subthreshold EPSPs with intrinsic GC currents, because our pilot experiments attempting to dissect these components revealed a large degree of heterogeneity among GCs.</s><s>On average, though, depolarizing the membrane potential from Ϫ70 to Ϫ55 mV slightly decreased the mean DD EPSP amplitude (to 93.8 Ϯ 22.7% of the EPSP amplitude recorded at Ϫ70 mV; N ϭ 4 pairs), suggesting that our simulations may underestimate the actual number of presynaptic MCs/ TCs required to trigger a GC AP through the DD synaptic pathway.</s></p><p><s>Experimental design and statistical analysis.</s><s>Paired recordings were evaluated for potential monosynaptic connections by averaging 15-30 consecutive GC responses to precisely timed MC discharges (typically, 4 spikes at 40 Hz).</s><s>Pairs in which the average GC response showed an EPSP-like waveform that began 1-3 ms after the MC AP onset were considered potentially connected neurons.</s><s>Potential connections were further evaluated by examining individual responses and accepted if we observed at least 10 obvious EPSPs driven by the MC AP within a standard monosynaptic latency window (1-3 ms for the onset of presynaptic AP).</s><s>We never observed potential polysynaptic responses (EPSP-like responses in the average response with latencies Ͼ3 ms) consistent with the absence of extensive recurrent excitatory synapses in the OB.</s><s>Estimates of EPSP amplitude were computed both by manually moving computer cursors in an off-line display program and also by using an automated procedure that calculated the ⌬V m between the 2 ms baseline period before the MC AP and a 0.5 ms window centered at the peak of the average EPSP response.</s><s>A similar automated procedure estimated membrane potential noise by calculating the same ⌬V m measurement at randomly selected time points in the same traces.</s><s>Bootstrap time windows that occurred within 50 ms of a spontaneous EPSP were excluded.</s><s>We report both unitary EPSP amplitudes estimated by manual cursor measurements and the automated bootstrap method (with success indicated by responses more than the mean Ϯ 1 SD of the random ⌬V m measurements) in the text;
