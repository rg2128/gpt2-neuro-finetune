<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>To build and maintain a stable and coherent percept in a noisy and ambiguous world, observers take advantage of past information to anticipate forthcoming sensory input.</s><s>While there is a good deal of behavioral evidence in favor of this predictive account of perception, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms.</s><s>The current study suggests that predictive perception may be implemented rhythmically through alpha-band oscillations.</s></p><p><s>Identifying the ear of origin of a weak tone was strongly biased by previous stimuli, two or even three trials before the current trial.</s><s>Although the immediately past trials had no average serial effect, we observed a strong rhythmic fluctuation in bias (or criterion) at ~9.4 Hz that was critically dependent on stimulus history: oscillations occurred only when a stimulus had been presented to the same ear as the current one, either one or two trials previously.</s></p><p><s>The strong dependency of oscillations on stimulus coherency suggests that they play a fundamental role in the propagation of predictive information.</s><s>That oscillations occurred only for stimuli presented to the same ear as the previous stimuli suggests that stimuli somehow initiate or gate oscillatory processes that last until the next trial, and even the one after.</s><s>These oscillations may be related to the "perceptual echo" suggested by VanRullen and Macdonald <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is far from clear how the oscillations last for so long, up to two trials, ~6-8 seconds.</s></p><p><s>It is of course possible that the stimulus itself sets in train an oscillation that is phase-reset by the onset of the next trial's noise burst, possibly with re-amplification.</s><s>Alternatively, it may be that the stimulus does not actually start an oscillation, but somehow sensitizes or primes the circuitry to oscillate, so that when next noise burst of the next trial arrives the oscillations begin.</s><s>A third possibility is that oscillations are always present, and a stimulus to that ear primes their phase-resetting by the next noise burst: without a phase-reset, the oscillations will not be synchronous with noise onset, and therefore will not be measurable by our behavioral technique.</s><s>At this stage it is impossible to distinguish between the three alternatives: however, the results clearly implicate alpha oscillations in the propagation of information about perceptual history.</s></p><p><s>The behavioral oscillations probably result from rhythmical variation of neuronal sensitivity or response gain.</s><s>But why should oscillations in gain affect criterion rather than sensitivity?</s><s>Both this and our previous <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> study suggest that the oscillations may have opposite starting phase in each ear.</s><s>As sensitivity (d') can be calculated only after combination of hits and false alarms of both ears, the out-of-phase modulations should cancel each other out.</s><s>Indeed, post-hoc tests of congruent trials separated for ear of origin of the signal (Figs.</s><s>5F&amp;G), together with evidence from our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, supports the suggestions that monaural oscillations in sensitivity are in antiphase in each ear.</s><s>On the other hand, combining the counter-phased modulation for criterion (the sum of hits and false alarms, oppositely signed for each ear) will not annul the modulations, but cause them to add together in the binaural measurements.</s><s>On this interpretation modulation of criterion is associated with perceptual changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, rather than with modulation of a decision boundary.</s><s>Overall, our interpretation is consistent with the notion of modulation of neuronal response gain induced by phase-resetting endogenous neuronal rhythms, which results in criterion modulation in our experimental design.</s></p><p><s>We have described the stimulus contingency in terms of ear of origin.</s><s>However, it is important to note that stimuli confined to one ear will be perceived as originating from that side of space.</s><s>It is therefore possible that the interaction between consecutive stimuli may not occur at the peripheral monaural level, but at later representation of space.</s><s>In other words, the oscillation could be between spatial regions, rather than between ears.</s><s>This explanation would be consistent with several studies in vision reporting behavioral oscillations between spatial locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and between spatial objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Although the modulations in visual sensitivity were in the theta band, they show that cyclic alternation of spatial sensitivity could be a general perceptual strategy.</s><s>Further evidence along these lines comes from Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen's <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> demonstration of opposite EEG phase in the two hemispheres of "perceptual echoes", 10 Hz reverberations in response to visual stimulation.</s><s>It seems reasonable to expect similar effects in audition.</s></p><p><s>Why did our experiments reveal no average positive serial dependence on the immediately previous trial (1-back), as is normally observed in studies of serial dependence?</s></p><p><s>There are (at least) two possible, non-mutually exclusive explanations.</s><s>One is that forcedchoice paradigms can lead to sequential response biases, such as alternation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which would tend to cancel out positive serial dependence based on the previous stimulus, but have no average effect for trials two-back.</s><s>The response-based analysis showed a strong negative serial dependency, consistent with response alternation, potentially cancelling perceptual positive serial dependence.</s><s>Another possible reason is that the stimuli may have caused both positive serial dependence and negative adaptation aftereffects.</s><s>Negative aftereffects tend to be shorter lived than assimilative dependencies, and may therefore cancel out only 1-back, not 2-back trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Whatever the reason for the lack of positive serial dependence in the averaged 1-back results, our study shows that oscillations may be a more sensitive signature of memory-based perceptual effects than simply looking at average results.</s><s>Many competing effects could reduce or annul average serial dependence effects, without affecting rhythmic, time-dependent oscillations.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we showed that when discriminating the ear of origin of a brief sinusoidal target within dichotic white noise, decision criteria oscillate at an alpha rhythm, but only when the previous target had been presented to the same ear.</s><s>To account for these findings, we propose that presentation of a target potentiates ear-specific, alpha-rhythm reverberations, that bias perceptual decisions rhythmically, presumably by rhythmic modulation of response gain.</s><s>The exact mechanisms of this process are far from clear, but the results show that alpha oscillations play a major role in propagating expectations and past perceptual history to affect current perception.</s><s>It would be interesting to study these effects further with neurophysiological techniques, such as EEG, MEG or Functional Near Infrared Imaging.</s></p><p><s>software PsychToolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> in conjunction with DataPixx (Vpixx Technologies) in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts).</s><s>Trials were excluded if the response occurred before the target onset or after the noise offset, or if the reaction time (RT) exceeded the 99 % confidence interval of that individuals' RT.</s></p></div>
