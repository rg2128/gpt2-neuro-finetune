10,000 pairs in each experiment, we obtained highly significant results at the population level.</s></p><p><s>Average influence effects could result from strong influence in a small fraction of pairs or weaker influence distributed across the population.</s><s>Removing pairs with the largest positive or negative influence did not qualitatively change the population results (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a-c</ref>).</s><s>Also, influence relationships were not significantly affected by a neuron's baseline activity level or other properties (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d-i</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, the addition of a few spikes to a targeted neuron had a distributed effect across many non-targeted neurons.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuning similarity is inversely related to influence</head><p><s>To test hypotheses of feature amplification and feature competition, we related visual tuning and influence in the same pairs of neurons.</s><s>In blocks without photostimulation, we measured the tuning of neurons to gratings with randomly sampled drift direction, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency.</s><s>To estimate neural tuning in the absence of identical stimulus repeats, we used a Bayesian nonparametric smoothing method, Gaussian Process regression (GP) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>-b, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s><s>This method creates a tuning curve by approximating responses via comparisons to trials with a similar stimulus, assuming that neural responses are a smooth function of stimulus parameters.</s><s>GP smoothing yielded similar tuning results to a conventional model and better predictions of neural activity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>For each pair of neurons, we computed similarity in tuning as a signal correlation, measured as the correlation between single-trial GP predictions of each neuron's visual stimulus response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>).</s><s>We also computed similarity in trial-to-trial variability as a noise correlation, using the correlation between single-trial residuals after subtraction of GP predictions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>).</s><s>A model-free 'trace correlation' was computed as the correlation between the neurons' activity throughout the tuning measurement block (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We used multiple linear regression to determine how distance, signal correlation, and noise correlation metrics related to the influence between neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d</ref>).</s><s>Regression coefficients revealed the sign and magnitude of a metric's relationship to influence, after controlling for the effects of other similarity metrics.</s><s>We used this approach because there were correlations between metrics, such as higher activity correlations at shorter anatomical distances and a positive correlation between signal and noise correlations (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a-b</ref>).</s><s>We included terms for interactions between metrics to consider non-linear effects, such as a changing relationship between signal correlation and influence at different anatomical distances.</s><s>We complemented the regression analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e-f</ref>) by plotting influence as a function of single activity metrics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3g-i</ref>) and comparing these plots to regression-based predictions (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6c-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The regression results confirmed that influence had a center-surround pattern as a function of distance: near pairs had a negative slope, intermediate pairs a positive slope, and distant pairs a slope near zero (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>, left; cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2g</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, influence was positively related to a neuron pair's noise correlation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>, right).</s><s>However, the noise correlationby-distance interaction coefficient was negative, indicating the relationship between influence and noise correlations decayed with anatomical distance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>, right).</s><s>Therefore, there existed a positive relationship between influence and noise correlation for nearby pairs, and little relationship for distant pairs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3g</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that noise correlations for nearby pairs partially reflected local influence, whereas noise correlations over a broad spatial range may reflect shared external inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We then considered the relationship between influence and signal correlation.</s><s>A positive regression coefficient would support feature amplification, whereas a negative coefficient would support feature competition.</s><s>Influence had a significant negative relationship with signal correlation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>, right).</s><s>The signal correlation-by-distance interaction term was close to zero, indicating that this relationship did not vary with anatomical distance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>, right).</s><s>Influence also appeared more negative for higher signal correlation values by direct examination (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3h</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, similarly tuned neurons suppressed each other's activity more than dissimilarly tuned neurons, across all distances examined.</s></p><p><s>To test which tuning features contributed to this relationship, we replaced signal correlation in the influence regression with correlations of individual tuning features.</s><s>Orientation tuning recapitulated the negative relationship with influence, as did temporal frequency, indicating that representations of these features were reshaped by recurrent computation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3f,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>).</s><s>Influence appeared unrelated to tuning similarity for running speed and spatial frequency, despite robust neural tuning to both of these features (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3f</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c-d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Local processing may therefore selectively shape only a subset of features present in its inputs.</s></p><p><s>Multiple factors therefore contributed to influence: (1) a center-surround effect of distance, (2) a positive effect of noise correlation that decayed with distance, and (3) a spatiallyinvariant negative effect of signal correlation, with specificity for distinct stimulus features.</s><s>We verified that these influence patterns were not due to data processing or analysis artifacts by analyzing ΔF/F traces directly (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-e</ref>).</s><s>Because photostimulation likely caused weak activation of neurons near the targeted neuron, including axially displaced neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1f</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f-g</ref>), we tested for effects due to off-target photostimulation.</s><s>We repeated influence regression, but using the average activity similarity between the non-targeted neuron and multiple neurons near the target site.</s><s>We found no significant effects of local activity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7f</ref>).</s><s>Thus, our findings reflect a genuine relationship between an individual photostimulated neuron's characteristics and its influence.</s></p></div>
