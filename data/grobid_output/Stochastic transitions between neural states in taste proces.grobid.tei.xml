(2007)</ref>, our level of modeling is sufficiently realistic that neural spike trains are produced.</s><s>Beyond this, model specification is minimal, however: we do not assume that any particular property of a single neuron is responsible for the observed temporal dynamics.</s><s>The multiple timescales of the system arise from the interaction between network structure and rapid noise fluctuations rather than from any specific property explicitly built into the model.</s><s>Thus, we chose the simplest possible model of a spiking neuron, namely the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tuckwell, 1988)</ref>.</s><s>LIF cells fire at a higher rate with increased excitatory input once a threshold is reached and at a lower rate when inhibitory input is increased; they produce spike trains with a coefficient of variation similar to that of a Poisson process, assuming sufficiently noisy inputs.</s><s>To ensure noisy spike trains, beyond the input explicitly calculated from cells within the network, we add a Poisson barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to represent activity of other connected cells not explicitly included in our network.</s></p><p><s>The basic equation for the LIF neuron describes the temporal variation of membrane potential, V i , of cell i, when receiving total excitatory synaptic conductance input g E S i

resting potential of the cell in the absence of synaptic input and spiking activity), V E is the reversal potential of excitatory synaptic input, and V I is that of inhibitory synaptic input.</s><s>The scales of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance are set by g E and g I , respectively, with maximal conductance of a synapse from neuron j to i given by g E W Ii (if excitatory) or g I W Ii (if inhibitory).</s></p><p><s>Total synaptic inputs S i E and S i I are given by summing over presynaptic cells (over all excitatory cells to calculate S i E and over all

absence of explicitly modeled synaptic inputs, excitatory cells fired at under 3 Hz, whereas inhibitory cells fired at ϳ5 Hz.</s><s>Their specific values are given in the supplemental data (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s></p><p><s>Hidden Markov modeling.</s><s>We used standard Matlab packages for Hidden Markov modeling, using as inputs 10 trials of spike trains of two excitatory cells per pool (10 total) in the taste-processing network and four excitatory cells per pool (8 total) in the decision-making network (these numbers of trials and neurons are similar to those successfully analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jones et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>We binned spike trains on a scale of 2 ms and generated vectors containing the identity of a neuron that spiked in each bin, with a "0" for no spike.</s><s>(For the rare occurrence of a bin containing spikes from more than one cell, neuron identity was chosen randomly from the cells that spiked.)</s><s>We iterated until convergence or up to a maximum of 500 iterations, using the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is guaranteed to approach a local optimum, using eight different random starting models.</s><s>The final model with maximum log likelihood (calculated as the probability of producing the measured spike trains given the particular model) was treated as the optimal characterization of population activity in the network.</s><s>Given the final model, we were able to plot for each trial the probability as a function of time that the ensemble of neuronal activity corresponds to a particular HMM state.</s></p><p><s>For our baseline simulations we allowed six HMM states to be used in the modeling.</s><s>In typical simulations of the taste-processing network, only four states were used in a trial, and, in the decision-making network, only two states were used.</s><s>That is, HMM defined the probability of being in these extra states as 0 throughout trials.</s><s>To test the importance of model parameters, we also ran HMM starting with from 3 to 10 states and with time bins varying from 1 to 25 ms.</s><s>We calculated the overlap of these model outputs with our original model in cases when equivalent states could be observed.</s><s>We defined the overlap, O() in each trial () as a normalized dot product between the probabilities P and PЈ for the original and new HMM by the following calculation:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">O͑͒ ϭ 1 N iϭ1 N n P i n ͑͒ PЈ i n ͑͒ ͱ n P i n ͑͒ P i n ͑͒ ͱ n PЈ i n ͑͒ PЈ i n ͑͒ ,</formula><p><s>where i is the index of the time bin (from 1 to N ) in the original model, and the sum over n is the sum over states matched across models by their order of appearance.</s><s>Thus, PЈ i n () is the probability in a comparison model, being in state n in trial at the time equal to the time of the ith bin in the original model (the actual bin number may be different when comparing models of different bin size).</s><s>From the set of O() across trials, we report the mean and SD in Results.</s><s>Figures of example trials with specific parameters and values for O() are provided in the supplemental data (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s></p><p><s>Performance of decision-making network.</s><s>For each parameter set, we simulated 100 random trials and defined performance as the number of correct minus the number of incorrect responses.</s><s>We defined a response as the average firing rate of one pool exceeding that of the other pool by Ͼ20 Hz and the response as

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stochastic transitions between discrete states</head><p><s>Our model network for taste processing produced a predictable sequence of activity states given a specific set of inputs, with sharp transitions between the states (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 A,</ref><ref type="figure">B,</ref><ref type="figure">D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>).</s><s>Sequences were stable, with all 10 trials of each particular set of inputs producing an identical sequence (see also transition matrices in the supplemental data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>We simulated two types of input corresponding to two different tastes, which produced two different sequences (although with an identical initial state).</s><s>Average state duration was 615 Ϯ 68 ms for taste 1 and 471 Ϯ 50 ms for taste 2, whereas average transition time between states was smaller by more than an order of magnitude (mean of 27 Ϯ 6 ms for taste 1 and mean of 35 Ϯ 4 ms for taste 2).</s></p><p><s>The timing of individual transitions was highly variable across trials, such that an abrupt change in the firing rates of cells apparent on individual trials at a particular time were observed at a different time in the successive trial.</s><s>For example, the average range of the time of second transition within a single set of trials was 600 -894 ms for taste 1 and 636 -1020 ms for taste 2. Thus, much of the sharpness of the reliably observed firing rate changes is lost in the trial-averaged activity, which are by their nature time locked to the stimulus onset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref> ).</s><s>This sharpness is recovered in histograms keyed to state transitions rather than stimulus delivery, as shown by the comparison of these two cases for individual cells in each panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Similar results were observed across a broad region of parameter space used for the HMM.</s><s>Overlaps, O, of probabilities with a standard model that used six states and 2 ms time bins are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>The final column is a control, comparing the original data with trial indices randomly shuffled with the original HMM parameters.</s><s>In some other cases (e.g., using fewer than six states with a time bin of above 20 ms or more than six states with a time bin of Ͻ2 ms), no reliable state sequences were produced.</s><s>Figures showing these comparisons of HMM fits can be found in the supplemental data (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s></p><p><s>Because cells in a network are connected to each other, a significant change in the firing of one group of cells leads to correlated changes in firing rates of other cells as the state sequence progresses.</s><s>Thus, histograms of average firing rates as a function of states in the sequence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 C,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref> ) demonstrate that our interconnected network gives rise to the features of distributed processing apparent in the neural data: (1) individual cells fire spikes in more than one state, (2) firing rates of some cells increase whereas others decrease across state transitions, and (3) each state contains activity of multiple cells at multiple rates.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two modes of decision-making</head><p><s>To assess the computational value of a model with discrete states and sharp, stochastic transitions between them, we analyzed the subpart of our taste-processing network that produces a binary choice, namely "palatable" versus "unpalatable", to produce a behavioral response of "spit" versus "swallow" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 A</ref>).</s><s>In general, the relative strength of inputs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> A, arrows) to the two pools is history and learning dependent, as well as stimulus de-pendent.</s><s>We do not consider the full interplay of past with present stimuli here but assess how differences of input determine the basins of attraction for network activity and how likely the network is to produce one decision or the other.</s><s>We distinguish two modes of operation that can be instantiated within such a decision-making network: a ramping mode produced by deterministic integration of activity and a jumping mode that relies on a stochastic transition from one deterministically stable attractor state to another.</s></p><p><s>Attractor networks that can produce binary choices typically possess three stable states <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brunel and Wang, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wang, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wong and Wang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wong et al., 2007)</ref>: a state with no decision, and two decisive states, one for each of the binary choices, as indicated schematically by the "pseudopotentials" in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, B and C. A pseudopotential is defined to possess a slope proportional to the deterministic rate of change of a variable, such as the firing rate of a group of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Miller and Wang, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Strictly it requires the state of the system to depend only on that one variable, but, in this case, we draw schematic figures to indicate the deterministic tendency for the system to change as a function of the difference in firing rates of the two populations.</s><s>A pure random walk process possesses a flat pseudopotential, because what- ever the rates of cells, they have no tendency to drift in one direction above another.</s><s>Biased random walk models produce pseudopotentials with constant slope downward in the direction of bias.</s><s>However, attractor models have local minima, such that the firing rates return to a stable value after any small change.</s><s>Previous investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brunel and Wang, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wang, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wong and Wang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wong et al., 2007)</ref> of such attractor-based decision-making proposed that stimulus delivery renders the spontaneous activity state (representing no decision) deterministically unstable, so that firing rates elevate, on average more for the state with greater input.</s><s>Once one group is sufficiently active to suppress the other, fluctuations have little effect and one of the two attractors representing a decision is reached.</s><s>The attractors appear as local minima of the pseudopotential in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, the mode in which this network functions can be changed with any one of a number of simple adjustments: if either the total input is weaker or if the cells in the decisionmaking network are less excitable, the spontaneous state can remain stable even in the presence of a stimulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>Small fluctuations do not accumulate, because after small deviations, the system returns to a stable state of low activity with no difference between the rates of cells in the two pools.</s><s>Occasionally, larger fluctuations can cause a significant change in the activity of the network, sufficient to switch the system into a different stable activity state, in which one of the pools is highly active and suppresses the other.</s><s>Thus, the final state of the system after such a fluctuation is qualitatively the same as that of models of decision-making based on deterministic integration, but the dynamics of the change from spontaneous to persistent states is significantly different: in our terminology, a jump rather than a ramp.</s><s>In the following section (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), we use two different networks, one in ramping mode and one in jumping mode, with parameters adjusted so the two networks take similar mean times (1280 Ϯ 434 ms for jumping, 1640 Ϯ 260 ms for ramping) to reach an active state after stimulus onset.</s></p><p><s>HMM analysis of spike trains from eight representative cells selected in equal numbers from each pool reveals the difference in the two modes of operation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Ramping produces slow transitions (153 Ϯ 47 ms) between states and an extra HMM state of intermediate activity between spontaneous and persistent states (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5 A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>However, the jumping mode produces just two stable states with sharp transitions (mean of 19 Ϯ 5 ms) between them, with highly variable timing of those transitions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>) (mean transition time of 1065 Ϯ 556 ms).</s></p><p><s>The advantage of computer simulation is our ability to monitor every single neuron in every trial.</s><s>Thus, we can analyze the fine temporal details of network activity on a trial-by-trial basis, in a manner not possible in a biological network.</s><s>In particular, neurons that have similar responses (typically all 80 excitatory neurons or all 20 inhibitory neurons of a specific population in our simulations) can be binned together, reducing noise, and allowing us to obtain the dynamics of each type of neuron during each trial.</s><s>To reduce measurement noise, the bins we use to calculate mean population activity on a trial-by-trial basis are significantly larger (200 ms) than the 2 ms bins used as input to the HMM analysis.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, A and C, shows the mean activity of the four types of cell: excitatory in solid line, inhibitory in dashed lines, with the

the allocated 2 s of stimulus response.</s><s>Such trials, which we label as "undecided" and count as 1 ⁄2 for a correct trial and 1 ⁄2 for an error trial, disappear if response time is drawn out far beyond 2 s.</s><s>Although noise does lead to variability across trials in neural responses in the ramping mode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6 B</ref>), the latency variability is significantly greater in jumping mode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6 D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To quantify these differences in transition speeds, we defined the onset time of a firing rate change as the point at which mean population activity passed 5 Hz (a rate never produced in the spontaneous state) and calculated how long it took increasing firing rates to reach an arbitrary threshold of 40 Hz.</s><s>In ramping mode, firing rate changes commenced at 240 Ϯ 84 ms (mean Ϯ  Note that the transitions in jumping mode of our model were much slower than transition times found by HMM analysis of the same data for two reasons.</s><s>First, population activity is binned at 200 ms, limiting our ability to resolve rate of change, whereas HMM analysis can use 2 ms bins.</s><s>Second, in our sparse random networks, neurons within a population differ in their inputs and excitability, so the times for the average rate of 80 cells to increase is much longer than the times for the rate of individual cells to change.</s></p><p><s>To further analyze the behavior of our model network, we switch between modes of decision-making by adjusting, in a single network, the stability of the spontaneous state of activity of the two excitatory populations when an input is present.</s><s>In the jumping mode, the spontaneous state is stable, either because both populations receive relatively little total input (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>) or because we globally increase the leak conductance of all cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>) to represent a constant inhibitory drive.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref> shows the results of a speed-accuracy tradeoff within the jumping mode.</s><s>As we enhance the stability of the spontaneous state (i.e., reducing the total applied current and moving along the x-axis to the left), the probability increases that the decision-making network response will follow input bias.</s><s>Thus, performance improves with increased stability of the spontaneous state.</s><s>However, in the case of highest stability and best performance, the time taken to produce a decision was frequently Ͼ10 s, far longer than of behavioral relevance for taste processing.</s><s>That is, in the jumping mode, any increase in performance comes at the cost of increased decision-making time (see Analyses in the supplemental data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>In the ramping mode at larger applied currents, meanwhile, choice probability is approximately constant, such that there is no benefit of increasing integration time.</s></p><p><s>We define performance as the difference between percentage of "correct" trials and "incorrect" trials, so that chance response corresponds to zero performance.</s><s>Our definition of performance penalizes those undecided trials in the jumping mode when no transition away from spontaneous activity was made during stimulus presentation, by assuming no better than chance re-sponses on such trials, thus neglecting any information from the inputs that could affect any forced response.</s><s>Such undecided trials, when all cells remained at or near spontaneous activity levels, never occur in the ramping mode: in all ramping trials, at least one population reached activity at least 20 Hz higher than the other for two consecutive 200 ms time bins (our criterion to select the "winning" population) so a binary response could be determined even if the attractor state was not yet reached.</s></p><p><s>When we restricted the duration of stimulus processing to 2 s [a typical time for a taste to remain on the tongue before swallowing <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Travers and Norgren, 1986)</ref>], performance was best (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>) when the spontaneous activity is stabilized by an increase of inhibitory current to all excitatory cells in the network.</s><s>The peak in performance occurs, furthermore, when this inhibitory current drives the network into the jumping mode of decisionmaking.</s><s>At even higher levels of inhibition, the network more frequently remains in the spontaneous state, producing no decision within the stimulus duration of 2 s, and thus overall performance declines.</s><s>Such a peak in performance, in which the timescale for a noise-dependent state transition approaches but does not exceed the timescale of the input (in our case the duration of the input), is an indication that our system undergoes stochastic resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McDonnell and Abbott, 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Addition of noise to the stimulus, produced when inputs are simulated as Poisson spike trains rather than as constant currents, has little effect in the ramping mode, because the difference in the two inputs producing a bias for deterministic integration is of a far greater magnitude than the fluctuations in the inputs.</s><s>Such inclusion of input noise allows the network to operate farther into the region of stochastic transitions in its jumping mode, however, specifically because increased noise increases the likelihood of a state transition before 2 s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, although stimulus noise inevitably reduces the reliability of the difference between two stimuli, it paradoxically leads to better performance in the jumping mode by accelerating the decisionmaking process.</s></p><p><s>The benefit of the jumping mode for decision-making-an improved ability to produce a binary output that follows a small bias-arises because the decision-making network has its own internal noise.</s><s>To explore the extent of the advantage of the jumping mode over the ramping mode, we can reduce the effect of internal noise simply by increasing the number of neurons in each network pool (and simultaneously scaling down individual synaptic strengths); this reduces noise because the noise is injected into each neuron independently.</s><s>Performance of the jumping mode peaks at a level of 50 independent cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>): increasing noise heightens the probability of errors, whereas reducing noise lessens the ability of the network to respond in the stimulus window.</s><s>However, the advantage over the ramping mode remains across a realistic range of levels of network noise [up to a noise level corresponding to 100 independent neurons, beyond which in vivo correlations render any additional averaging out of noise impossible <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Zohary et al., 1994)</ref>].</s><s>Ultimately, deterministic integration in the ramping mode performs better only under conditions in which internal noise levels are reduced further (as they can be in computer simulations, in contrast to in vivo): a jumping network performing stochastic transitions under low-noise conditions ultimately reaches zero performance, because no transitions occur in the absence of noise, whereas such noise is only a detriment to the performance of a ramping network performing deterministic integration.</s></p><p><s>To explore the generality of these findings, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> we present the results of parameter exploration in which, compared with Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>, the signal is stronger, because the input rates are either doubled (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 A-C</ref>) or quintupled (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 D-F</ref> ).</s><s>The network is slightly altered from that of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> in an attempt to optimize the ramping mode; we reduced the recurrent excitation within a pool to reduce the speed of deterministic transitions.</s><s>In all figures, the transition from ramping to jumping arises as we increase leak conductance to stabilize the spontaneous state; the stabilization requires higher leak conductance with greater external inputs.</s><s>The transition is obtained by monitoring the SD of transition times as the network size is increased to reduce internal noise.</s><s>In the ramping mode, the reduction of noise reduces SD of transition times, but in the jumping mode the opposite occurs (i.e., because of the increase in mean transition time, a reduction in noise increases absolute temporal variability).</s></p><p><s>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> A-C, we see for all three population sizes (50, 100, and 200) and for all three stimulus durations (1, 2, and 5 s) that optimal performance occurs with sufficient leak conductance that the system operates in jumping mode.</s><s>However, a dramatic drop off in performance occurs when the leak conductance is increased beyond that needed for optimal performance, because the response time rises extremely rapidly (supplemental data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) with additional stabilization of the spontaneous state.</s><s>A fivefold increase of the inputs from our base conditions produces a different story (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 D-F</ref> ).</s><s>In all cases but one, optimal performance arises either in the ramping mode or on the boundary of ramping and jumping modes.</s><s>Only in the system with highest internal noise (50 cells with independent noise, per group) and longest stimulus duration (5 s) is the jumping mode still optimal.</s><s>Thus, in general, we find that a strong signal (here an average of an extra 50 spikes/s through 5 nS AMPA receptor-mediated synapses to each excitatory cell of the biased population) favors the deterministic ramping mode, whereas high internal noise (equivalent to 100 or fewer cells with independent Poisson-like firing per population) combined with a long allowed response time favors the jumping mode.</s></p><p><s>One factor that can have a deleterious effect on the response is variability in the network preceding stimulus onset.</s><s>In fact, even if the spontaneous state is deterministically stable, in principle, spontaneous transitions can produce a random response <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Miller and Wang, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> we assess, using a firing rate model and nullcline analysis, how variation in starting conditions can produce differing responses once the stimulus is present.</s><s>The nullclines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, S-shaped curves) indicate the values at which the rate of change of one variable is 0 given a fixed value of a second variable.</s><s>In this case, the two variables are the synaptic outputs of the two excitatory populations, which are monotonic functions of the firing rate of each population.</s><s>The green curve shows where dS2/dt ϭ 0 at fixed S1, and the red curve shows where dS1/dt ϭ 0 at fixed S2.</s><s>The S-shape to each curve indicates that one population is bistable (can have both a stable low firing rate and a stable high firing rate) for a small range of activity of the other population.</s><s>Intersections of the two nullclines indicate fixed points of the system, which we mark by filled circles for stable states and open circles for unstable states.</s></p><p><s>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9A-C</ref>, we increase the input strengths multiplicatively, thus increasing the signal, to switch from jumping mode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9A</ref>) to a slow ramping mode via 25% increase of inputs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9B</ref>) and a strongly ramping mode with fivefold increase of inputs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9C</ref>).</s><s>The 10% bias of inputs favors the fixed point (filled circle) with high S2 and low S1.</s><s>In the absence of noise, all trajectories (blue) in the jumping mode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9A</ref>) terminate in the symmetric state with low S1 and low S2, whereas in the deterministic ramping mode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9B</ref>), 10 of 11 trajectories (orange) terminate in the state with high S2 (near perfect performance).</s><s>However, with even stronger signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9C</ref>), a large number of errors occur, because many initial conditions produce a trajectory (in magenta) that terminates with large S1 and low S2 (only 8 of 13 trajectories follow the input bias).</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9D</ref>-F shows the same nullclines as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9A</ref>-C, with the same set of initial conditions but with a small amount of noise added to the trajectories.</s><s>The noise enables the jumping mode to produce responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9D</ref>) so that 10 trajectories terminate at high S2 versus one at high S1 (and 2 at low S1, low S2).</s><s>The noise produces more errors in the slow ramping mode so that eight trajectories terminate at high S2 and 5 at high S1, whereas trajectories in the strong, fast ramping mode are little affected by the additional noise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9F</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>The benefit of a high threshold in the jumping mode for stochastic decision-making can be appreciated by considering two Gaussian distributions of instantaneous input current, with a difference in means, D, and SDs, .</s><s>Rather than integrating the instantaneous current over time to distinguish the two distributions, one could set a threshold current, T, and ask the following: what is the probability that one distribution of inputs might produce an instantaneous current above that threshold compared with the other distribution?</s><s>That is, we assume that a superthreshold instantaneous current is sufficient to cause a jump to one of the two decision states.</s><s>Measuring T with respect to the mean current of the two distributions, we thus compare the ratio of Ύ TϩD/2 ϱ exp ͩ Ϫ x 2 2 2ͪ dx for the distribution with lower mean to Ύ TϪD/2 ϱ exp ͩ Ϫ x 2 2 2ͪ dx for the distribution with larger mean.</s><s>The resulting ratio of complementary error functions increases with threshold, T, asymptotically reaching exp ͩ TD 2 ͪ for large T (see Analysis 1 in the supplemental data, available at www.jneurosci.</s><s>org as supplemental material).</s><s>Thus, the greater the threshold, the more likely an instantaneous current from the distribution with greater mean is observed above threshold before a current from the distribution with lower mean.</s><s>A similar result is found via analysis of the system as barrier hopping in an asymmetric potential in which an increase in threshold corresponds to a deepening of the initial potential well (see Analysis 2 in supplemental data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>In summary, a small increase in the stability of the initial state beyond its optimum can easily lead to a network with prohibitively high response times.</s><s>However, maintaining stability of the initial state on stimulus onset has clear advantages (Fig. <ref
