Waterhouse, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>It has dense projections into most of cortex, and it has both afferent and efferent connections with areas that have theoretical roles for attention and working memory (e.g., PFC).</s><s>Historically, it has been argued that the LC has a general role in promoting wakefulness, alertness, and arousal, but more recently is has been shown that the LC has more specific functional connections (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berridge and Waterhouse (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Samuels and Szabadi (2008)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Szabadi (2013)</ref> for reviews).</s></p><p><s>Aston-Jones and Cohen (2005)'s influential Adaptive Gain Theory of the LC-NE system argues for a rather specific role of the LC in regulating attention.</s><s>Aston-Jones and Cohen note that the LC exhibits two modes of firing.</s><s>The first is a slow, rhythmic firing (1-3 Hz) that presumably regulates a level of tonic arousal in the organism.</s><s>The second is a rapid, phasic burst of firing in response to the perception of a goal-relevant stimulus in the environment.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, there is an interdependence between these two aspects of activity.</s><s>When tonic firing is low, the organism is in a hypoaroused, drowsy state, and the system does not demonstrate marked phasic firing to nearly any stimulus.</s><s>At an intermediate level of tonic firing, phasic firing is highest and most selective.</s><s>Thus, during goal-directed behavior, it is often optimal for the organism to be in this mode, which Aston-Jones and Cohen call the "exploitative" mode.</s><s>The organism selectively processes relevant stimuli in order to achieve some goal (e.g., detect prey, avoid predators, earn rewards).</s><s>At even higher levels of tonic activity, the organism is in a hyperaroused, overactive state.</s><s>The system responds to stimuli rather indiscriminately.</s><s>In some cases, this can be advantageous.</s><s>Aston-Jones and Cohen refer to this mode as "explorative".</s><s>It can allow the organism to seek new environments and possibilities for rewards.</s><s>However, when there is a specific goal, hyperarousal can be harmful.</s><s>Thus, there is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, and the system must adapt to the situation in order to match tonic activity with the environmental and situational demands.</s></p><p><s>Aston-Jones and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cohen (2005)</ref> argue that the functional consequence of phasic firing of the LC is to release NE into the cortical regions responsible for the goal-relevant computation.</s><s>NE has a gain-modulating role on target cortical neurons.</s><s>It enhances firing among neurons that code for goal-relevant stimuli and inhibits firing among neurons that code for irrelevant stimuli, thus increasing the signal-tonoise ratio.</s><s>So in a way, the LC-NE system directs attention and target cortical regions implement it.</s></p><p><s>The LC-NE account of individual differences in WMC draws upon many of the assumptions and theoretical mechanisms proposed by Aston-Jones and Cohen.</s><s>Additionally, it draws upon work on large-scale brain networks, specifically the fronto-parietal control network (FPN), the salience network (SN), and the default-mode network (DMN).</s><s>As the name suggests, the FPN is a collection of cortical areas that are particularly active during a wide variety of cognitively demanding tasks that require maintenance of task goals in the presence of interference and distraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cohen, Aston-Jones, &amp;

Unsworth, 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Again, they did not have sufficient power to examine individual differences in each individual experiment.</s><s>But combining data across experiments, they examined correlations among k, pretrial pupil diameter, and phasic pupillary responses.</s><s>Highk participants exhibited less variability in pretrial pupil diameter, greater overall phasic pupillary responses, and less variability in phasic pupillary responses.</s><s>Mean pretrial pupil diameter did not correlate with k.</s><s>In a fourth study, participants completed a battery of complex span working memory and attention control tasks during a single laboratory session <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Unsworth &amp; Robison, 2017b)</ref>.</s><s>They measured pupil diameter while participants completed the attention control tasks.</s><s>Using confirmatory factor analysis, they derived latent variables for WMC, attention control, average tonic arousal, variability in tonic arousal, average phasic responses, and variability in phasic responses.</s><s>WMC positively correlated with attention control and negatively correlated with attentional lapses, average pretrial pupil diameter, and variability in pretrial pupil diameter.</s><s>Further, WMC negatively correlated with variability in phasic pupillary responses (but not average phasic responses).</s></p><p><s>Other researchers have also investigated the link between pupil measures and WMC.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Heitz, Schrock, Payne, and Engle (2008)</ref> measured pupil diameter for highand low-WMC participants.</s><s>The high-WMC participants (upper quartile of distribution) had larger pre-experimental pupil diameters and higher baseline pupil diameter across trials than low-WMC participants (lower quartile of distribution).</s><s>Even after an incentivization manipulation, low-WMC participants showed smaller pupil diameters than their high-WMC counterparts.</s><s>In a recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tsukahara, Harrison, and Engle (2016)</ref> examined relationships between baseline (pre-experimental and pretrial) pupil diameter and WMC.</s><s>Across several experiments, Tsukahara et al. observed significant differences between highand low-WMC individuals, as well as people who differed in fluid intelligence, in pupil diameter.</s><s>They interpreted their findings to indicate that people vary in cognitive ability because of differences in the functional organization of the resting-state brain arising from the neuromodulatory role of the LC-NE system.</s><s>Specifically, they argue that a disruption of the functional connectivity between the LC, the DMN, and FPN is one cause of poor cognitive performance during situations that require an external allocation of attention (e.g., WMC and fluid intelligence tasks).</s><s>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tsukahara et al. (2016)</ref> do not make this specific claim, this finding would be consistent with people low in cognitive ability being relatively hypoaroused (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Heitz et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Another possibility is that low-WMC individuals tend to be hyperaroused.</s><s>Via this explanation, low-WMC individuals' higher arousal leads to lapses of attention, and their cognitive performance suffers as a consequence.</s><s>If this is the case, we should observe a negative correlation between WMC and pretrial pupil diameter.</s><s>In their latent variable analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Unsworth and Robison (2017b)</ref> observed a negative correlation between mean baseline pupil diameter and WMC.</s><s>So there is some evidence for this account.</s><s>Finally, the LC-NE account of WMC discussed above <ref type="bibr">(Unsworth &amp; Robison, 2017a)</ref> argues that dysregulation of arousal is the major factor linking LC-NE system functioning to cognitive ability.</s><s>The hypoarousal and hyperarousal accounts are not necessarily mutually exclusive with the dysregulation account.</s><s>That is, it is possible that low-WMC individuals tend to be hypoaroused (or hyperaroused) and experience more volatility in arousal.</s><s>Using structural equation modeling, we will be able to test for these possibilities.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the predictions that each plausible mechanism makes for the present study, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a graphical depiction of the hypotheses.</s></p></div>

Engle, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>We should note that it is possible that this is indeed a source of variation.</s><s>While we posit a different mechanismarousal dysregulation via differential LC-NE functioningthese mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.</s><s>We cannot rule out that individuals who experience more variability in arousal do not also have relatively weaker DLPFC functioning.</s><s>It could also be the case that some people have relatively low WMC because of poor arousal regulation, whereas others have low WMC because of poor DLPFC functioning.</s><s>With the present data, we cannot specifically address the DLPFC theory.</s><s>But because we know there are physiological links between pupil diameter and LC-NE functioning, we can be relatively certain that the inter-and intraindividual variability in pupillary measures indexes, to a reasonable extent, differential activity of the LC-NE system.</s><s>It is also the case that NE is not the only neuromodulator that affects cognition.</s><s>Indeed, other systems likely work in concert with the LC-NE system (e.g., the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems) to give rise to the complex set of computations required in any situation that places demands on working memory and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cools &amp;
