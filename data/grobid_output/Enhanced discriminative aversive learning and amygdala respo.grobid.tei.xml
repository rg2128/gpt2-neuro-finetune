and since wild-type (WT) animals typically display high levels of fear-related behavior ("freezing") in such paradigms, it is difficult to detect further increases.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, 5-HTTOE mice exhibit impaired fear learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, 5-HTTOE mice exhibit reduced amygdala tissue oxygen (T O2 ) responses to aversive cues as measured by voltammetry, as well as reduced cueevoked theta oscillations in the amygdala local field potential (LFP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Voltammetric T O2 measurements are considered a hemodynamic parameter that reflects ongoing neuronal activity, analogous to the BOLD signal in fMRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, theta oscillations in the amygdala are thought to be a neurophysiological substrate for the acquisition of fearful memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To clarify the impact of 5-HTT loss on emotional learning, the present study investigated conditioned aversive learning and amygdala activity in 5-HTTKO mice using a discriminative fear learning paradigm rather than the "single-cue" fear paradigm used in previous investigations of 5-HTTKO rodents.</s><s>Mice were trained to discriminate between two distinct auditory stimuli, one that was paired with foot-shock (CS+) and another that was never paired with foot-shock (CS-).</s><s>In a subset of mice, hemodynamic responses and LFPs were simultaneously recorded from the amygdala during different stages of fear learning.</s><s>An additional experiment tested the effect of acute pharmacological 5-HTT blockade on aversive learning in WT mice because of reports that the anxiety phenotype of 5-HTTKO mice is of developmental origin rather than an on-going loss of 5-HTT function <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Experiment 1 (study of 5-HTTKO mice) used 31 WT mice (15 males and 16 females) and 29 5-HTTKO mice (15 males and 14 females).</s><s>Mice were generated as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and backcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background for at least eight generations.</s><s>Experiment 2 (study of 5-HTT blockade) used 96 female C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Laboratories, Kent, UK).</s><s>Mice were 4-10 months (5-HTTKO and WT) or ~2 months old (C57BL/6J) at the start of testing.</s><s>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) under project licenses PPL 30/2561 and 30/3068, and were approved by local ethical review for the University of Oxford.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgery</head><p><s>For Experiment 1, a subset of mice (WT 8 females and 6 males: 5-HTTKO 7 females and 7 males) were stereotaxically implanted (under isoflurane anesthesia) with electrodes into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to record T O2 and LFPs.</s><s>Co-ordinates were -1.35 mm anterior/ posterior, ¬±3.15 mm medial/lateral and -5.00 mm dorsal/ ventral, relative to bregma (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p></div>
