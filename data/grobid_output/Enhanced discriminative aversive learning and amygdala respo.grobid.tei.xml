and since wild-type (WT) animals typically display high levels of fear-related behavior ("freezing") in such paradigms, it is difficult to detect further increases.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, 5-HTTOE mice exhibit impaired fear learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, 5-HTTOE mice exhibit reduced amygdala tissue oxygen (T O2 ) responses to aversive cues as measured by voltammetry, as well as reduced cueevoked theta oscillations in the amygdala local field potential (LFP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Voltammetric T O2 measurements are considered a hemodynamic parameter that reflects ongoing neuronal activity, analogous to the BOLD signal in fMRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, theta oscillations in the amygdala are thought to be a neurophysiological substrate for the acquisition of fearful memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To clarify the impact of 5-HTT loss on emotional learning, the present study investigated conditioned aversive learning and amygdala activity in 5-HTTKO mice using a discriminative fear learning paradigm rather than the "single-cue" fear paradigm used in previous investigations of 5-HTTKO rodents.</s><s>Mice were trained to discriminate between two distinct auditory stimuli, one that was paired with foot-shock (CS+) and another that was never paired with foot-shock (CS-).</s><s>In a subset of mice, hemodynamic responses and LFPs were simultaneously recorded from the amygdala during different stages of fear learning.</s><s>An additional experiment tested the effect of acute pharmacological 5-HTT blockade on aversive learning in WT mice because of reports that the anxiety phenotype of 5-HTTKO mice is of developmental origin rather than an on-going loss of 5-HTT function <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Experiment 1 (study of 5-HTTKO mice) used 31 WT mice (15 males and 16 females) and 29 5-HTTKO mice (15 males and 14 females).</s><s>Mice were generated as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and backcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background for at least eight generations.</s><s>Experiment 2 (study of 5-HTT blockade) used 96 female C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Laboratories, Kent, UK).</s><s>Mice were 4-10 months (5-HTTKO and WT) or ~2 months old (C57BL/6J) at the start of testing.</s><s>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) under project licenses PPL 30/2561 and 30/3068, and were approved by local ethical review for the University of Oxford.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgery</head><p><s>For Experiment 1, a subset of mice (WT 8 females and 6 males: 5-HTTKO 7 females and 7 males) were stereotaxically implanted (under isoflurane anesthesia) with electrodes into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to record T O2 and LFPs.</s><s>Co-ordinates were -1.35 mm anterior/ posterior, ±3.15 mm medial/lateral and -5.00 mm dorsal/ ventral, relative to bregma (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Amygdala T O2 and LFP recordings</head><p><s>Signals for T O2 were measured using constant potential amperometry, as described in detail previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>A constant potential (-650 mV relative to a reference electrode) was applied to the electrode, which results in the electrochemical reduction of O 2 on the electrode surface such that local changes in O 2 concentration produce directly proportional changes in the measured Faradaic current.</s><s>LFPs were recorded using a differential amplifier (DP-301, Warner Instruments, CT, USA) and sampled continuously at 4 kHz.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fear conditioning</head><p><s>Fear conditioning was conducted in one of two operant chambers (ENV-307A, Med Associates Inc., IN, USA), each with distinct visual and olfactory cues.</s><s>Mice (total of 60 including 28 with implanted BLA electrodes) underwent a pre-exposure day, three training days (T1, T2, and T3), and a fear memory recall day (FMR; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Training was performed in one context (e.g., context A) and recall/ extinction was performed in a different context (e.g., context B if trained in context A).</s><s>Contexts were counterbalanced across mice.</s></p><p><s>Mice were trained to discriminate between two distinct auditory cues (tone and white noise), with one conditioned stimulus (e.g., CS+ = tone) always paired with foot-shock during the training sessions and the other never paired with shock (e.g., CS-= white noise).</s><s>Allocation of tone and white noise to the CS+/CS-was fully counterbalanced across mice.</s><s>During each session, mice were presented with 10 auditory cues (5 × 2900 Hz tone, 5 × white noise; all 72 dB and 30-s duration) in a pseudorandomly interleaved order with a mean inter-cue interval of 80 s (range 60-100 s).</s><s>On training days, each of the five CS+ trials co-terminated with mild foot-shock (0.3 mA, 0.5 s; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>No shocks were given during the preexposure or recall sessions.</s></p></div>
