<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Participants.</s><s>Sixteen participants (aged 19 -33 years, 8 females, all right-handed) gave informed consent to take part in the experiment.</s><s>Visual acuity was normal or corrected to normal.</s><s>All experimental methods had ethical approval from the Central University Research Ethics Committee of the University of Oxford.</s></p><p><s>Apparatus.</s><s>The stimuli were created on MATLAB v.7.10 (The MathWorks) and presented using the Psychtoolbox v.3.0 package for MATLAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brainard, 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Images were displayed on a 21 inch CRT (CTX ultra screen) with a spatial resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels and a vertical refresh rate of 60 Hz, placed 100 cm in front of the participant.</s><s>A chin rest was used to maintain a constant viewing distance and head position.</s><s>Responses were collected via a response box <ref type="bibr">(DirectIN High SpeedButton, Empirisoft)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Stimuli and task.</s><s>The task was based on a previous behavioral study <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Rohenkohl et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Each trial consisted of a stream of 140 foveally presented stimuli (14 targets and 126 standards) with a duration of 50 ms each (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>All stimuli were circular patches (diameter: 4 degrees of visual angle).</s><s>The standards consisted of Gaussian noise patches, while targets contained Gabor patches embedded within the Gaussian noise.</s><s>The Gabor patches were tilted at Ϯ45 degrees, and their spatial frequency was fixed at 2 cycles per degree of visual angle.</s></p><p><s>The Gaussian noise patches were created by smoothing a pixel-bypixel luminance Gaussian noise patch with a two-dimensional Gaussian smoothing kernel, so that their spatial frequency characteristics closely matched those of the Gabor patches <ref type="bibr">(Wyart et al., 2012a)</ref>.</s><s>Both the smoothing dimension (0.083 degree of visual angle) and the root-meansquare contrast of the noise (10%) were fixed across participants and stimuli.</s><s>Targets were inserted within the stimulus stream in a pseudorandomized order, ensuring a minimum of five and maximum of 14 standards between each target.</s><s>Since a large number of targets were presented with a contrast lower than the threshold, isoluminant circles (pink and blue) were positioned around the patches to help the participants dis- criminate between targets and standard stimuli.</s><s>This procedure also prevented participants from responding to standards, and thereby reduced the numbers of false alarms.</s></p><p><s>Temporal expectation was manipulated by varying the regularity of the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) between successive events in a trial.</s><s>In regular trials, SOA was fixed at 400 ms, allowing participants to use the temporal regularity of the stimulation to reduce the uncertainty about when stimuli could be presented.</s><s>In irregular trials, the SOAs were drawn randomly from 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ms.</s><s>As a result of the jittering, irregular trials had an arrhythmic beat, preventing focused temporal expectations about stimulus appearance.</s><s>Importantly, the intervals preceding and succeeding each target were the same in the regular and irregular trials (400 ms).</s><s>This control was introduced to avoid any possible confound related to foreperiod or masking effects caused by the proximity of the standards surrounding the target.</s></p><p><s>Procedures.</s><s>Each participant underwent a calibration session before the experiment using an adaptive psychophysical staircase procedure to estimate the threshold contrast for perceiving the Gabor gratings within the noise patches.</s><s>Task difficulty was adjusted for each participant by titrating the contrast of the Gabor patch for which orientation discrimination was performed at 75% accuracy.</s><s>Seven levels of contrast were chosen for target presentation, based on each subject's threshold values.</s><s>These values ranged from Ϫ0.3 to ϩ0.3 (in steps of 0.1) on a logarithmic scale, with 0 being the measured threshold during the psychophysical staircase procedure.</s><s>The calibration was performed on 12 irregular trials.</s><s>Therefore, any enhancement in contrast sensitivity could not be explained merely by learning effects.</s></p><p><s>After the calibration session, participants performed 50 trials (25 regular and 25 irregular).</s><s>Regular and irregular trials were presented in a randomized order.</s><s>Participants were instructed to respond to the orientation of each target with their left or right index finger according to the target orientation.</s><s>Since the targets were also identified by the color of the placeholder, participants were prompted to respond to targets even at contrast levels below their threshold level.</s><s>The experimental session lasted ϳ1 h.</s><s>Each trial contained 14 targets; altogether each participant was presented with a total of 700 targets (50 at each contrast level within each of the regular and irregular conditions).</s></p><p><s>Psychometric and diffusion model fitting.</s><s>The psychometric data from each participant and condition were fitted with sigmoidal Weibull functions, each defined by three parameters: a threshold ␣, a slope ␤, and lapse-rate ␥ as implemented in Palamedes toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Prins and Kingdom, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Guess rates were fixed at 0.5 (i.e., at chance level) across subjects and conditions, and the three parameters were fitted separately for each subject and condition (regular or irregular).</s><s>Threshold was taken as the predicted contrast level (expressed in logarithmic units) corresponding to an accuracy of 75%.</s><s>Goodness of fit for each participant was tested comparing predicted and observed accuracy (mean r 2 ϭ 0.88, lowest ϭ 0.70).</s></p><p><s>The diffusion model predicts that the psychometric function for accuracy P(x) and the chronometric function for the mean response time t(x) are functions of stimulus strength x according to the following two equations:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P͑ x͒ ϭ 1 1 ϩ exp͑Ϫ2AKx͒ t͑ x͒ ϭ A kx tanh͑k A x͒ ϩ tR,</formula><p><s>where k corresponds to the normalized accumulation rate, A to the normalized decision bound, and t R to the residual time constant.</s><s>Stimulus strength x relates to signal contrast following a power law whose exponent-which controls the overall slope of both psychometric and chronometric functions as a function of signal contrast-was determined empirically for each subject by maximum-likelihood estimation and remained fixed across conditions.</s><s>Goodness of fit for each participant was tested comparing predicted and observed values (mean r 2 ϭ 0.92, lowest ϭ 0.86).</s></p><p><s>EEG recording and preprocessing.</s><s>The EEG was acquired continuously from 35 Ag/AgCl electrodes at 1000 Hz referenced to the right mastoid site (AFZ ground; 300 Hz low-pass filter).</s><s>The electrodes were positioned according to the 10-05 International system (AEEGS, 1991) and recorded using NuAmp amplifiers (Neuroscan, El Paso, TX).</s><s>Electrode impedances were kept below 5 k⍀.</s><s>The montage included seven midline sites (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz, POz, and OZ) and 14 sites over each hemisphere (FP1/FP2, F1/F2, F3/F4, FC1/FC2, FC3/FC4, C1/C2, C3/C4, CP1/ CP2, CP3/CP4, P1/P2, P3/P4, PO3/PO4, PO7/PO8, and O1/O2).</s><s>Six additional electrodes were used as ground and reference sites and for recording the EOG.</s><s>EOG electrodes were placed to the side of each eye (horizontal EOG) and above and below the left eye (vertical EOG), and bipolar signals were subsequently derived by computing the difference between these electrodes.</s></p><p><s>EEG preprocessing was performed using Neuroscan version 4.3 and SPM8 toolbox for MATLAB.</s><s>Continuous EEG was re-referenced to the algebraic average of the right and left mastoids.</s><s>For the parametric regressions (see below), the data were filtered offline with a 40 Hz low-pass filter (24 db/octave) and epoched from Ϫ500 ms to 800 ms relative to target onsets.</s><s>Epochs containing excessive noise or drift (Ϯ100 V at any electrode) or eye artifacts (blinks or saccades) were rejected.</s><s>Blinks and saccades were identified as large deflections (Ϯ50 V) in the horizontal or vertical EOG electrodes, and subsequently checked by visual inspection.</s><s>The number of trials rejected for each subject because of blinks or eye movements was small in both conditions (average across subjects of 9% of trials, maximum of 19%).</s><s>Importantly, the number of trials excluded in each condition did not differ significantly (t (15) ϭ 0.25, p Ͼ 0.80).</s></p><p><s>Time-frequency analyses were performed on the unfiltered data using the SPM8 and Fieldtrip toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Oostenveld et al., 2011)</ref> for MATLAB.</s><s>To avoid edge effects at low frequencies, longer epochs from Ϫ2000 ms to 2000 ms relative to target onsets were used.</s><s>However, epoch rejection was based on trials from the parametric regressions, thus the same trials were

extracted from singletrial data using second-order Butterworth filters, and calculated using the Hilbert transform separately for each of five occipital electrodes (O1/O2/ Oz/PO8/PO7) and averaged (either by normal average or by circular averaging of phase).</s></p><p><s>To explore whether delta phase was correlated with perceptual sensitivity, we investigated the correlation between delta phase and contrast gain in two steps.</s><s>(1) For each time point and participant, delta phase was separated into 36 successive but partly overlapping bins (the width of each bin in radians varied so that each bin contained 30% of all trials).</s><s>For each bin corresponding to a particular delta-phase range, the proportion correct as a function of target contrast was calculated, and performance was measured by fitting sigmoidal Weibull functions.</s><s>In other words, the analysis used was identical as the one used on behavioral data, but now separated according to different phases of delta phase.</s><s>By doing so, we were able to observe how psychophysical threshold values varied as a function of delta phase.</s><s>As in the behavioral data, threshold was taken as the predicted contrast level (expressed in logarithmic units) corresponding to an accuracy of 75%.</s><s>The negative signed threshold was used as a measure of contrast gain, as this value works as an index of a performance gain from their estimated threshold.</s><s>( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) At the group level, data from all participants were pooled and the circular-linear correlation was calculated, as implemented in the CircStat toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berens, 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To investigate whether delta phase was concentrated, in terms of phase locking, around the phase that corresponded to the best performance (or "best phase"), we first estimated what would be the best phase for each subject, time, and condition.</s><s>Because phase is a circular variable, we performed a linear regression of contrast gain with the sine and cosine of delta phase and calculated the corresponding preferred phase as:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y ϭ ␤ 0 ϩ ␤

estimated coefficients for the linear regression <ref type="bibr">(Wyart et al., 2012b)</ref>.</s><s>After having estimated the values of best phase, we then compared them with the observed mean phase.</s><s>First, we calculated the circular distance (the circular equivalent of a subtraction) of the best phases for each subject with the observed phases.</s><s>When similar, these distances would be concentrated around zero.</s><s>We then performed a V test to test whether these values were significantly concentrated around zero.</s><s>This test is a modified version of the Rayleigh test for uniformity, and tests the null hypothesis that the population is uniformly distributed around the circle with the alternative hypothesis that the population is not uniformly distributed, but rather has a specified mean angle.</s><s>We used the test as implemented in the CircStat toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berens, 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For the fit of the accumulation rate

interest, compensating the smaller number of trials used in each bin and avoiding large fluctuations in the parameter space due to this smaller number of trials.</s></p><p><s>To test whether the relationship between delta phase and accumulation rate was different across experimental conditions, a similar linear regression as previously described was used with the sine and cosine of delta phase as regressors for each participant <ref type="bibr">(Wyart et al., 2012b)</ref>.</s><s>The peak-to-peak effect size ␤ pref was estimated for each participant and condition using:</s></p><formula
