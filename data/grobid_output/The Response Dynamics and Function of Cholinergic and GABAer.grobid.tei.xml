existence of both feedforward and feedback connections between the olfactory system and the basal forebrain.</s><s>In vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake animals have further demonstrated the dynamic nature of HDB neural activity during associative olfactory discrimination learning: basal forebrain neurons are recruited slightly before trial initiation in successful discrimination trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nunez-Parra et al., 2020)</ref> and baseline neural activity in the HDB increases during the acquisition phase of an odor-reward association <ref type="bibr"

signaling is rapidly modulated during olfactory learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hanson et al., 2021)</ref>, how cholinergic activity correlates with the stages in an olfactory task remains elusive.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we addressed these questions by recording neural activity from cholinergic and GABAergic HDB neurons in mice undergoing passive odor exposure and odor-reward associative learning.</s><s>Our data suggest that cholinergic and GABAergic neurons display distinct response dynamics during passive odor stimulation and olfactory learning, and play different roles in odor discrimination.</s></p></div>

during odor associative learning may be responsible for the stable responses of HDB cholinergic neurons throughout the go/go task.</s><s>On the other hand, GABAergic responses decayed rapidly toward the end of the go/go task, indicating that HDB GABAergic neurons may not be activated during reward learning.</s><s>Thus, the distinct dynamics in cholinergic and GABAergic neurons resulting from different neural activity states may explain why the responses in cholinergic neurons remained stable but the responses in GABAergic neurons decreased over time.</s><s>Differing levels of activity have been previously reported for basal forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons: whereas cholinergic neurons were consistently excited during reward association in a go/no-go auditory discrimination task, GABAergic neurons exhibited diverse responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Harrison et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>However, further investigation is required to examine how HDB cholinergic neurons respond to odor vs. reward, and during which task period these neurons play an important role.</s></p><p><s>The possibility that the odor response of cholinergic neurons is shaped by attention is further supported by results from the go/no-go experiment, during which these neurons showed divergent responses to the rewarded odor (S+) and the unrewarded odor (S-) after the mice had learned the odor discrimination task.</s><s>The faster decay of responses during S-trials may reflect reduced attention to the unrewarded cue in proficient mice.</s><s>Conversely, the cholinergic responses to the S+ and S-were similar during the learning phase, when the mice had not learned to discriminate between the two odors and attention to both stimuli was necessary.</s><s>Electrophysiology and fiber photometry recordings have shown that odor-evoked responses in the olfactory bulb diverge after learning and that mitral/tufted neurons carry information about odor value <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Doucette and Restrepo, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s>This neural representation strategy is likely shaped by top-down innervations, such as the noradrenergic <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Yamada et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ramirez-Gordillo et al., 2018)</ref> and serotonergic (unpublished data) inputs to the olfactory bulb.</s><s>However, since separated responses were also observed in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the present study, it is important to investigate whether and how HDB cholinergic inputs also contribute to odor representation in the olfactory bulb during odor discrimination.</s></p><p><s>Many studies have investigated the function of HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in olfaction.</s><s>Selective lesion of cholinergic neurons that project to the OB, inactivation of cholinergic neurons, and pharmacological blockade of acetylcholine receptors all decrease performance in some olfactory behaviors, including olfactory habituation, perceptual generalization, and odor discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Linster et al.,

indicate that both cholinergic and GABAergic projections are crucial for sensory processing and olfactory learning.</s></p><p><s>However, in the present study, although we found that cholinergic neurons play an important role in odor discrimination, GABAergic neurons may not be involved in this type of associative learning.</s><s>HDB GABAergic responses to the S+ and S-did not separate during either the first block or the best block.</s><s>Furthermore, whereas inactivation of cholinergic neurons impaired odor discrimination, task performance remained high in mice with inactivation of HDB GABAergic neurons.</s><s>The apparent conflict between our results and those from previous studies is likely due to the different behavioral tasks used.</s><s>To test the ability to discriminate odors, Nunez-Parra et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) used a habituation/dishabituation test, which is an instinctual response to odors and does not require an active learning process; we used a go/no-go test, which requires active learning to associate specific odors with the reward.</s><s>Another potential alternative explanation for the discrepancy is that odor experience during associative learning leads to plastic changes that compensate for the effects caused by the GABAergic neurons.</s><s>Thus, the HDB GABAergic neurons may be involved in discriminating odors instinctually but not when the discrimination requires associative learning.</s></p><p><s>In summary, this study demonstrates the distinct dynamics of HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons during odor-association learning, and the different roles these two subpopulations play in odor discrimination.</s><s>These findings are important for understanding the top-down regulation of sensory systems by different subpopulations of basal forebrain neurons.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | The response profiles of HDB cholinergic and GABAergic neurons during passive exposure.</s><s>(A) Diagram of virus injection.</s><s>To record the calcium responses of HDB cholinergic neurons, AAV-ChAT-Cre and AAV-DIO-axon-GCaMP6s were injected into the HDB of C57BL/6J mice.</s><s>(B) Sections showing expression of GCaMP6s in the HDB from a C57BL/6J mouse following virus injection.</s><s>Scale bar: 50 µm.</s><s>(C) Diagram of virus injection.</s><s>To record the calcium responses of HDB GABAergic neurons, AAV-DIO-axon-GCaMP6s were injected into the HDB of VGAT-Cre mice.</s><s>(D) Sections showing expression of GCaMP6s in the HDB from a VGAT-Cre mouse following virus injection.</s><s>Scale bar: 50 µm.</s><s>(E,I) Heat maps and traces of ∆F/F for the first three trials (early trials) and the last three trials (late trials) in cholinergic neurons (E) or GABAergic neurons (I) from representative mice under repeated odor (Isoamyl acetate) exposure.</s><s>(F,J) The trial-averaged traces of ∆F/F in (E) and (I), respectively.</s><s>(G,K) The odor (Isoamyl acetate) responses in cholinergic (G) and GABAergic (K) neurons decreased in late trials compared with early trials [(G) paired t-test, t (7) = 5.53, P = 8.9 × 10 -4 ; (K) paired t-test, t (10) = 4.59, P = 0.001].</s><s>(H,L) The ∆F/F in cholinergic (H) and GABAergic (L) neurons also decreased upon repeated exposure to other odors (2-Heptanone, Phenyl acetate, and Benzaldehyde, respectively) [(H 1 ) paired t-test, t (7) = 8.37, P = 6.8 × 10 -5 ; (H 2 ) paired t-test, t (7) = 3.37, P = 0.012; (H 3 ) paired t-test, t (7) = 4.68, P = 0.0023; (L 1 ) Wilcoxon signed-rank test, z = 2.85, P = 0.0044; (L 2 ) Wilcoxon signed-rank test, z = 2.93, P = 0.0033; (L 3 ) paired t-test, t (10) = 3.60, P = 0.0049].</s><s>*P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,79.54,64.19,435.93,412.99" type="bitmap" /></figure>
