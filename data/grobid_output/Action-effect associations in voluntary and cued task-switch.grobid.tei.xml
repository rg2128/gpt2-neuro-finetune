(2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Herwig and Waszak (2009)</ref> pointed out, the learning mode in the acquisition phase may also influence the integration of action-effects in the ensuing test phase.</s><s>Therefore, they contrasted a free-choice acquisition phase with a forcedchoice acquisition phase.</s><s>By testing the impact of the acquisition phase in a forced-choice test phase, they found a non-reversal advantage for the free choice acquisition group, but not for the forced choice acquisition group.</s><s>Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Herwig et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Herwig and Waszak (2009)</ref>, concluded that participants who had undergone stimulus-based learning did not acquire actioneffect links.</s><s>Experiments on stimulus-response compatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kunde, 2003)</ref> and stimulus-effect compatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hommel, 1996)</ref> suggest another explanation.</s><s>It is assumed that participants acquire testable action-effect associations in both learning modes, but only the free-choice acquisition group uses the action-effect links in the test phase.</s><s>To test this alternative explanation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pfister et al. (2011)</ref> performed the same experiment as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Herwig et al. (2007)</ref> but replaced the forced-choice test phase by a free-choice design.</s><s>If both acquisition groups (free-choice and forced-choice) learned action-effect associations, participants who acquired action-effect binding in the forced-choice group should also show a consistency effect in a free-choice test phase.</s><s>This is what the authors could show.</s><s>Their results indicated that the acquisition of action-effect associations did not depend on the action control mode in which they were learned.</s><s>Only the use (operationalized in the test phase) seems to be dependent on the action control mode.</s></p><p><s>As illustrated above, the acquisition and use of action-effect binding under different action control modes have been primarily studied with rather simple choice-reaction tasks in free-and forced-choice designs.</s><s>Although action-effects are assumed to play a crucial role in response selection, there are only a few studies targeting the impact of action-effects in task selection.</s><s>Task selection is often studied with the task-switching paradigm.</s><s>Task-switching reflects the flexibility of the cognitive system when being confronted with multiple task requirements.</s><s>In everyday life, we often have to decide what to do.</s><s>Thus, we perform an action in order to achieve a goal by neglecting all the other opportunities that could interrupt the ongoing action.</s><s>But if a new goal or task is more prominent, the cognitive system must be able to abandon the current task by reconfiguring the current task set in order to select and perform another action.</s></p><p><s>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Logan and Gordon (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Logan and Schneider (2010)</ref> a task-set can be defined as a set of parameters that program task-specific processes such as perceptual encoding, memory retrieval, response selection, and response execution.</s><s>If action-effects influence response selection as seen in experiments with free-and forced choice designs, it is conceivable that they will also influence task selection and task execution in task-switching.</s><s>In a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kiesel and Hoffmann (2004)</ref>, pressing a key (one and the same action) led to two different action effects (short/fast vs. long/slow movements of the target) in a horizontal and vertical arrangement: Reactions were slower in the slow-movement context and faster in the fastmovement context, although the target movements occurred after the response was given.</s><s>Thus action-effect associations are acquired context specifically and the context influences the way the same action (pressing a key) is performed (slowly or quickly).</s><s>In a study carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ruge et al. (2010)</ref>, two target stimuli were horizontally and vertically aligned.</s><s>A cue indicated whether participants had to determine the position of the horizontal or the position of the vertical stimulus.</s><s>Two different effect modes followed responses.</s><s>In the taskrelated effect condition, a red square appeared in the position of the correct response (e.g., left in the horizontal condition or above in the vertical condition).</s><s>In the task-unspecific effect condition, participants were just told whether they had performed correctly or not.</s><s>The authors found a significant two-way interaction between task transition and effect type for trials with a long-cued target interval (CTI, i.e., 1500 ms): in the task specific feedback condition, switch costs were reduced.</s><s>The authors interpret this result as meaning that task-specific feedback can help to disambiguate task-ambiguous response meanings (that is, the same response for two different tasks).</s></p><p><s>In order to further study the role of action-effects in taskswitching, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lukas et al. (2013)</ref> devised a new paradigm.</s><s>In an acquisition phase, participants performed magnitude and parity tasks in a cued task-switching paradigm.</s><s>A cue presented to the target (a number between one and nine without the five) indicated which task to perform.</s><s>Correct responses were immediately followed by consistently occurring action-effects in the experimental group and by inconsistent, random action effects in the control group.</s><s>In the transfer phase, the consistently and regularly occurring action-effects changed to a random mapping, so that the learned action-effect associations were no longer valid.</s><s>If action-effect associations were anticipated and facilitated, implying discrimination between competing task sets, then switch costs should be lower in the experimental group in the acquisition phase and should increase in the transfer phase.</s><s>This is exactly what <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lukas et al. (2013)</ref> found -at least for trials with a short cue target interval (CTI).</s><s>They interpreted the reduced switch costs in the acquisition phase to be due to the fact that participants activate the action effects as part of the current task set.</s><s>This helps to differentiate competing task sets.</s><s>However, in trials with long CTIs, the task set is already fully prepared so that there is no additional benefit by consistently occurring task effects.</s><s>In the test phase, it was shown that switch costs were increased after the learned action-effect associations were no longer valid.</s><s>This is further evidence that effects that occur as a consequence of an action play an important role, not only in simple-choice designs but also in more complex task designs.</s><s>Recently, this effect was replicated not only for switch costs, but also for N -2 repetition costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Schuch et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, it is noteworthy that acquisition as well as the use of action-effect associations could be shown in a design that is comparable to a forced-choice design (neither the task nor the key could be freely chosen by the participants).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Herwig and Waszak (2009)</ref> already assumed that with more complex S-R mappings, action effects might become more important and hence participants rely more on action-effect associations.</s></p><p><s>To pursue this thought, we conducted the present study with a cued task-switching paradigm (forced-choice design) and a voluntary task-switching paradigm.</s><s>Although key strokes in a voluntary task-switching paradigm are not completely freechoice (there is a correct and a wrong response), participants still have the freedom to choose the task they want to perform.</s><s>Hence, we equalize this paradigm with free-choice designs in simple-response studies.</s><s>In line with the results obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lukas et al. (2013)</ref> and also at least tending in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schuch et al. (2017)</ref> with respect to N -2 repetition costs, we assumed that consistent action-effect mappings in the acquisition phase should lead to better performance than randomly assigned action-effects in both task-switching paradigms.</s><s>However, the main focus of the present study was to investigate consistency effect (i.e., tasks are chosen according to previously learned task-effect associations) and non-reversal advantage (i.e., previously learned task-effect associations improve task performance and switching between tasks when matching effects are presented before task selection) by employing a task-switching paradigm.</s><s>Thus, we introduced a cued task-switching paradigm, similar to the forced choice designs (sensorimotor learning mode) and a voluntary taskswitching paradigm similar to the free-choice designs (ideomotor learning mode).</s><s>In two experiments, participants learned taskresponse-effect associations either in a cued or in a voluntary task-switching design.</s><s>In Experiment 1, consistency was tested by presenting the previous learned action-effects before task selection in a voluntary task switching paradigm (to distinguish the preceding "action"-effects better from the action effects in the acquisition phase, they are called practiced effects in the following).</s><s>In line with consistency effect, subjects should tend to choose the task that was previously followed by the respective effect.</s><s>In Experiment 2, the non-reversal advantage was tested by presenting the previous learned action-effects before the task cue.</s><s>In line with non-reversal advantage, subjects should react faster and be less error prone when the respective practiced effect matches the following task.</s><s>Moreover, we were interested in determining whether the integration of action effects in a task set is limited to the response level or takes place on a higher hierarchical task level.</s><s>That means, for instance, that participants have learned the association between pressing a certain key and the screen turning to green for numbers smaller than five.</s><s>When, during the test phase, the practiced effect is a screen turning to green and the target number is greater than five, they are more likely to press the key assigned in which the screen turns to yellow when task-effects are integrated on the task level.</s></p><p><s>EXPERIMENT 1</s></p></div>

white on a black background in the center of the screen with a height of 1.3 cm (visual vertical angle 1.24 ‚Ä¢ ).</s><s>Participants had either to decide whether a number was larger or smaller than five (magnitude task) or whether it was odd or even (parity task).</s><s>For one task, they had to press the period-key and the y-key with the right and left index finger, for the other task they had to press the q-key and the p-key with the right and left middle finger.</s><s>The keys arranged on the left side of a standard QWERTZ-keyboard were always assigned to odd or less than five, and the keys arranged on the right side were assigned to even or greater than five.</s><s>The task-key assignment was counterbalanced across participants.</s></p><p><s>Participants of the ideomotor learning groups (EG 1 and CG 1) were instructed to choose between one of two tasks based on these instructions: "In this experiment you have to perform one of two tasks, the magnitude task or the parity task [...].</s><s>You yourself may choose which task you are going to perform next.</s><s>Keep in mind that you must switch regularly, so that you are performing the two tasks in an approximately equal proportion."</s></p><p><s>In the sensorimotor learning groups (EG 2 and CG 2), participants were cued as to which task to perform.</s><s>The cues were a square or a diamond that framed the stimulus.</s><s>The square indicated the parity task, the diamond the magnitude task.</s><s>First, a fixation cross appeared in the middle of the screen for 500 ms.</s><s>Immediately after, the cue was presented and 500 ms later the stimulus appeared (CTI = 500 ms).</s><s>Cue and stimulus stayed on the screen until a response was obtained.</s><s>If there was no response after 2500 ms, they disappeared and a message appeared, prompting participants to respond faster.</s><s>If participants pressed the wrong key, an error message appeared.</s><s>The error message was displayed on the screen for 500 ms immediately after the wrong response with a letter height of 0.3 cm (during the acquisition phase and the relearn block).</s><s>In the test phase, errors were indicated on the screen with a more prominent letter height of 1.3 cm.</s><s>Only correct responses were immediately followed by action-effects.</s><s>For one task, a large green or yellow square (19.5 cm in length) appeared as action effect on the screen for 500 ms and a high or a lowpitched tone was emitted for 500 ms for the other task.</s><s>On the response level, the action effects differed in regard to their features (green, yellow, high or low).</s><s>The action-effects differed also on a higher dimensional level, i.e., for one task visual action effects appeared and for the other task auditory action effects appeared.</s><s>The assignment of tasks and action-effects (e.g., visual/magnitude task, auditory/parity task) was counterbalanced across participants (see for example Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>The green square and the deep tone were always assigned to the responses "even" or "smaller."</s><s>The yellow square and the high tone were always assigned to the responses "odd" or "larger, " respectively.</s><s>In the control groups (CG 1 and CG 2), action-effects were randomly assigned.</s><s>Each response-effect combination was possible with equal probability.</s><s>Therefore, there was no consistency between response and effects, neither on the response level nor on the task level.</s></p><p><s>In the test phase of both experiments, the practiced effects were presented before task selection.</s><s>Every practiced effect could now be followed by any target.</s><s>That is, 32 combinations of practiced effect and target were possible, of which half of them were learned associations and half of them had not been associated before.</s><s>For instance, the low tone was associated with the response "smaller" and hence with small target numbers, but never with larger target numbers.</s><s>A low tone followed by the number 9 would hence be an unknown association.</s><s>The practiced effect (presented for 500 ms) was followed by the target after a gap of 200 ms (i.e., inter-stimulus interval [ISI] = 700 ms).</s><s>Participants were instructed to freely choose which task to perform.</s><s>After correct responses, the screen stayed

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consistency Effect</head><p><s>In Experiment 1, the previously learned action effects turned to practiced effects in the test phase.</s><s>The test phase consisted of a voluntary task-switching paradigm.</s><s>The ratio of the chosen tasks that matched the previously learned task-effect association was analyzed (i.e., consistency effect).</s><s>It was shown that participants chose responses matching formerly learned response-effect mappings in greater number than those due to random effects.</s><s>This was independent of the learning mode.</s><s>That is, we can confirm that the acquisition of action-effect associations takes place in a more complex task environment in sensorimotor as well as in ideomotor learning modes (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pfister et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>By splitting up the data in the test phase of Experiment 1, we found that participants selected responses that matched previously learned stimulus-response-effect-associations above random response rates.</s><s>However, participants did not select tasks according to task-effect associations.</s><s>Sharing the same modality did not seem to be sufficient to link to one task (i.e., visual effects are linked to the parity task).</s><s>Accordingly, the integration of sensory effects in the task-set of the numerical selection tasks, applied in this study, seems to take place on a response level and thus prompts the key-press (the goal-directed movement) and not the mental categorization per se.</s><s>This does not mean that task-effect associations do not exist.</s><s>However, in this study they were too weak to show evidence for bi-directional task-effect associations.</s><s>It is for instance conceivable that task effects need to be task-relevant or that tasks and effects have a logic relation to one another.</s><s>Hence, the mechanisms underpinning the retrieval process are still not clear.</s><s>Referring to feature-integration theory, the preceding stimuli trigger the response only on condition that there is a complete feature overlap.</s><s>If under the same condition (e.g., number less than five), there is a feature-mismatch (the color of the preceding stimulus is yellow and not green as in the acquisition phase), the response belonging to the matching task (magnitude) is not prioritized.</s><s>Further research is necessary in order to determine whether the retrieval mechanisms of taskeffects work in an all-or-none manner or rather in a manner of graded/weighted correspondence/overlap.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-reversal Advantage</head><p><s>In Experiment 2, the non-reversal advantage was the focus of interest.</s><s>The acquisition phase was exactly as in Experiment 1, but the test phase consisted of a cued task-switching paradigm.</s><s>The cued task was preceded by formerly learned action effects.</s><s>We analyzed whether task performance was facilitated when the preceding effects matched formerly learned action-effect associations.</s><s>Regarding RT, there was only a small hint with a tendency that participants who had acquired action-effect associations in an ideomotor learning mode reacted faster in task consistent trials.</s><s>The results of the error rate support this tendency.</s><s>Task-consistent trials were less error prone than task inconsistent trials only in the ideomotor learning groups and rather for the experimental groups.</s><s>There are several explanations as to why the effect of non-reversal advantage was not clearer.</s><s>The main problem is, as mentioned above, the loss of power due to much exclusion of participants from analyses.</s><s>Moreover, with respect to the non-reversal advantage one has to keep in mind that in earlier studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Elsner and Hommel, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Herwig and Waszak, 2009)</ref> the preceding effect itself served as an imperative stimulus and no additional cue was presented.</s><s>It is possible that the cue in the cued task-switching paradigm overlaps the non-reversal advantage.</s><s>Maybe the non-reversal advantage would be more prominent if the practiced effect itself would serve as cue.</s></p><p><s>Also the CTI has to be taken in consideration with respect to the results.</s><s>In the <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lukas et al. (2013)</ref> study, two different CTIs had been applied.</s><s>The worsening effect of task-switch costs when changing consistent action effects into random action effects was only seen in the condition with short CTI.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schuch et al. (2017)</ref> used a CTI of 500 ms.</s><s>They found clear effect of increased switch costs only in the error rate.</s><s>In the present study, the CTI was also 500 ms in the acquisition phase and even longer (700 ms) in the test phase.</s><s>It is possible that the effect of action effects in task switching is transient and other cognitive processes take over control in task performance with longer CTI.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Performance</head><p><s>Analyses of the acquisition phase revealed that action effects especially help task performance in a voluntary taskswitching paradigm: RT is faster with consistent action effects during voluntary task-switching.</s><s>Usually, free-choice tasks are performed slower than forced-choice tasks, as they are accompanied by additional cognitive processes.</s><s>It is assumed that these processes reflect generating internally a task goal (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Naefgen et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Providing action effects in a voluntary task-switching paradigm might accelerate this goal generating process.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have shown that action effects can help to create task-ensembles <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Weaver and Arrington, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Although no task-ensembles were used in the presented study, but only a flat non-hierarchical task structure (to each task and each response belonged one specific effect), it was assumed that action effects in a voluntary task-switching paradigm can contribute in reducing switch costs, as has been shown by previous studies with a forced-choice task switching paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ruge et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lukas et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, we found larger switch costs for the groups with consistent action effects than for the groups with inconsistent action effects.</s><s>Likewise, in the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lukas et al.

(2015b)</ref> for instance argue against the separation of two action control systems.</s><s>Although we cannot reject this statement based on our results, the debate of how learning mode affects task performance is not yet completed.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Janczyk et al. (2015a)</ref> question whether free-choice tasks are an appropriate method to study voluntary actions.</s><s>One might also raise the question with respect to our study.</s><s>We argue that it was exactly the underlying task (and the accompanying higher cognitive effort) that we wanted to investigate with respect to action-effect learning.</s><s>Although we are not convinced that it is completely inappropriate to study action control with voluntary responses, we concede that one might consider alternative research methods in the future.</s></p><p><s>To sum up, it was shown that specific action-effect association were used for task selection in more complex task environments.</s><s>Evidence for non-reversal advantage was rather shown for error rate.</s><s>Action effects help to reduce reaction time in a voluntary task switching paradigm, but switch costs are not affected.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 3 |</head><label>3</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 3 | Error rate in percent of Experiment 2 in the test phase as a function of experimental condition, learning mode in the acquisition phase and task consistency.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="8,116.61,411.09,360.00,264.78" type="bitmap" /></figure>
