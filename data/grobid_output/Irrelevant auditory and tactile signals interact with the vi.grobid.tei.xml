<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Our environment continuously provides information through physical signals that are transduced and processed by various sensory systems.</s><s>Although the study of human perception has long focused on isolated senses, in the last decades the interaction between different sensory systems has started to gain interest.</s><s>Many scientists now believe that the nature of purely visual contexts studied in the laboratory is quite different from the multisensory scenarios found in more ecological settings; and that vision per se is often influenced at early stages by other modalities such as audition.</s><s>Let us consider a daily life situation: as we wander in a fun fair the sudden explosion of a balloon on the right side of our visual field will automatically attract our gaze.</s><s>This orientation behavior facilitates further sensory processing needed for a fast reaction to a potential danger.</s><s>The resulting brief acoustic signal and salient visual change generated by the explosion are transmitted in the air and then transduced by our auditory and visual systems at different speeds.</s><s>Although these signals reach the brain areas responsible for their integration at different moments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2]</ref>, we will most likely perceive them as simultaneous.</s><s>Moreover, depending on the distance to the blowing balloon, the auditory signal might reach the observer either before or after the visual signal.</s><s>The mechanisms involved in the subjective timing of natural events must then show some degree of flexibility to determine whether each unimodal component originate from the same causal source, before combining them into a single multisensory event (for a detailed review on the causality in perception, refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the observed advantage of the visual modality over other senses for spatial processing does not hold for the temporal domain: the auditory system is more sensitive and reliable than the visual system to process the timing of events <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</s><s>When presenting a flash just before or after a short beep, the visual stimulus is perceived closer in time to the auditory stimulus than it actually is <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Consistently, the perception of a flash shifts either forward or backward in time when paired with a lagging or leading sound click, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s><s>This perceptual phenomenon could have consequences in visually-guided motor tasks.</s><s>This is nicely illustrated by the spatial shift of a visual flash that is presented after a saccade in conjunction with a tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The flash is mislocalized as if it had occurred closer in time to the tone.</s><s>However, a recent study showed that in a visually-guided hand motion task, dynamic motion estimation relies almost exclusively on faster proprioceptive feedback rather than on the more accurate visual feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>This puzzling finding shows that the brain considers both sensory variance and temporal delays to compute the optimal motor behavior.</s><s>Back to our example, the blowing sound would affects the moment when we visually perceive the visual counterpart of the balloon explosion, the latter being shifted in time toward the auditory signal.</s><s>This could have consequences on the timing of the saccade that would be programmed to bring the retinal image of the event onto the fovea.</s><s>For instance, if the balloon is distant enough, the blowing sound will reach our ears and be processed after the visual signal.</s><s>The temporal multisensory binding will then delay the moment we perceive the explosion.</s><s>Would this delay the execution of eye movements towards the location of the explosion as well?</s><s>In other words, does this temporal binding also influence the motor response latency executed in reaction to the multisensory event, or will the motor response be mostly visually guided, regardless of the audiovisual perceptual illusion as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>?</s></p><p><s>We addressed this questions in a series of experiments using saccadic eye movements as a probe model, for they allow measuring small differences in processing time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, these eye movements are partly controlled by the superior colliculus (SC), a well-known brain structure also involved in multisensory processing.</s><s>In mammals, the SC in which sensory and motor maps are connected transforms sensory inputs into motor commands <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The mechanism underlying gaze fixation has been proposed to involve fixation cells in the rostral SC, which inhibit the generation of saccades through the excitation of omnipause neurons in the brainstem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, SC was also the first structure where audiovisual integration in time and space was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>: neurons in the superficial SC layers respond to visual stimuli and neurons in the intermediate and deep SC layers also respond to auditory stimuli, such that auditory and visual sensory maps are connected at a very early processing stage.</s></p><p><s>Audiovisual interactions in monkey SC modulate saccade-related activity, though less than what expected from earlier recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>This physiological organization has functional consequences that might be observed in behavioral studies.</s></p><p><s>Only a handful of studies have investigated the influence of signals from non-visual sensory modalities on the execution of saccades.</s><s>Ross &amp; Ross <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> used continuous warning signals-onset or offset of either sounds or visual symbols at fixation-around the time of target onset.</s><s>Saccade latencies were shorter for auditory signals presented 300 ms, 100 ms or 0 ms before target onset, indistinctly for sound onset or offset, when compared to latencies in conditions without warning signals.</s><s>However, the nature of these effects proved to be different from what was observed with visual signals as saccades were delayed when visual stimuli were displayed after target onset.</s><s>Moreover, onset and offset of visual signals differentially affected the execution of saccades.</s><s>However, the study used a group design and lacked data points precisely where strongest multisensory interactions are expected to happen, that is, for stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) within [-100 ms; +100 ms]).</s><s>Another study reported a facilitation modulated with SOA ranging between -50 ms and +100 ms for spatially congruent sounds, which disappears with incongruent sounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, the limited number of participants (N = 3) constrained statistical conclusions and weakened the impact of the study.</s><s>Similar multisensory latency variations have been reported for SOAs ranging from -30 ms to +120 ms, again modulated by the spatial congruency between the sound and the visual target <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>These multisensory influences have an effect on saccades that could share similar mechanisms and combine with the gap/overlap effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Saccade latencies decrease when fixation disappears before target onset (gap) and increase when fixation remains after target onset (overlap).</s></p><p><s>Another line of research focused on the effects of spatial congruency across modalities.</s><s>Saccades toward a visual target had shorter or longer latencies when an auditory distractor was spatially aligned or misaligned, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>These effects depend on the physical distance between the visual target and the sound source <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>.</s><s>For combined congruent audiovisual targets, the latency decrease was well predicted by independent race models, suggesting that multisensory integration in the target selection is not optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, inhibiting saccades toward an auditory distractor when the fixation point is already turned off proved more difficult than when the fixation remains visible at the target onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, revealing an interaction between disengaging fixation and the target selection in the SC.</s><s>Importantly, tactile stimulations as well influence saccades, both in the spatial and temporal dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>: latencies are reduced when a touch is delivered before target onset, the facilitation being maximal when the touch and visual target are spatially congruent <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Reactive saccades (i.e.</s><s>stimulus-driven) have been observed using purely somatosensory stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, which points to early interactions of the visual and tactile modalities in the generation of saccades.</s><s>The best locus candidate being again the deep layers of SC <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The current project brings new insights into the multisensory interactions occurring when programming and executing eye-movements.</s><s>We investigated whether an irrelevant stimulus delivered around the appearance of a visual target, which expectedly alters the perceived timing of the target onset, might influence saccade latencies.</s><s>Specifically, we used auditory (experiments A and B), visual (experiments C and D), tactile (experiment E) and combined tactile and auditory stimuli (experiment F) to probe the effects of multisensory temporal integration on the possible mechanisms underlying the selection and execution of saccades.</s><s>Our results indicate reliable SOA dependent multisensory effects on saccadic reaction time when using sounds or touches.</s><s>Visual stimuli, on the other hand, appear to produce a different behavioral pattern, indicating that temporal integration requires signals from different modalities.</s></p></div>
