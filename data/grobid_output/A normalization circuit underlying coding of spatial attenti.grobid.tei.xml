<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recordings</head><p><s>We recorded neural data using a Blackrock Microsystems Cerebus Neural Signal Processor and Cereport Adapter (Blackrock Microsystems).</s><s>We recorded from one of three blocks of 32 channels on the 96-channel array; these blocks were fixed across all experimental sessions.</s></p><p><s>The broadband signal was bandpass filtered (0.3-7.5 kHz) and digitized to 16 bits at a sampling rate of 30 kHz.</s><s>We detected individual spikes from this signal using a digital high-pass filter (250 Hz/four pole) in conjunction with a voltage threshold crossing of 4ϫ root mean squared noise amplitude.</s><s>These spikes and their associated waveforms were sorted offline manually using Offline Sorter v2.4 (Plexon Inc.).</s><s>Single units (referred to as single neurons in this study) were distinguished from multi-unit activity, and were used for the remainder of the study.</s><s>We isolated in 458 single units (199 across 11 sessions in Monkey F; 259 units across 12 sessions Monkey JL).</s><s>We did not assume that recorded units were the same from day to day.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental setup</head><p><s>Gabor stimuli were projected onto a computer screen placed 1 m from the subjects' eyes using a video projector (NEC WT610, 1024 ϫ 768-pixel resolution, 85-Hz refresh rate).</s><s>Experimental parameters of the task were controlled using custom-made software.</s><s>Animal gaze positions were monitored using an infrared-based eyetracking system (Eyelink 1000, SR Research).</s><s>Saccade detections were accomplished by thresholding eye movement velocity at 25°/s.</s><s>Subjects were seated in a standard primate chair, and were administered juice rewards via an electronic reward system (Crist Instruments) via a tube attached to the chair.</s><s>A lever was installed to the chair and used by the monkeys to commence a trial.</s><s>The chair ϩ screen ϩ pre-amplifier setup was shielded from electromagnetic interference with a Faraday cage.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental task</head><p><s>The paradigm consisted of two classes of experimental trials: attention trials, and fixation trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>In both trial types, subjects initiated a trial by fixating within 2°of a central fixation dot and depressing a lever, which had to be depressed for the entire length of a trial.</s><s>Following a fixation period of 110 ms, the trial protocols diverged.</s><s>The animals performed several hundred trials of randomly interleaved attention and fixation trials in each recording session.</s><s>Successfully completed trials of either type yielded a juice reward and were followed by a 300-ms intertrial interval, while error trials had a 3000-ms waiting time with a black screen and no reward.</s><s>The rule for all trial types can be succinctly stated as follows: saccade quickly to a cued change, otherwise maintain fixation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention trials</head><p><s>In attention trials, after the 110-ms fixation period, a circular Gabor stimulus (the "cue"), 1.5°wide with a spatial frequency of 2.5°and tilted at 45°, was presented at one of four possible positions around the fixation point, selected at random: an angle of 45°(top left), 135°(top right), 225°(bottom right), or 315°(bottom left), at 5°e ccentricity.</s><s>The cue indicated where on the screen they should covertly direct spatial attention while maintaining fixation in the center of the screen.</s><s>After 363 ms of cue presentation (cue epoch), three distractor stimuli identical to the cue appeared at the remaining three positions, and all four stimuli (three distracters and cue) remained fixed on the screen for a random interval [585,1755 ms] (delay epoch), after which the trial would proceed in three possible ways, chosen randomly.</s><s>(1) In "target" trials, the target orientation rotated 90°clockwise for 200 ms.</s><s>Subjects had 400 ms following the onset of the target rotation to saccade to the target to successfully complete the trial.</s></p><p><s>(2) In "distracter" trials, the 90°clockwise rotation occurred in the distractor stimulus diagonal to the target, and the monkey was required to maintain fixation to successfully complete the trial.</s><s>(3) In "target ϩ distracter" trials, changes occurred simultaneously in the target and distractor at the diagonal location.</s><s>Subjects had to saccade to the target to successfully complete the trial, while an "error" trial was defined as the lack of a saccade to the target or the presence of a saccade to the distractor.</s><s>Animals typically completed 200 of each type of attention trial in a single recording session.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixation trials</head><p><s>On trial start in fixation trials, no cue stimulus was presented to the animals, and the screen remained blank for the duration of the cue epoch (363 ms) before four stimuli, identical to those used in attention trials, populated the four visual quadrants of the computer screen simultaneously.</s><s>As in the attention trials, these four stimuli remained on the screen for a jittered duration of 585-1755 ms; however, in these trials, the subjects had no explicit instruction directing their covert spatial attention.</s><s>A "correct" trial required the subject to maintain their gaze on the central fixation point for the duration of the trial.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculation of chance performance levels</head><p><s>We calculated chance performance levels by considering the types of responses the animal can produce and the probability to get a reward if the animal chooses to randomly produce one of these responses after the change in the target.</s><s>The target, distracter, and target ϩ distracter trials comprise five options: saccade to one of the four targets, or withhold a saccade, yielding chance ϭ 20%.</s><s>Fixation trials comprise two options: saccade or withhold a saccade, yielding chance ϭ 50%.</s></p></div>
