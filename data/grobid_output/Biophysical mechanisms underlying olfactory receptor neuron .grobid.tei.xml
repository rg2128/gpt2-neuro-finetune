<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The fluctuations created by a turbulent odor plume can carry useful information about the chemical environment, and there is evidence that insects use this information to help locate odor sources1,2.</s><s>Yet olfactory systems appear to be poorly suited to encoding fluctuations, because even simple odor pulses generally elicit prolonged temporal patterns of activity in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs).</s><s>These patterns include epochs of excitation and inhibition, and vary with ORN type, odor identity, and odor concentration3-6, often somewhat unpredictably.</s><s>A key question in olfactory coding is thus how these first-order neurons transform and encode the dynamics of fluctuating stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Many mechanisms have been proposed to shape the dynamics of ORN responses.</s><s>These include second-messenger pathways7,8, neuromodulators9, or buffering by odorant binding proteins10,11.</s><s>However, recent discoveries suggest that olfactory transduction in insects may be simpler than previously thought.</s><s>First, swapping odorant receptors between the maxillary palp.</s><s>In this study, we focused on the palp, which contains only six ORN types, arranged as stereotyped pairs in three types of sensilla4,18 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>Spikes arising from the two ORNs in a sensillum can be sorted based on their size4, or by genetically ablating one type of ORN (see Methods).</s></p><p><s>In extracellular recordings from single palp sensilla, odors evoke both a change in spike rate and a deflection in the local field potential (LFP, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>The time course of the LFP reflects the time course of the local transmembrane current19 (see Methods) and a downward deflection in the LFP indicates a depolarization of local dendrites20.</s><s>The sensillar LFP is thought to arise mainly from transduction currents21.</s><s>To confirm this, we verified that spikes do not affect LFP dynamics.</s><s>Injecting a Na + channel antagonist (TTX, 50 μM) into the palp abolished spiking, but had no effect on LFP time course (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Control injections of saline had no effect.</s><s>These data are consistent with the idea that the LFP is a proxy for transduction currents, although we cannot exclude a contribution from conductances downstream of transduction but upstream of spiking.</s></p><p><s>Next, we asked whether under certain conditions, the LFP response can be attributed to a single ORN.</s><s>First, we chose concentrations of specific odors that drive robust responses in a particular ORN type (pb1A).</s><s>The pb1A ORN normally expresses the receptor gene Or42a.</s><s>We found that a mutation in Or42a eliminated most pb1 responses to these odors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>), indicating that they are due to this single receptor type.</s><s>Some of these odors also drove responses in a second sensillum type (pb3) which were unaffected by mutating Or42a (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>This result indicates that palp sensilla can be electrically isolated from one another, because responses arising from pb3 sensilla are either absent or strongly attenuated in intermingled pb1 sensilla.</s></p><p><s>Under other conditions, we observed that LFP responses can propagate between nearby sensilla.</s><s>In particular, LFP responses in antennal sensilla were not well-isolated (data not shown), probably because they are packed more densely than palp sensilla.</s><s>For this study, we recorded only from palp sensilla, and we used genetic ablation of one ORN in a sensillum, or careful choice of odors, to insure that the LFPs we recorded arose from single ORNs.</s><s>In each case, we confirmed that the LFP response was largely abolished when the cognate OR was mutated and/or the cognate ORN was killed genetically (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamics of transduction and spike generation</head><p><s>The LFP and spike rate have distinct dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>The LFP time course is similar to the time course of the odor.</s><s>By contrast, the spike rate is highest when the LFP response is growing and lowest when the LFP is recovering.</s><s>This implies that the spike rate is sensitive to the slope of the LFP.</s></p><p><s>To describe these relationships quantitatively, we calculated the linear filters that best summarizes each transformation.</s><s>To calculate the linear filter relating the odor to the LFP, we presented a fluctuating odor waveform while recording the LFP, then cross-correlated the odor waveform with the LFP waveform, and finally corrected for correlations in the odor waveform.</s><s>Similarly, we also calculated the linear filter that relates the LFP to the spike rate.</s><s>We did this by cross-correlating the LFP with the spike rate, and then correcting for correlations in the LFP.</s></p><p><s>We found that the filter describing the transformation from odor to LFP had a single lobe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>), indicating that the LFP tends to smooth odor fluctuations.</s><s>The lobe is negative because odor increases elicit downward deflections in the LFP.</s><s>The width of this lobe (105 ms half-width) indicates that the LFP faithfully tracks odor fluctuations up to ~6Hz (20 dB attenuation).</s><s>The interval between the lobe and zero indicates the absolute latency of the response, which is less than 10 ms.</s></p><p><s>To test the filter model, we used it to predict the response to a novel odor waveform (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s><s>The prediction was made by convolving the filter with the odor time course.</s><s>It accurately captured the coarse features of the LFP response (correlation coefficient 0.94 ± 0.006).</s><s>However, plotting the predicted versus the actual LFP revealed two separate curves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>), indicating that LFP onset and offset are asymmetric in a way that cannot be captured by a linear model.</s><s>We investigate these asymmetries in a later section.</s></p><p><s>The filter relating the LFP to the spike rate was biphasic (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>), indicating that the spike rate is sensitive to the LFP slope.</s><s>The order of the lobes (positive followed by negative) indicates that spiking is promoted by downward deflections in the LFP, and inhibited by upward deflections.</s><s>The slightly larger negative lobe indicates that the spike rate remains above baseline as long as a steady negative LFP deflection persists.</s><s>Convolving the spike filter with the LFP produced an excellent prediction of the actual spike response (correlation coefficient 0.97 ± 0.003; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>).</s><s>The spike filter was equally good at predicting responses to fast and slow LFP events, and to short and long odor pulses (data not shown).</s><s>Plotting the predicted versus actual spike rate revealed a small nonlinearity which is typical of neural responses: the curve flattens near zero because the actual spike rate cannot be negative, and saturates at high values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We note that this filter has structure to the right of the zero time point, whereas the true filter should not, because spikes are caused by the LFP.</s><s>This is an artifact of the slow time course of the LFP, which limits how narrow the calculated filter can be (see Methods).</s><s>An idealized filter that is realistically narrow and has no structure to the right of zero can perform as well as the recovered filter, whereas a monophasic filter cannot (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>This implies that the general biphasic shape of the filter is correct, but that its width is overestimated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Odor-and cell-dependent transduction and spiking dynamics</head><p><s>We next asked how the dynamics of these two transformations-transduction and spikingdepend on the odor and the receptor.</s><s>We recorded LFPs and spikes for several different ligand/receptor combinations.</s><s>For each combination, we calculated filters describing transduction and spiking.</s></p><p><s>Filters describing transduction were generally monophasic (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>), but their width and polarity depended on both the stimulus and the receptor (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, rows 1-3), corresponding to differences in the speed and polarity of the LFP responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Overall, these filters predicted the shape of the LFP well (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>), implying that transduction can be approximately described as a low-pass filter with a stimulus-and receptor-dependent width and polarity.</s><s>As in the example above, there were systematic discrepancies at odor onset and offset.</s></p><p><s>By contrast, filters describing the LFP-to-spiking transformation had a biphasic shape that was relatively similar across stimuli and receptors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>The magnitude of the filter was generally smaller for larger LFP fluctuations, consistent with the idea that neurons adapt to the scale of their inputs22-24.</s><s>This filter accurately predicted many details of the spike response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>).</s><s>For example, this filter predicts which responses show onset transients and offset inhibition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> first two rows).</s><s>It also predicts that when the LFP decays with multiple slopes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), there will be distinct phases of inhibited and elevated spiking during odor offset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, fourth row).</s><s>Finally, it predicts elevated spiking after offset of an inhibitory odor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> bottom row).</s><s>The success of this model implies that the transformation of transduction currents into spike rates can be described by a universal biphasic filter.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic manipulation of the differentiating spike filter</head><p><s>What accounts for the biphasic shape of the filter relating LFP to spike rate?</s><s>Hodgkin-Huxley models predict that the relationship between input current and spike rate depends on the balance of voltage-dependent Na + and K + conductances25.</s><s>When the Na + /K + ratio is high, the spike rate reflects a running average of recent input ("integrator" behavior).</s><s>When this ratio is low, the spike rate responds preferentially to the slope of the input ("differentiator" behavior).</s><s>To test whether the differentiating shape of the ORN spike filter reflects a specific balance of intrinsic conductances, we asked whether we could reshape the filter by genetically manipulating Na + conductances.</s><s>We chose Na + conductances as our target because there is only one Na + channel α-subunit in the Drosophila genome (DmNa v ).</s></p><p><s>We knocked down DmNa v in ORNs using transgenic RNA interference (RNAi).</s><s>This produced a general decrease in spike rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>) and a change in spike rate dynamics.</s><s>Specifically, the spiking response became more transient (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>DmNa v knockdown did not affect LFP dynamics, although it slightly reduced LFP magnitude (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The more transient spiking response suggests that the spike filter has become more differentiating.</s><s>To examine this directly, we calculated LFP-to-spike filters for a small number of neurons showing a knockdown phenotype (peak to steady-state firing rate ratio = 1.7-2.3).</s><s>In these ORNs, the positive and negative lobes of the spike filter were more symmetric-and thus more purely differentiating-than in controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5f</ref>), while the filter describing transduction was not significantly altered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5g</ref>).</s><s>Together these data suggest that the differentiating spike transformation in ORNs is specified by the regulated expression of voltage-dependent channels in these cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A kinetic model can explain asymmetry in transduction</head><p><s>We observed that linear filters approximately describe the time course of transduction.</s><s>However, filter predictions consistently underestimated the speed of transduction onset and overestimated the speed of offset (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>).</s><s>This is because transduction onset was always faster than offset.</s><s>A filter, having a single time scale, predicts an average of these two rates.</s></p><p><s>One model that can account for both of these phenomena is a kinetic model of ligand receptor interactions.</s><s>In the simplest case, the level of transduction current is related to the number of activated receptors (OR*), described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where O is the ligand, R is the receptor, and R* is activated receptor.</s><s>This model accounts for odor-specific transduction rates because the binding and activation constants depend on the identity of both the receptor and the ligand.</s><s>This model also accounts for the asymmetry we observed between onset and offset rates, because the forward reaction rate depends on the concentration of odorant available, while the reverse reaction rate depends only on the amount of bound receptor.</s></p><p><s>One prediction of this model is that onset rates should grow with concentration, while offset rates should not.</s><s>To test this prediction, we recorded LFP responses to several concentrations of two odors.</s><s>For both odors, we found that the onset rate grew with increasing concentration, whereas the offset rate was much less sensitive to concentration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>These data imply that some of the nonlinear features of transduction dynamics arise from elementary properties of receptor binding and activation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adaptation slows response kinetics</head><p><s>Another prominent nonlinearity in some responses was a slow decrease in LFP amplitude during the odor pulse (adaptation) which was most prevalent when responses were strong (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Adaptation was often followed by an overshoot after odor offset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>, see also Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>This type of adaptation persisted in TTX (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>), and so arises upstream from spiking.</s></p><p><s>To probe the mechanisms underlying adaptation, we compared the response to two short test pulses, before and after a long adapting pulse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref>).</s><s>Adaptation reduced the amplitude of the test pulse response.</s><s>This effect was reduced as the test pulse concentration increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, adaptation produces a rightward shift in the concentration-response function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6e</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, adaptation reduced the onset rate of the test pulse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), and this was also mitigated by high test pulse concentrations.</s><s>This suggests that adaptation acts on the activation of transduction, for example by reducing the affinity of the receptor for ligand or making it more difficult to open the transduction channel (see Discussion).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adaptation is not intrinsic to the receptor</head><p><s>In a simple scenario, adaptation might reflect inactivation of the odorant receptors themselves.</s><s>If so, then responses mediated by two receptors in the same ORN should not cross-adapt.</s><s>To test whether adaptation is intrinsic to the receptor, we ectopically expressed a second receptor (Or47a) in one palp ORN type (pb1A, which natively expresses Or42a).</s></p><p><s>To drive the two receptors independently, we found two stimuli (2-butanone &lt;0.1× and pentyl acetate &lt;0.02×) that were specific to each receptor (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we asked whether transduction cross-adapts.</s><s>We found that responses of either receptor type could be adapted by driving the other receptor for a prolonged period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Cross-adaptation was similar to self-adaptation, in that adapted responses were smaller and had slower onset rates.</s><s>Similar to self-adaptation, we found that crossadaptation could be overcome by using a high test pulse concentration (data not shown).</s><s>These results imply the self-and cross-adaptation are due to the same phenomenon.</s><s>Thus, adaptation must involve processes that are shared between receptors, either up-or downstream from the receptor.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adaptation is induced as a consequence of transduction</head><p><s>If adaptation is initiated by events upstream from ligand binding (for example, if adaptation is caused by depletion of a chaperone that delivers ligand to the receptor) then it should be triggered equally well by odors that inhibit transduction.</s><s>In contrast, if adaptation is initiated downstream of transduction, then an inhibitory odor should not produce adaptation.</s><s>To ask whether adaptation is initiated up-or downstream of ligand binding, we ectopically expressed a receptor that produces an inhibitory response in pb1A ORNs (OR47b).</s><s>As before, we used stimuli that act specifically on the native receptor (2-butanone 0.1×) and the ectopic receptor (1-octanol 0.1×, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In these ORNs, we observed that the inhibitory response did not produce adaptation of the excitatory response.</s><s>To the contrary, a prolonged inhibitory response appeared to de-adapt the cell: the response to the excitatory test pulse became larger and had a faster onset rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c</ref>).</s><s>This implies that adaptation does not depend on odor merely binding to the receptor.</s><s>Rather, adaptation depends on transduction.</s><s>In the same ORNs, we observed that the excitatory response reduced the inhibitory response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7d</ref>).</s><s>(Any effects on onset rate were unclear in this case, because the test pulse coincided with the overshoot produced by the adapting pulse.)</s><s>ORNs ectopically expressing OR47b had significantly higher rates of spontaneous activity than normal ORNs of the same type (36.4 ± 17.9 versus 12.8 ± 2.6 spikes/s s.d., p&lt;0.01, ttest, n=6-9, see Methods), consistent with a previous report that OR47b confers high spontaneous firing rates when mis-expressed30.</s><s>Interestingly, ORNs with the ectopic receptor also had significantly smaller initial responses to 2-butanone (0.1×) (11.0 ± 5.2 versus 20.3 ± 2.5 mV s.d., p&lt;0.01), consistent with the idea that a high basal level of transduction places the cell in a more adapted initial state.</s><s>These results further support the idea that adaptation is induced as a result of the transduction channel opening, or something downstream.</s><s>The finding that adaptation alters onset kinetics implies that adaptation targets the pathway leading up to transduction channel opening.</s><s>Because the target of adaptation is upstream of where adaptation is induced, adaptation likely requires a negative feedback signal.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Responses to natural odor plumes</head><p><s>Our results demonstrate that ORN response dynamics arise from the interaction of two dynamical steps, transduction and spike generation.</s><s>How do natural plumes engage these two distinct steps?</s><s>To create plumes, we used a fan to produce an air current, and we placed a vial of odor upwind from the fly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8a</ref>).</s><s>Plumes reaching the fly were monitored using a photoionization detector.</s><s>Consistent with previous reports1,2, wind-borne odor signals were intermittent.</s><s>Odor fluctuations were rapid at high windspeeds and slower at low windspeeds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8a</ref>).</s><s>When the odor source was displaced laterally, the frequency of odor encounters decreased, and when the source was moved away, encounters became less discrete (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8a</ref>).</s><s>Thus, odor fluctuations provide information about odor source location.</s><s>Because fluctuations are slowest at low windspeeds, adaptation is likely to be most relevant in this regime.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with our filter calculations, transduction filtered plumes in a ligand-and receptordependent manner.</s><s>For some ligand-receptor combinations, the LFP faithfully tracked every plume, even at high wind speeds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8b</ref>).</s><s>For other ligand-receptor combinations, LFP signals were much slower (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8c</ref>).</s><s>To quantify this, we compared the power spectra of these signals.</s><s>While the power spectra of plume fluctuations (as reported by the photoionization detector) were similar across ligands, LFP signals were low-pass filtered with a cutoff frequency that depended on the odor-receptor combination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To examine how LFP dynamics depend on LFP amplitude, we identified isolated LFP events, and we binned and averaged these events by amplitude (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8e</ref>).</s><s>This analysis was performed under conditions that increased the incidence of discrete odor encounters (close odor source, high windspeed).</s><s>We found that the shape of these LFP events was similar for small and large amplitudes, indicating that complex transduction dynamics (like adaptation and overshoot) are not strongly engaged in these conditions.</s><s>Rather, every plume hit generates an LFP response with similar dynamics.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we asked how spike generation shapes the response to natural plumes.</s><s>For each LFP event, we identified the associated spike train, and computed the average spike rate associated with each average LFP amplitude.</s><s>Small LFP events produced disproportionately large spike rates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>), meaning that spike generation tends to emphasize encounters with weak stimuli.</s><s>The spike response consistently peaked before the LFP response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8f</ref>), indicating that spike generation increases the speed of encoding.</s><s>Accordingly, we found that the power spectrum of the spike rate contained comparatively more power at high frequencies than the power spectrum of the associated LFP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8h</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the transformation from transduction to spiking promotes rapid and sensitive encoding of natural stimuli.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input currents and spiking as distinct dynamical processes</head><p><s>Many studies have described the early stages of neural encoding in terms of linear filters, sometimes followed by a static nonlinearity22,23.</s><s>Recently, these techniques have been applied to olfactory systems as well16,24,26.</s><s>The general approach of these studies is to summarize all the dynamical steps between the stimulus and spiking in a single filter.</s></p><p><s>Here we have adopted a different approach, motivated by the observation that input currents and spikes have different dynamics.</s><s>After separating input currents from spiking using genetic and pharmacological tools, we characterized their dynamics independently.</s><s>We found that transduction was described by an integrating filter.</s><s>In contrast, spiking was described by a differentiating filter.</s><s>Thus, transduction smoothes the input signal, while spike generation differentiates the transduction response, thereby emphasizing some of the high-frequency fluctuations that were diminished during transduction.</s></p></div>

results show that these slow dynamics originate at the level of transduction, not spiking.</s><s>Our results also pinpoint where these dynamics arise.</s></p><p><s>First, we find that adaptation depends on transduction channel opening.</s><s>Whereas an excitatory odor response increased adaptation, an inhibitory response decreased adaptation.</s><s>Because the effect of an odor on the adaptation state of a cell depends on how the odor affects transduction, adaptation cannot be induced prior to transduction.</s></p><p><s>Second, we find that adapted responses look like unadapted responses to a lower odor concentration. .</s><s>Specifically, onset rates are slowed.</s><s>This result rules out a mechanism where adaptation increases the rate of transduction shut-off, because this would produce faster rather than slower kinetics33.</s><s>It also rules out a mechanism where adaptation targets an intrinsic conductance downstream of transduction, because this would not slow the rate of transduction onset.</s><s>Finally, adaptation is unlikely to be due to a change in the driving force for transduction currents, because adaptation outlasts the LFP response to the adapting pulse by several seconds.</s><s>Adaptation is most likely to involve a decrease in ligand binding affinity, and/or a decrease in the efficacy of channel gating, both of which slow onset kinetics.</s></p><p><s>Third, adaptation likely involves a diffusible factor.</s><s>Adaptation is induced as a consequence of transduction channel opening, but targets the activation of transduction, implying a negative feedback signal.</s><s>What might this signal be?</s><s>Previous studies reported that mutations in either IP 3 receptors or the TRP channel can reduce adaptation in Drosophila ORNs7,34, suggesting a role for cytoplasmic calcium.</s><s>Furthermore, odors induce calcium influx in heterologous cells expressing Drosophila odorant receptors12.</s><s>Resting calcium in these cells is decreased by an extracellular chelator, consistent with our conclusion that transduction and adaptation can occur spontaneously.</s><s>Thus, calcium is a good candidate for a diffusible adaptation factor.</s></p><p><s>The transduction channel in Drosophila ORNs probably contains the Or83b gene product, because a mutation in the putative pore domain of this gene changes the ionic selectivity of the channel15.</s><s>Odorant receptors are thought to form heteromeric complexes with OR83b12,13,35.</s><s>Alternatively, odorant receptors may gate OR83b through a direct but transient association15.</s><s>Our results are broadly consistent with either alternative.</s></p><p><s>If the receptor forms a stable heteromer with OR83b (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, Model 1), then adaptation likely involves changes in both affinity and efficacy.</s><s>Decreasing affinity is necessary to explain the rightward shift in the concentration-response function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6e</ref>), while decreasing efficacy is necessary to explain the overshoot after odor offset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>).</s><s>Alternatively, if the activated receptor gates OR83b through an additional step (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, Model 2), both overshoot and the rightward shift can be explained by a decrease in the efficacy of channel gating.</s><s>In this model, overshoot arises because both spontaneously-active receptors (R*) and odor-activated receptors (OR*) have a diminished ability to open the channel.</s><s>A rightward shift in the concentration-response function occurs so long as the pool of activated receptors can fully activate most of the available transduction channels at high odor concentrations (see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In mammalian ORNs, adaptation is due to calcium-calmodulin acting as an allosteric inhibitor which reduces channel gating.</s><s>This process reduces the apparent affinity of the transduction channel for ligand36.</s><s>Although olfactory transduction is fundamentally different in Drosophila versus mammals, olfactory adaptation is qualitatively similar: in both cases, adapted responses resemble responses to lower odor concentrations.</s><s>Similar observations have been reported in moth ORNs37.</s></p><p><s>In most sensory systems, adaptation helps extend the dynamic range of encoding by adjusting the range of neural responses to the current range of stimulus intensities.</s><s>This idea is consistent with our finding that adaptation in Drosophila ORNs represents a negative feedback loop which adjusts the apparent affinity of the receptor for the odor.</s><s>Because adaptation strongly reduces weak responses but weakly reduces strong responses, it should make ORNs relatively insensitive to small fluctuations in the level of background odor, without compromising the ability of ORNs to encode large fluctuations.</s></p></div>
