<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Using continuous metabolic and behavioral phenotyping, the current study demonstrated that the behavioral patterning of food intake, inactivity, and NEAT is dependent on diet (chow vs. HFD).</s><s>Animals were more likely to be inactive within their home cage and spent less time eating when they were switched from a chow diet to a HFD.</s><s>In a separate cohort of animals, access to HFD resulted in a decrease in energy expenditure from physical activity, such that the efficiency of energy expenditure during movement was reduced in animals on HFD.</s><s>When CNO was administered to animals on HFD, NEAT was increased in the hours following injection, suggesting that activation of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus increases energy expenditure from physical activity.</s></p><p><s>The effects of HFD on total time spent engaged in food intake were likely due in part to the decreased total effort required by the animals on HFD to consume the same number of calories as those on chow, an idea supported by the similarity in total food intake, expressed as mean kCal/day, between the chow-fed and HFD groups.</s><s>Furthermore, increased inactivity in animals on HFD may be explained by reduction in anticipatory food intake responses.</s><s>As fewer trips to the food hopper were required to obtain an equivalent number of calories relative to the chow fed group, less anticipatory food intake behavior would be expected.</s></p><p><s>Additional characterizations of diet-induced changes in behavioral allocation examined the probability of remaining inactive following a bout of food intake.</s><s>Animals on HFD were more likely to remain inactive for longer periods of time (&gt;60 sec) compared with animals on chow.</s><s>The mice on chow, in contrast, were inactive following bouts of food intake for shorter periods of time (&lt;60 sec).</s><s>These results suggest that following HFD intake, SPA is decreased for prolonged periods of time, which likely contributes to increased weight gain.</s><s>These results coincide with what is known about sedentary behaviors in obese humans.</s><s>Individuals who engage in obesity-related eating behaviors tend to engage in less physical activity and more sedentary behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>This is found particularly in children, who have decreased their physical activity over the last ~50 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, chronic consumption of a high-fat diet has been shown to decrease the number of orexin-positive neurons in the LH <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, research in our lab has shown that rats bred for lower activity levels have reduced pre-pro orexin mRNA in the LH, show reduced responsiveness to orexin-mediate increases in SPA following injections of orexin directly into the LH, and more readily develop diet-induced obesity in response to HFD compared to rats bred for high activity levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To determine the energetic consequences of the diet-induced change in activity and eating behavior, NEAT was measured during the two diets.</s><s>HFD decreased NEAT during the dark cycle, which resulted in decreased total NEAT over 24 hours.</s><s>This effect was abolished within the first several hours following orexin neuron activation.</s><s>Orexin neuron activation increased 24 h cumulative NEAT in the HFD group, restoring NEAT to that of the chow-fed control animals.</s><s>Changes in behaviors were then examined within animals given HFD with and without injections of CNO, to determine the cause of the observed increased NEAT in this group.</s><s>The HFD+CNO group spent a similar percent time inactive, compared to that of animals in the HFD group, indicating that the amount of daily time spent inactive was not due to orexin neuron activation.</s><s>In contrast, when the probability matrix was used to analyze the probability of remaining inactive following food intake, the activity profile of mice given HFD and CNO no longer differed from those on chow for time spent engaged in a long lounge (data not shown), indicating that orexin neuron activation increases the probability of becoming active following a meal.</s><s>We then examined changes in the ratio of NEAT to SPA, and failed to find any difference between animals on HFD with and without CNO injections.</s><s>This suggests that the changes in NEAT following injections of CNO were not caused by an increase in efficiency of movement per se, but rather by an increase in SPA.</s><s>This change in SPA could not be due to changes in amount of time being active since there were no observed differences in the percent time inactive.</s><s>We next determined if there were changes in movement speed between animal on a chow diet vs. animals on HFD, and within the animals on a HFD group prior to and during CNO injections.</s><s>This analysis revealed that orexin neuron activation increased movement speed in animals on the HFD to that level observed in animals eating chow diet (control levels).</s><s>So, while the total percentage of time spent inactive throughout each day was unchanged, movement speed was increased, resulting in greater SPA without a change in total time spent inactive, which then resulted in increased NEAT.</s><s>In this study, we were specifically interested in the therapeutic potential of orexin neuron activation and focused on animals given an obesogenic HFD.</s><s>We did not explicitly study the effects of orexin activation on NEAT in animals maintained on chow, but based on previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>

measures of NEAT within this investigation also include the thermic effect of food (TEF).</s><s>Typically, NEAT is calculated as total daily energy expenditure -(basal metabolic rate + thermic effect of food) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Although the TEF represents only a small percentage (6-12%) of variability in total energy expenditure

TEF.</s><s>Based on this calculation, it is possible that our NEAT could be underestimated because the TEF for HFD is less than that of a chow diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, kilocalorie intake within each group was not different, and therefore overall TEF would not be different.</s><s>It is also possible that differences in

could not be accounted for in the present model.</s><s>Still, the small percentage of daily energy expenditure from the TEF renders this less of a concern.</s><s>After calculating NEAT, we then calculated the ratio of NEAT to SPA in animals on chow and HFD to determine the extent to which diet influences the efficiency of NEAT (thermogenesis during physical activity).</s><s>We found that animals on HFD were more efficient at expending energy (i.e.</s><s>conserved energy) during physical activity, as compared to animals on chow.</s><s>These data suggest that exposure to HFD reduces SPA and increases caloric efficiency of movement, such that less energy is expended for every bout of SPA.</s><s>This dual effect on SPA, and the NEAT produced by SPA, underscores the obesitypromoting effect of HFD.</s><s>While the energetic demand would be greater for larger animals, we accounted for this by dividing NEAT by total lean mass for each animal, and still found differences between the

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>The present study found that animals fed HFD spent less time engaging in feeding behavior and more time in periods of inactivity relative to animals fed chow.</s><s>In addition, HFD-fed animals had a greater probability of inactivity following a meal compared to animals eating chow.</s><s>Finally, NEAT was decreased in animals eating a HFD, and was increased to match the levels of that in control (chow fed) animals following CNO activation of orexin neurons.</s><s>Together these results suggest that consumption of high fat diet not only reduces overall physical activity and increases the chance of being inactive following a meal, but also reduces NEAT, such that SPA during HFD feeding burns fewer calories compared to SPA during chow feeding.</s><s>These results have significant implications for understanding how changes in physical activity contribute to obesity.</s><s>Mean +/-SEM probability, expressed as a percentage of total time in a 24 h period, that a mouse would engage in long (panel A) and short (panel B) bouts of inactivity following a bout of food intake, averaged across all 10 days of access to chow and all 10 days of access to high=fat diet (HFD).</s><s>**p &lt; 0.01 difference between chow and HFD.</s><s>*p &lt; 0.05 difference between chow and HFD.</s><s>Mean +/-SEM time spent engaging in food intake (panel A) or inactivity (panel B) in animals with access to high-fat diet (HFD; n=4) or chow (n=4),, expressed as a percentage of total time in a 24 h period, for 10 total days.</s><s>Also shown is the time spent engaging in food intake or inactivity for animals on high-fat diet (n=4) during the subsequent 10 days of CNO injections.</s><s>**p&lt;0.01</s><s>difference between HFD and chow for the indicated days.</s><s>Mean +/-SEM energy expenditure of SPA every 30 minutes averaged across 10 days (panel A) and the total cumulative energy expenditure of SPA over 23 hours following injections of CNO (injections took place at time '0') averaged across 10 days (panel B).</s><s>Energy expenditure of SPA was defined as total energy expenditure every 30 minutes minus the energy expenditure during the 30 minutes of least activity for each animal, divided by that animal's lean mass, for animals (n =8) on chow, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD plus CNO.</s><s>@@p&lt;0.01</s><s>difference between HFD and HFD+CNO at the indicated time points; ##p&lt;0.01,</s><s>Mean +/-SEM ratio of NEAT to SPA, presented as the mean across all 10 days of testing, for animals on high-fat diet (HFD; n = 4), chow (n = 4), and HFD+CNO (n = 4).</s><s>The ratio was calculated as the mean total NEAT (total energy expenditure of SPA / lean mass) divided by the mean total SPA (meters traveled) for each animal across 10 days of testing.</s><s>##p &lt; 0.05 difference between chow and HFD.</s><s>Mean +/-SEM meters traveled per second for each animal, averaged across all 10 days of access to chow or HFD, and across all 10 days of CNO injections.</s><s>**p &lt; 0.01 difference from HFD.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Cre-dependent genetic targeting of orexin neurons.</s><s>(A) Schematic diagram of AAV vector encoding DREADD-mCherry driven by Elongation factor alpha (EFa1) promoter sequence and flanked by dual flox sites for recombination in the presence of Cre-recombinase.</s><s>Cre is driven by the prepro-orexin-promoter of Orexin:Cre mice.</s><s>(B) Schematic of anatomical targeting with stereotactic viral infusion.</s><s>Photomicrographs of coronal sections containing immunofluorescent orexin neurons (green) and hM3Dq-mCherry (red; C).</s><s>Percent of orexin neurons expressing mCherry (orange arrow head) in Cre::hM3Dq (D) and Wt::hM3Dq (E) mice.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="18,120.48,62.00,431.04,299.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
