<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prefrontal neurons display mixed selectivity during attentional switching</head><p><s>To examine how mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) ensembles operate when cognitive flexibility is required, we expanded an attentional control task <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> to incorporate a cue switching component (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>At the core of the task is sensory selection, where freely behaving mice select between spatially-conflicting visual and auditory targets.</s><s>On each trial, a mouse selects between the two targets based on one of two 100 ms-long learned cues; a high-pass (HP) or a low-pass (LP) noise burst.</s><s>These cues correspond to two rules -attend to audition and attend to vision respectively.</s><s>Mice were required to hold a pseudo-randomly presented cue in mind for up to one second by maintaining snout fixation in the initiation port prior to the simultaneous presentation of the two targets.</s><s>The targets corresponded to the spatial location of the reward being delivered through the right or left reward port (e.g.</s><s>left LED flash on an attend to vision trial signaled a response on the left reward port).</s><s>Correct performance was rewarded with 10 μL of condensed milk, while incorrect performance was punished with a timeout.</s><s>Logistic regression modeling of behavior across all mice used in this study revealed that they used the cue to guide their choices (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a-d</ref>, see Methods).</s></p><p><s>Once mice became proficient at using the auditory noise cues, we introduced two visual cues -an ultraviolet (UV) and green LED flash -which corresponded to the same rules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>).</s><s>To assess how mice switched from using one cue set to another, we trained mice to perform this task in blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>).</s><s>Mice had equivalent performance across both blocks regardless of their presentation order (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), suggesting that they utilized different cue sets equivalently.</s><s>Importantly, this demonstrates an ability to flexibly switch their attention when the cueing context changes.</s></p><p><s>Given the well-known role for the PFC in cognitive flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , we asked how PFC neurons (prelimbic cortex; see Methods) engage in this task.</s><s>Using unbiased trial-selection (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>) and spike waveform clustering analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> , we classified recorded neurons into two categories: regular spiking (RS, putative excitatory) and fast spiking (FS, putative inhibitory, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a-d</ref>).</s><s>As previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , a subset of RS neurons showed a brief increase in spike-timing reliability during the delay period.</s><s>We refer to these cells as transient (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e-g</ref> for classification of cells).</s><s>As a population, these transient cells tiled time in the delay period with distinct neurons responding at different time points (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, these cells could be further categorized into two groups.</s><s>One group responded selectively to one of the four learned cues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>, cue-selective, 233/1789, 5 mice), while another responded equivalently to two cues that had the same meaning, which may be interpreted as a single task rule (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>, f and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2i</ref>, cue-invariant 102/1789, 5 mice).</s><s>For example, a cue-invariant PFC neuron selective to the attend-to-vision rule responds with transient elevation in spiking reliability at the same delay period time in both LP noise and Green LED trials.</s><s>To our knowledge this type of cue-invariance, indicative of ruleselectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , has not been previously reported in mouse PFC.</s></p><p><s>In stark contrast to the transient RS neural responses, putative inhibitory FS neurons showed broad changes in spike rate that distinguished between the two cueing contexts but not rule meaning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>, h and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2j</ref>, 418 neurons 5 mice).</s><s>In fact, RS and FS populations encode distinct cognitive variables, with the rule signal being more readily decodable from RS neurons while the context signal being more readily decodable from FS neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s><s>Further analysis confirmed that RS neurons encode cues and rules through changes in spiking reliability (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, FS populations encode context through broader (persistent) changes in spike rates across both the inter-trial interval and the delay period.</s><s>It is important to note that, in addition to transient PFC RS cells, we observed another RS group that showed persistent spike rate changes that also correlated with context (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s><s>However, it was much harder to decode context from these cells compared to PFC FS neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further test if transient PFC responses were indeed due to the sensory cue, we omitted the cue on 20% of the trials (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>In addition to a decrease in behavioral performance, we observed a significant decrease in tuning strength of both PFC cueselective and cue-invariant neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b-d</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results indicate that transient PFC responses are due to the learned cue, with cue-selective cells representing a physical cue and cue-invariant cells representing its meaning as a task rule.</s><s>Is it possible that the observed mixed selectivity among cue-invariant neurons reflects the differential sampling of local cue-selective neurons in a context-dependent manner?</s><s>To address this question, we constructed a multi-neuronal generalized linear model (GLM, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1k</ref>) to predict the spike rate of each PFC neuron <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>In addition to external sensory variables, our GLM model also included coupling terms to capture the dependencies between neurons (see Methods).</s><s>These coupling terms were in the form of a coupling filter that allowed us to explain the effect that spiking in other simultaneously recorded neurons had on the unit being modeled.</s><s>Importantly, we used a rigorous cross-validation approach to statistically evaluate the predicted coupling and to constrain the parameters of the model (see Methods).</s><s>On average, the GLM was able to explain close to 75% of the response variance of both cue-selective and cue-invariant PFC neurons on each trial (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5ac</ref>).</s></p><p><s>By analyzing the strength of the coupling filters, we were able to make inferences about the functional connectivity between the different classes of PFC neurons.</s><s>This analysis revealed that cue-selective neurons are strongly coupled among themselves only if they encode the same cue, and do not receive substantial reciprocal coupling from cue-invariant neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1l</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, cue-invariant neurons receive strong functional inputs from cueselective neurons across both contexts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1m</ref>).</s><s>As such, based on this pattern of functional connectivity, we reasoned that task-relevant PFC computations are hierarchically organized, with cue-invariant neurons gaining their rule selectivity from cue-selective neurons across contexts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1n</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediodorsal thalamus encodes cueing context</head><p><s>The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) projects extensively to the PFC has a critical role in maintaining task-relevant activity in this cortical region <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, a recent study found that the MD might play a role in cognitive flexibility by recruiting cortical inhibitory neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Given our finding that FS neurons are contextually selective (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1h</ref>, i), we next asked how MD neurons responded in our context switching task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>In agreement with our previously published results <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , we found that a subset of MD neurons exhibited a transient increase in spiking reliability during the delay, and distinct MD neurons tiled the delay period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>Unlike PFC RS neurons, these transient MD neurons did not display cue-selective responses but had equivalent responses to both cues within the same block.</s><s>Additionally, another subset of MD neuron showed the same selectivity towards the cueing context but through persistent changes in spike rate over the delay period (Figs.</s><s>2c and 2d for classification of transient and persistent MD neurons).</s><s>At the population level, the cueing context was much more decodable from both persistent and transient MD neurons compared to PFC RS neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, across the PFC-MD network, MD and PFC FS neurons were the most informative of the cueing context, whereas PFC transient neurons were most informative of the rule (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Are these thalamic responses reflective of sensory input (i.e. the modality of the cues) or of something more cognitive?</s><s>To answer this question, we required mice to perform the task using blocks with cues of different modalities.</s><s>MD neuronal activity reflected these heteromodal cueing blocks (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S6a-d</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, when we presented all four cues in a randomized manner, we found MD neurons that responded to all four cues, suggesting that their combination was encoded as a single context (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6eh</ref>).</s><s>Altogether, MD activity reflects the statistical regularity of cue presentation over a multitrial timescale, which we refer to as the cueing context (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</s></p><p><s>What factors could explain this contextual selectivity in the MD?</s><s>We had previously shown that transient responses in the MD are dependent on PFC inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, one possibility is that the MD gains contextual selectivity from PFC inputs, either from persistent RS neurons or from cue-selective ones (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>To test these two models, we fit GLMs to MD neurons and analyzed how different PFC cell types contributed to their selectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2g</ref>).</s><s>PFC RS persistent cells did not contribute to spiking of either MD transient or persistent cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7c-f</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, more than 75% of the variance in the delay period activity of both transient and persistent MD neurons could be explained by inputs from cue-selective PFC neurons, with MD neurons more likely to receive inputs from the context-congruent cortical cue set (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h</ref>).</s><s>Also, consistent with the fact that PFC FS neurons do not project to the MD, we found that they exerted no causal influence on MD spiking, further validating the power of the GLM to infer biologically plausible circuit models (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7c,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, these findings suggest that MD neurons gain their contextual selectivity, at least partly, by pooling context-specific cue inputs from the PFC.</s><s>MD transient cells pool from PFC cells in temporally precise manner, while MD persistent cells pool from PFC cells over a broader temporal window (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further verify these model predictions, we expressed the inhibitory channelrhodopsin, iC ++, in PFC to directly inactivate its neurons or their terminals in MD [PFC MD ] (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2i</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8a-c</ref>) in a temporally precise manner.</s><s>We reasoned that if MD neurons derive contextual selectivity from the PFC then suppressing PFC MD inputs should decrease its selectivity.</s><s>To mitigate detrimental effect that bilateral PFC suppression as on behavior in this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , we suppressed the PFC unilaterally once the animal achieved stable performance in each block (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>This method allowed us to dissociate neural selectivity in the MD from changes in behavioral performance.</s><s>Suppressing PFC neurons themselves or their terminals in MD diminished contextual signals in the MD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>Notably, removing PFC input filters in the MD GLM had a similar effect on response predictability as suppressing PFC MD terminals, providing further experimental validation of our GLM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2k</ref>).</s><s>Finally, to test the idea that PFC inputs are causally involved in generating and not just modulating contextual selectivity in the MD, we suppressed PFC MD inputs on every trial during the cueing period (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>).</s><s>When performed unilaterally, this manipulation significantly decreased MD contextual selectivity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>), and when performed bilaterally, it significantly impaired behavioral performance (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9d-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Taken together, these results suggest that by pooling from cue-specific PFC neurons, the MD encodes the cueing context (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2l</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Encoding a cueing context is critical for behavioral performance and flexibility</head><p><s>Our results so far suggest that both MD and PFC FS explicitly encode cueing context, while PFC RS neurons encode other cognitive variables such as cue identity and rule.</s><s>We wondered if behavioral performance benefitted from such a behavioral encoding scheme, and if so, how?</s><s>We noticed that mice performed much better on sessions in which the four cues were separated into two cueing contexts compared to sessions in which the cues were equiprobable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>This performance advantage occurred regardless of how cues in the block were grouped with respect to modality.</s><s>Critically, although performance within either of the two blocks was higher than that when cues were fully randomized across the session, there was a clear and consistent behavioral detriment for 4-8 trials upon switching from one block to another (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>).</s><s>This decline in behavioral performance at the switch suggested that, despite previous learning, mice had to readjust to using cues in the new cueing set.</s><s>This behavioral switching dynamic was associated with several neural ones.</s><s>We found that cue-selective PFC neurons showed reliable spiking earlier than cue-invariant ones upon first exposure to the new context (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10a</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that the decrease in behavioral performance at the point of context switch could be due to a remapping of inputs onto the shared cue-invariant cells.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the temporal evolution of coupling filters from cue-selective to cue-invariant PFC cells on a trial on a trial by trial basis at the point of the switch (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10b</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>Intriguingly, the time taken for these coupling filters to stabilize followed broadly similar dynamics to that of the behavioral performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>) and could explain close to 87% of the variance in the behavioral switch latency -sessions which took longer for the mouse to switch were also associated with a longer time to stabilize cue-selective inputs into cue-invariant neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>).</s><s>This would be expected if PFC cue-invariance was the source of cognitive control signals (attend to vision vs. attend to audition).</s><s>In contrast, although the coupling between cue-selective PFC neurons and context-selective MD neurons followed broadly similar dynamics, they were too fast to correlate with behavioral performance (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10 c-g</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, the output of the PFC cue-invariant cells, and not the MD or PFC cueselective cells, are most likely utilized for controlling sensory selection and successful task performance.</s></p><p><s>These results also suggest that the contextual selectivity of the MD may be required for the generation of rule signals in the PFC by adjusting the functional connectivity between cueselective and cue-invariant PFC neurons in a context specific manner.</s><s>To causally test this model, we designed and executed a series of optogenetic perturbation experiments.</s><s>Our previous study demonstrated that bilateral suppression of MD neurons during the duration of the delay period diminished task-relevant activity in the PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>In addition, in tasks lacking a delay period, MD suppression, via halorhodopsin (see Methods) during the cueing period (100 ms) had minimal effect on behavioral performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>As such, we first asked whether cue-specific, interleaved and bilateral MD suppression had a measurable impact on behavioral performance.</s><s>Interestingly, once an animal achieved stable performance within a block, such manipulation had no impact (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>).</s><s>Instead, the biggest behavioral deficit that we observed was the prolonged time taken to achieve stable performance in the new context (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">11</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the idea that MD contextual signals are relevant for establishing PFC task-relevant connectivity patterns, this MD manipulation also increased the number of trials taken to stabilize cue-invariant representations in the PFC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g</ref>).</s><s>Notably, this laser manipulation had no unwanted effects on the MD as the same laser power and duration had no effect in mice that expressed GFP in the MD (data not shown).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MD neurons regulate PFC representational switching likely through cortical inhibition</head><p><s>In addition to the effects on behavioral performance and PFC representational stability, we also noted that temporally-precise MD suppression during the cueing period impacted cueselective PFC neural spiking.</s><s>Specifically, although the increase in spiking of cells preferring the second context was unaffected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3h</ref>), we observed that cells preferring the first context continued to fire even though their sensory cue was no longer present (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3i</ref>).</s><s>Suppressing MD terminals in the PFC (MD PFC ) resulted in a similar 'out-of-context' spike rate elevation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>).</s><s>Critically, these MD-dependent changes in PFC RS spiking activity were contrasted by changes in PFC FS firing; MD suppression attenuated the normal elevation of FS neural spiking associated with the second context (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3i</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, at least a subset of MD neurons

type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>), cue-selective PFC neurons received substantial MD inputs, which varied according to context (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>These functional inputs could be broadly segregated into two types; one predominantly inhibitory and another predominantly excitatory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref> inset).</s><s>Notably, these functional inputs originated from the two distinct MD functional subgroups; persistent MD neurons were more likely to provide inhibitory functional inputs, while transient MD neurons predominantly provided excitatory ones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Similar to MD neurons, PFC FS neurons also exerted a context-dependent inhibitory effect on cue-selective neurons, with FS neurons having a larger inhibitory effect on PFC neurons that prefer cues of the opposite context (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the idea that MD cell types may be exerting part of their effects on the PFC through local inhibitory circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , we found that MD inputs could explain more of the variance of PFC FS neuron firing than PFC cue-selective neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13a-c</ref>).</s><s>MD persistent neurons were more coupled to PFC FS neurons than MD transient neurons were (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>).</s><s>Also, in contrast to FS neurons, PFC RS persistent neural responses were poorly explained by inputs from either the MD or cue-selective PFC neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13d</ref>), reinforcing the notion that they may be part of a distinct functional circuit than the one under study.</s><s>Altogether, these results support a model in which the MD controls contextual switching by suppressing PFC neurons of the irrelevant context through mechanisms that involving cortical inhibition.</s></p><p><s>To further test this model causally, we needed to gain a degree of selectivity over the two identified functional MD subtypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4g</ref>).</s><s>MD neurons in vitro have a bimodal resting membrane potential distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , suggesting different degrees of excitability.</s><s>Because our analysis suggested that two MD populations are driven by different degrees of cortical engagement (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>), we reasoned that this might also be due to differential excitability which may impart differential susceptible to optogenetic inhibition.</s><s>Specifically, the less excitable MD population (likely transient MD cells) would require stronger or more coincident PFC inputs to fire and hence would be more susceptible to weak suppression.</s><s>Conversely, persistent MD neuron may be more excitable and would require weaker and less coincident PFC inputs to fire.</s></p><p><s>By parametrically controlling laser power on an animal-by-animal basis without influencing behavior (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14 a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>), we found that MD transient cells were far more susceptible than MD persistent cells to low levels of yellow laser power (556 nm, power at fiber tip: 0.6-1.1 mW, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4h</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14 c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>These laser powers did not have an appreciable effect on the spiking properties of MD persistent cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14 e-g</ref>).</s><s>Higher laser powers (power at fiber tip: 2.1-3.5 mW) affected both transient and persistent MD neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14h</ref>).</s><s>In support of the predictions made by our GLM, selectively suppressing MD transient cells with weak laser powers selectively eliminated excitatory functional inputs to the PFC but had no impact on the inhibitory functional inputs from transient MD neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4i</ref>).</s><s>Suppressing MD PFC terminals had a similar effect on the PFC without affecting the firing rates of these neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14i-k</ref>).</s><s>This manipulation also revealed a selective effect on the response properties of both transient PFC RS neurons subtypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15a</ref>), but not PFC FS neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4k</ref>).</s><s>In agreement with our earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , temporally-limited MD suppression had a stronger effect on the maintenance of these peaks rather than their initiation in the PFC, confirming that the MD is not the source of PFC cue information (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15b</ref>).</s><s>Although the congruence between terminal and somatic inactivation may be surprising, the relatively large volumes of MD terminals may have larger impact on somatic excitability than what would be expected otherwise.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with the idea that persistent MD neurons provide cross-contextual PFC suppression, strong laser suppression significantly increased "out-of-context" cue-selective PFC spiking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4l</ref>) and concomitantly decreased PFC FS neural spiking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4m</ref>).</s><s>Because of this, inputs from cue-selective PFC neurons onto cue-invariant neurons took a longer time to stabilize (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4n</ref>).</s><s>Weak laser suppression, which targeted only transient cell, did not have a similar effect.</s><s>Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that the MD has two distinct computational functions: (1) Transient MD cells maintain the context-relevant representation in the PFC, permitting cue information to be held in working memory; (2) Persistent MD cells suppress context-irrelevant representations in the PFC by recruiting FS neurons in a context-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure"
