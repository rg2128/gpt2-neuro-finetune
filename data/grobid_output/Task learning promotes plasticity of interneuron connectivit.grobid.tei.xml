survival rate and morphology <ref type="bibr">(Alonso et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mouret et al., 2008)</ref> and that newborn GC activity facilitates learning and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alonso et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, in the process of GC turnover, it remains unclear whether newly integrated cells establish novel connectivity patterns with MCs or simply replace the existing ones.</s><s>Our findings show that olfactory associative learning enhances MC input onto GCs, which complements a recent study showing that GCs receive stronger centrifugal input from extrinsic higher brain regions after olfactory learning <ref type="bibr">(Lepousez et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, our experimental evidence also suggests that GC inhibitory connectivity patterns are sharpened by neural activity.</s><s>In mice trained with olfactory learning, some GCs make narrower and more specific inhibition onto MCs.</s><s>This experience-dependent sharpening of inhibition may result from increased OB circuit activity, centrifugal input encoding valence information, and/or global neuromodulation to facilitate the formation of organized clusters of GC connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Willhite et al., 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Limited by our current method to identify different cell groups in the OB slices (large-scale intrinsic imaging to determine responding zones), we lacked reporters of neural activity and/or odor response profiles at single-cell resolution.</s><s>We tried to lessen this limitation by choosing odors that activated relatively large and nonoverlapping areas in the OB and with topographic maps that have been reported and studied extensively with both imaging and histological methods (immediate early gene detection).</s><s>We also used relatively high odor concentrations for training and imaging.</s><s>Therefore, it was very likely that recorded neurons in the given zones were responding to certain odors in training.</s><s>However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some neurons were misgrouped in our analysis, so an ideal experiment would be using activity-dependent fluorescent reporters to determine odor response profiles of recorded neurons.</s></p><p><s>By enhancing the excitatory input onto GCs and clustering GC inhibitory output, experience-dependent plasticity may facil- itate adult-born GC survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lin et al., 2010)</ref>, circuit integration, and connectivity refinement.</s><s>Regarding olfactory processing, whereas EPL interneurons may act to generally function in MC gain control, enhanced MC-to-GC excitation may allow tuning of inhibitory tone in specific MCs.</s><s>Furthermore, clustering of GC output may also play significant roles in synchronizing MC output and facilitate information coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Schoppa and Westbrook, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gala ´n et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schoppa, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>To summarize, assaying interneuron connectivity patterns in the OB using light-assisted functional connectivity mapping has provided further insight into both stable modes of inhibition provided by EPL interneurons as well as the dynamic plasticity capacity afforded by the continual integration of newborn GCs.</s></p></div><figure
