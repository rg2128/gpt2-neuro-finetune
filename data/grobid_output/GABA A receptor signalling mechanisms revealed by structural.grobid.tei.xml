<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>forming, regions.</s><s>This work provides a structural framework to integrate decades of physiology and pharmacology research and a rational basis for development of novel GABA A R modulators.</s></p><p><s>In vertebrates, GABA A Rs mediate both phasic and tonic neuronal inhibition in the adult central nervous system1-3.</s><s>Their dysfunction leads to channelopathies associated with epilepsy, insomnia, anxiety and chronic pain4.</s><s>GABA A Rs are among the most important human drug targets due to their many allosteric sites that bind compounds with anticonvulsant, anti-anxiety, analgesic, sedative and anaesthetic properties5,6.</s><s>Some of these, such as benzodiazepines (BZDs), typically positive allosteric modulators, entered clinical use decades before the identity of their receptors was known7,8 and were crucial for the isolation9, and subsequent cloning10, of GABA A Rs. Other GABA A R ligands are important research tools, including the antagonists picrotoxin (PTX) and bicuculine (BCC)5,6.</s></p><p><s>The binding modes and conformational impact of most GABA A R allosteric modulators are unknown.</s><s>Docking attempts had to rely on models based on homologous proteins, including the C. elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel α (GluCl)11, Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor12 or the human homopentameric β3 GABA A R13 structures, all distant from the physiological, heteromeric GABA A Rs. Crystallographic and single-particle cryo-EM studies have illustrated interactions of GABA A R-derived constructs with neurosteroids14-16, the agonist GABA17-19 and the BZD site ligands bretazenil (BRZ)20, and flumazenil (FLZ)18,20.</s><s>However, the use of engineered receptors, in detergents micelles, limits the interpretability of such structures.</s></p><p><s>Functional studies on small molecule GABA A R modulators have also raised numerous conundrums.</s><s>We will list here just a few examples.</s><s>It is not known why the two agonist (GABA) binding sites, which should be structurally identical, are not functionally equivalent21.</s><s>The mechanism of BZDs action is also unclear, despite their widespread use as sedatives and anxiolytics.</s><s>Moreover, unlike newer compounds such as bretazenil and flumazenil mentioned above, classical BZDs including diazepam (DZP, Valium) and alprazolam (ALP, Xanax) act specifically through GABA A Rs containing α1/2/3/5, but not α4/6 subunit types22, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref>.</s><s>What is the basis for this specificity?</s><s>The plant alkaloid PTX, one of the most widely used GABA A R antagonists24, is believed to act as a channel blocker.</s><s>However, its competitive antagonistic properties suggest that additional binding sites might exist25,26.</s><s>Another broadly used GABA A R antagonist, BCC, is thought to act competitively.</s><s>However, the BCC preference to bind resting over desensitized receptors suggests that it might also act allosterically27.</s><s>Where do important reagents like PTX and BCC actually bind, and how do they work?</s></p><p><s>To address these unknowns, here we present five structures of the human synaptic α1β3γ2L GABA A R in complex with PTX, PTX/GABA, BCC, DZP/GABA and APL/GABA, establishing the binding modes and structural impact of these ligands and explaining the molecular basis for their function.</s><s>In order to obtain structures where GABA A R can be observed in more physiologically relevant conformations, we employed a full-length receptor variant, from a thoroughly characterised cell line28 and reconstituted it in a lipid bilayer29.</s><s>Our results lay the foundation for understanding the fundamental principles of small molecule action on heteromeric synaptic GABA A Rs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Picrotoxin and GABA binding modes</head><p><s>We first solved the structure of the α1β3γ2L receptor in complex with PTX (800 μM) to 3.1 Å nominal resolution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a-f</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Supplementary Video 1).</s><s>PTX is an equimolar mix of two highly similar compounds, picrotin and picrotoxinin.</s><s>Our structure illustrates picrotoxinin, known to be the more active one, fully sequestered in the channel pore between the M2 2′ and 9′ rings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b-c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>, Supplementary Video 2).</s><s>This agrees with mutagenesis and electrophysiology results implicating the 2′, 6′ and 9′ M2 residues in PTX binding30-32 and suggestions that PTX becomes "trapped" in closed/resting GABA A R and GlyR channels upon agonist wash-off33,34.</s><s>The hydrophobic isoprenyl moiety is surrounded by the 9′ Leu ring, whereas the exocyclic oxygen atoms in the main PTX body form putative hydrogen bonds with the 6′ ring (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>In picrotin, the isoprenyl group is replaced by a polar tertiary alcohol, not compatible with the 9′ Leu ring interactions, explaining why this compound is less active.</s></p><p><s>We next determined a GABA A R structure in complex with PTX (800 μM) and the neurotransmitter GABA (5 μM) to 3.04 Å nominal resolution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a-c</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Supplementary Video 3).</s><s>The orthosteric GABA-binding sites are located at the two β3 + /α1 -interfaces [the principal (+) and complementary (-) annotation of subunit faces is used], capped by the extracellular loops-C of the β subunits18,19,29.</s><s>Reminiscent of the Torpedo nAChR α subunits35, in the agonist-free GABA A R the β3 loops-C adopt "open" (outwards-projecting) conformations, whereas in the PTX/GABA-bound state they are "closed" (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>).</s><s>Strong EM densities are present in the two orthosteric ligand binding sites allowing unambiguous modelling of GABA molecules in the "aromatic boxes" formed by β3Tyr157, β3Phe200, β3Tyr205 and α1Phe65 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e</ref>, Supplementary Video 4).</s><s>The GABA amino group engages in a cation-π interaction with β3Tyr205 and a network of hydrogen bonds involving the β3Glu155 carboxyl, main chain carbonyls of β3Ser156 and β3Tyr157, and the β3Tyr97 hydroxyl.</s><s>The GABA carboxylate forms salt bridges with α1Arg67 and hydrogen bonds with α1Thr130 and β3Thr202 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>).</s><s>The GABA binding modes we observe are generally consistent with those proposed in lower resolution α1β1γ2 and α1β2γ2 GABA A R models18,19, however there are differences in detail29.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Allosteric cross-talk between PTX and GABA</head><p><s>Co-application of PTX (800 μM) with GABA (5 μM) and Mb38 (2 μM) causes rapid and complete inhibition of whole-cell currents in HEK293 cells, with complete recovery after PTX washout (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f-h</ref>).</s><s>Unexpectedly, in both PTX-and PTX/GABAbound structures TMDs adopt the same conformation, where all five M2 helices present the hydrophobic 9′ Leu side chains towards the centre of the pore, constricting its radius to ~1.5 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2i</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that PTX inhibition is not caused by blocking an open pore, but by inducing and maintaining a closed pore conformation.</s><s>It is likely that, by stabilising the closed/resting TMD state, PTX affects the ECD conformation and impacts on agonist binding.</s><s>Indeed, it has been shown that PTX reduced the apparent agonist affinity in GABA A Rs26,36 and increased GABA dissociation37.</s><s>Therefore, TMD closure by PTX constitutes the basis for allosteric communication between the PTX and GABA binding sites and explains how PTX appears to act as a competitive inhibitor34,38,39 without binding to other receptor pockets.</s><s>We conclude that the PTX-bound structure best illustrates the α1β3γ2L receptor in a closed/resting state (closed TMD, agonist-free ECD).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanistic impact of GABA binding</head><p><s>Previous observations suggested that the two GABA binding sites may not be functionally equivalent21,40, and the β-E + /α-D -site was estimated to have a threefold higher affinity for GABA than the β-B + /α-A -one21.</s><s>By comparing ECDs in the PTX-versus PTX/GABAbound structures, both with closed-state TMDs, one could visualise the initial conformational changes at the two agonist binding sites upon GABA binding.</s><s>Closure of β3 loops-C, likely the first step in the process, triggers remodelling of the β3-B + /α1-A -and β3-E + /α1-D -interfaces which leads to an anti-clockwise (looking down the pore axis from the extracellular space) asymmetric rotation of all subunit ECDs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>).</s><s>This state is stabilised by new hydrogen bond networks involving the β3Gly158, β3Tyr205 and α1Arg85 residues.</s><s>The cation-π interaction between α1Arg85 and β3Tyr159 breaks and the α1Arg85 side chain moves to the periphery of the interface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>At the β3-B + /α1-A -interface, these changes allow the β3-B subunit to move closer to the α1-A subunit by 1.5 Å as measured between β3Gly33C α and α1Pro80C α , and the total buried surface between the two subunit ECDs increases by 184 Å (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2j</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>In the GABA-bound conformation, α1Phe15 and β3Phe31 residues form a hydrogen-π stacking interaction and the side chains of α1Arg85 and β3Asp163 form new salt bridges, further interlocking the β3-E + /α1-D -ECD interface and increasing its total buried surface area by 234 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, Supplementary Video 5).</s></p><p><s>The "incomplete" β3-B + /α1-A -interface closure in the PTX/GABA-bound structure, relative to β3-E + /α1-D -, delineates an intermediate conformation from which GABA can presumably dissociate more readily.</s><s>Interestingly, in the desensitised (high affinity to GABA41) receptor states, described later in this paper, both β3 + /α1 -interfaces close to the same degree.</s><s>We conclude that the PTX/GABA-bound structure represents a pre-active receptor state, where agonist induced conformational changes at the ECD level are not large enough to perturb the closed/resting TMD conformation42.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of bicuculline antagonism</head><p><s>A highly efficient competitive antagonist, BCC was expected to induce a bona fide GABA A R closed state43.</s><s>We first verified whether BCC could close the α1β3γ2L receptor pre-bound to Mb38.</s><s>In whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, application of a 42 second pulse of Mb38 produced currents (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>) that were inhibited (102 ± 7 %; n = 4) by coapplication of bicuculline (100 μM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>) in a reversible fashion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>).</s><s>We solved the cryo-EM structure of the α1β3γ2L heteromer in complex with Mb38 and BCC to 3.69 Å nominal resolution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a-c</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>EM densities corresponding to BCC were observed at both orthosteric agonist sites (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d</ref>), where the hydrophobic nature of its phthalide and isoquinoline rings allows it to interact with "aromatic box" residues β3Tyr157, β3Phe200, β3Tyr205 and α1Phe65 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>, Supplementary Video 6).</s><s>Relative to the PTX-bound structure, the β3-B and β3-E subunit loops-C flex inward, ~2.2 Å at the tip (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e</ref>), to accommodate BCC, but retain overall "open" conformations (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3f</ref>).</s><s>The channel pore of the BCCbound α1β3γ2 receptor is fully closed by the M2 residues at three levels, 9′, -2′ and 2′ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3f</ref>) and its subunit conformations are virtually identical to the PTX-bound structure (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>BCC binding to the orthosteric sites prevents closure of the β3 + /α1 -subunit interfaces and ECD rotation, and stabilizes TMDs in the closed/resting state, thus inactivating the channel.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benzodiazepine binding modes and mechanisms</head><p><s>We next solved cryo-EM structures of the α1β3γ2L receptor in complex with GABA and ALP, as well as GABA and DZP, to 3.26 Å and 3.58 Å nominal resolutions, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a-c</ref>, Extended Data Figure .</s><s>4a-f, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Supplementary Video 7).</s><s>In both structures, GABA molecules are bound to the orthosteric agonist pockets and ALP/DZP occupy the canonical BZD binding site at the α1+/γ2 -interface, where they form extensive interactions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4d-e</ref>).</s><s>Densities for ALP and DZP are well defined, allowing us to distinguish the fused benzene-diazepine from the pendant phenyl rings (Extended Data Figure .</s><s>4g-h, Supplementary Video 8).</s></p><p><s>The ALP/DZP binding modes are in agreement with the cysteine crosslinking experiments where isothiocyanate substitutions in the DZP C(7) position reacted with cysteines introduced at the α1His102, α1Asn103, γ2Asn60 positions and the DZP C(3) ones reacted with the α1Ser206Cys and α1Thr207Cys mutants44.</s><s>The chlorine atoms at the C(8) and C <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> positions in ALP and DZP, respectively, interact with the α1His102 side chain.</s><s>In α4/6 subunits the equivalent positions are occupied by arginine residues, whose larger side chains would sterically clash with ALP and DZP.</s><s>This can explain why classical BZDs do not act on GABA A R subtypes containing α4/6 subunits22,45,46.</s><s>The ALP and DZP-bound structures also demonstrate that BZDs with a pendant phenyl ring do not share the binding mode reported for the benzodiazepine antagonist FLZ and partial agonist BRZ18,20 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a-e</ref>).</s><s>FLZ/BRZ bind deeper and higher from the BZD pocket floor delineated by the side chain of γ2Asn60, possibly due to additional hydrogen bonds between the imidazole nitrogen and ester carbonyl of FLZ/BRZ (both groups are absent in ALP/DZP structures) and the hydroxyl group of γ2Thr14220 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In the DZP/GABA-bound map, we also observed two strong EM densities in the putative general anaesthetic binding sites at the β3 + /α1 -TMD interfaces47 (Extended Data Figure .</s><s>4i, Supplementary Video 9).</s><s>These are not present in the ALP/GABA-bound map and have a distinct shape attributable to DZP.</s><s>In these pockets, the DZP A ring forms hydrophobic interactions with β3Met286 and β3Phe289 and the phenyl ring points towards α1Pro233 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4f</ref>, Extended Data Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">. 4i</ref>).</s><s>Our structure validates previous electrophysiology and mutagenesis data suggesting the existence of secondary DZP binding sites, responsible for the anaesthetic activity and biphasic GABA A R potentiation at higher DZP concentrations40,48.</s></p><p><s>We
