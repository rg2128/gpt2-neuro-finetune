<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two types of PT neurons in Layer 5</head><p><s>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was used to produce a taxonomic classification of cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> in the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and in primary visual cortex (V1).</s><s>A total of 21,749 scRNA-Seq transcriptomes were collected, including 9,035 from ALM.
