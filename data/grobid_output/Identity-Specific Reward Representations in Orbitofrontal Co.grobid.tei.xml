<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Nineteen healthy human participants with no history of psychiatric illness (seven male; age, 20 -34; mean Ϯ SD, 25.0 Ϯ 3.45 years) gave informed written consent to participate in this study.</s><s>The study protocol was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board.</s><s>One participant was excluded from analysis because of excessive head motion (Ͼ4 mm), and one was excluded because of a high number of missed responses (Ͼ15%), resulting in data from 17 total subjects presented here.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Odor stimuli and presentation</head><p><s>Eight food odors, including four sweet (strawberry, caramel, cupcake, gingerbread) and four savory ( potato chips, pot roast, saute ´ed onions, garlic), were provided by International Flavors and Fragrances.</s><s>For all experimental tasks, odors were delivered directly to participants' noses using a custom-built computer-controlled olfactometer capable of redirecting medical-grade air with precise timing at a constant flow rate of 3.6 L/min through the headspace of amber bottles containing liquid solutions of the food odors.</s><s>The olfactometer was equipped with two independent mass flow controllers (Alicat), allowing for dilution of any given odorant with odorless air.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p><s>The experiment consisted of 3 separate days of testing.</s><s>On all 3 days, participants were instructed to arrive in a hungry state, having fasted for at least 6 h before testing.</s><s>All behavioral ratings were made on visual analog scales using a scroll wheel and mouse button press.</s><s>Pleasantness rating anchors were "most liked sensation imaginable" (10) and "most disliked sensation imaginable" (Ϫ10).</s><s>Intensity rating anchors were "strongest imaginable" and "undetectable."</s><s>Identity rating anchors corresponded to two-letter abbreviations of the two food odor rewards (e.g., SB for strawberry and PC for potato chip).</s><s>Subjects were compensated with $20 per hour of behavioral testing and $40 per hour of fMRI scanning.</s></p><p><s>Day 1: stimulus selection.</s><s>Participants first provided pleasantness ratings of the eight food odors.</s><s>Based on these ratings, one sweet odor and one savory odor were chosen such that they were matched as closely as possible in pleasantness.</s><s>Next, we acquired pleasantness ratings for the two selected odors across a range of odor concentrations, diluted to varying degrees with odorless air.</s><s>Based on these ratings, we selected two intensity levels for each odor, such that the two low-intensity odors had the same pleasantness and the two high-intensity odors had the same pleasantness.</s><s>Participants then provided independent pleasantness and intensity ratings on these four odors to verify the relationship between intensity and pleasantness (i.e., value).</s></p><p><s>Day 2: classical conditioning and test trials.</s><s>After a brief reminder of the selected odors, participants completed a training session consisting of alternating blocks of classical conditioning and probe test trials in which they learned associations between visual symbols (CS) and the food odors (US).</s><s>Two unique symbols were randomly designated to be paired with each of the four odors.</s><s>On each trial of the conditioning task, the CS was first presented on the screen above a white crosshair for 2.5 s.</s><s>The crosshair then changed from white to blue for 2 s, indicating that an odor was present and cuing the participant to make a sniff.</s><s>The odor presentation was immediately followed by an odor pleasantness rating and an odor identity rating (order randomized) and a 5-8 s interstimulus interval.</s><s>Conditioning proceeded first in a series of "blocked" trials, in which a given CS/US pair was repeated for five consecutive trials (2 symbols per odor ϫ 4 odors ϫ 5 repeats ϭ 40 blocked trials).</s><s>This was followed by 16 randomly sequenced conditioning trials, in which each CS/US pair was presented twice.</s><s>We then assessed the strength of the CS/US association with 16 "test" trials, in which participants first saw a symbol and then were asked to which odor and which intensity it corresponded.</s><s>If performance was Ͻ90% on the test trials, participants received an additional 16 conditioning trials, followed by another series of test trials.</s><s>Conditioning proceeded in this way until Ͼ90% was achieved in a test session, up to a maximum of four cycles.</s></p><p><s>Day 3: choice task and fMRI scanning.</s><s>Before fMRI scanning, one of the two selected odors was randomly designated as the SA odor and the other odor was designated as NS odor.</s><s>The SA odor was associated with the meal eaten by participants between the presatiety and postsatiety fMRI scanning sessions.</s><s>Each scanning session consisted of five fMRI runs, and each run consisted of 24 randomly sequenced choice trials.</s><s>Each choice trial started with an "offer" phase, which consisted of two CSs simultaneously presented on the screen on either side of a white crosshair for 4 s (left/right position randomized).</s><s>The crosshair then turned green, indicating the onset of the "choice" phase in which participants were free to choose, via mouse click, either of the two CSs.</s><s>After the 3 s choice phase, the center crosshair turned blue, cuing the participant to sniff the odor US paired with the chosen CS.</s><s>After this 2 s "outcome" phase, participants rated either the pleasantness or identity of the odor (rating type randomized), followed by a 0 -4 s interstimulus interval.</s><s>Two-thirds of the choice trials were "high versus low" (HL), such that one of the CSs predicted a high-intensity US and the other predicted a low-intensity US of the same identity.</s><s>The remaining one-third of the trials were "low versus low" (LL), such that both CSs predicted the same low-intensity US.</s></p><p><s>Immediately before each fMRI scanning session, participants provided additional pleasantness ratings for the four odor USs.</s><s>After the presatiety session, participants were removed from the scanner and taken to a separate testing room where they first provided ratings of hunger, desire to eat, fullness, and satiety on visual analog scales.</s><s>They were then presented with a meal consisting of an abundant amount of one food item corresponding as closely as possible to the SA odor (e.g., a large bowl of potato chips if the potato chip odor was designated as SA), as well as water to drink as needed.</s><s>Participants were instructed to eat as much as they wanted, that there was more food than what was presented if they wanted more, and to consider this as a meal rather than a snack.</s><s>They were then left alone and instructed to notify the experimenters when they were done eating.</s><s>After the meal, participants again provided ratings of hunger, desire to eat, fullness, and satiety.</s><s>They were then given an opportunity to use the restroom if needed and were escorted back to the scanner for the postsatiety session, which was identical to the presatiety session except for independent randomization of trial sequences.</s><s>This experimental paradigm is similar to that used in a prior study of reward devaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gottfried et al., 2003)</ref>, except that we used an instrumental choice task instead of a pavlovian task and we focus on anticipatory activity in advance of the receipt of an expected odor reward.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>fMRI data acquisition</head><p><s>MRI data were acquired on the Siemens 3T PRISMA system equipped with a 64-channel head-neck coil.</s><s>Echoplanar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time, 2 s; echo time, 20 ms; flip angle, 90°; slice thickness, 2 mm, no gap; number of slices, 35; interleaved slice acquisition order; matrix size, 110 ϫ 110 voxels; field of view, 220 ϫ 220 mm.</s><s>The functional scanning window was tilted ϳ30°from axial to minimize susceptibility artifacts in OFC.</s><s>Each fMRI run lasted 6.4 min and consisted of 192 EPI volumes covering the ventral part of the PFC, the anterior temporal lobe, and the basal ganglia.</s><s>To aid in normalization of the functional scans, we also acquired 10 EPI volumes for each participant covering the entire brain, with the same parameters as described above except 95 slices and a repetition time of 5.25 s.</s><s>A 1 mm isotropic T1-weighted structural scan was also acquired at the end of the postsatiety scanning session for each participant.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sniff recording and analysis</head><p><s>During scanning, breathing activity was monitored using a respiratory effort band (BIOPAC Systems) affixed around the participant's torso and recorded using PowerLab equipment (ADInstruments) at a sampling rate of 1 kHz.</s><s>Breathing traces for each fMRI run were temporally smoothed using a moving window spanning 500 ms, high-pass filtered (cutoff, 50 s) to remove slow-frequency drifts, and normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD across the entire run trace.</s><s>The onset of inhalation initiated by the choice task sniff cue (center crosshair turning blue) on each choice trial was determined by finding the time of the minimum signal value within a window spanning 1 s on either side of the sniff cue presentation.</s><s>We then calculated trial-by-trial sniff amplitude and volume, which were used as nuisance regressors in statistical modeling of the fMRI data (see below).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>fMRI data preprocessing</head><p><s>To correct for head motion during scanning, for each subject all functional images across presatiety and postsatiety scanning sessions were aligned to the first acquired image using SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm/, RRID: SCR_007037).</s><s>The 10 whole-brain EPIs were motion corrected, averaged, and coregistered to the T1 structural image.</s><s>The functional EPI time series was, using the mean EPI, coregistered to the mean whole-brain EPI.</s><s>Spatial normalization was performed by normalizing the T1-weighted structural image to the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) EPI template volume.</s><s>For multivariate analyses, the resulting deformation fields were applied to brain maps of decoder classification accuracy.</s><s>For the functional connectivity analysis, the deformation fields were applied to the functional EPI volumes.</s><s>In both cases, the resulting normalized volumes were spatially smoothed with a 6 ϫ 6 ϫ 6 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel before group-level statistical testing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multivoxel pattern analysis for reward identity coding</head><p><s>As with our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kahnt et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kahnt et al., , 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Howard et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Howard et al., , 2016))</ref>, we implemented a searchlight-based decoding approach combined with a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to test for information in fMRI activity patterns without potential biases attributable to voxel selection.</s><s>We first specified separate general linear models (GLMs) using the realigned functional images from each fMRI run.</s><s>The GLMs included six event-related regressors of interest specifying the onset of the choice offers for the following conditions: (1) SA HL set I;</s></p><p><s>(2) SA HL set II; (3) SA LL ; (4) NS HL set I; (5) NS HL set II; (6) NS LL .</s><s>We also included event-related regressors locked to the time of choice, the onset of odor presentation, and the onset of the rating.</s><s>Nuisance regressors included the following: trial-by-trial calculations of sniff amplitude and sniff duration, the six motion parameters calculated during realignment, the derivatives of each motion parameter, one regressor for the absolute signal difference between even and odd slices (to account for signal caused by within-scan motion), and the derivative of this signal.</s><s>Additional regressors were included as needed to model individual volumes that exhibited strong head motion.</s></p><p><s>Spatial patterns of parameter estimates corresponding to the offer onset conditions were then subjected to SVM classification using the LIBSVM implementation (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/,</s><s>RRID: SCR_010243).</s><s>To test for brain regions that coded for the specific identity of expected odor rewards while controlling for differences in CS visual features, at each searchlight (sphere with radius of ϳ4 voxels) we trained the classifier to discriminate SA HL and NS HL set I patterns from four of the five runs and tested it on SA HL and NS HL set II patterns from the left out run.</s><s>This procedure was repeated using set II as the training and set I as the test, and with each run in turn left out.</s><s>The average classification accuracy resulting from this procedure was then mapped back to the center voxel of the searchlight sphere.</s><s>Searchlight spheres consisted only of gray matter voxels specified by inclusively masking functional volumes with the tissue probability map provided by SPM, thresholded at 0.2 and inverse normalized to subject-specific native space.</s><s>The classification described above was first conducted in the presatiety data set to identify regions that encoded the identity of the expected food rewards (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Within these regions, we then tested whether the same classification analysis conducted in the postsatiety data set would produce above-chance classification.</s></p><p><s>To test whether codes of SA or NS identity were specifically modulated after satiety, we implemented a cross-session classification analysis (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>For this, the classifier was trained on SA HL and NS HL set I patterns from the presatiety data and tested on set II patterns in two ways:</s></p><p><s>(1) presatiety SA HL and postsatiety NS HL and (2) postsatiety SA HL and presatiety NS HL .</s><s>Classification accuracy can only be above chance in either case if the activity patterns encoding the identity of SA or NS rewards in the presatiety session remain similar in the postsatiety session.</s><s>Accuracies for these analyses were averaged across voxels in the regions identified in the original identity-based decoding analysis and compared between postsatiety SA HL and postsatiety NS HL .</s></p></div>

et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, to our knowledge no human or animal study has tested the effects of vmPFC lesions on behavior in a devaluation task, and it is therefore unclear whether vmPFC is necessary for goal-directed behavior.</s></p><p><s>A fundamental question is how representations of specific rewards are linked with general reward signals in vmPFC to control goal-directed behavior.</s><s>Here we show that functional connectivity between the lateral pOFC and vmPFC was specifically modulated by satiety, indicating that the strength of coupling between these regions reflects the value of the expected outcome.</s><s>Supporting this notion, functional connectivity between these regions was predictive of satiety-related changes in choice behavior.</s><s>These findings are in line with the idea that lateral OFC is associated with specific reward information, whereas vmPFC and anterior cingulate implement value comparisons to guide choice behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rushworth et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our findings support a recent proposal that OFC represents a cognitive map for reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wilson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schuck et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>According to this framework, value is not necessarily a component of OFC representations but is assigned to the represented states via connections to other brain areas.</s><s>Our results extend this idea by suggesting that connectivity to vmPFC is a potential substrate for assigning OFC state representations with value, and by suggesting that devalued goals may be less coherently represented in the OFC state space, and therefore evoke weaker value signals in vmPFC.</s><s>The implication is that by preferentially signaling valued states, the OFC plays a fundamentally affirmative role in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rudebeck and Murray, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous work has suggested that updating of reward associations involves interactions between OFC and amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baxter et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rhodes and Murray, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Zeeb and Winstanley, 2013</ref>).</s><s>Here we did not find specific changes in outcome representations in the amygdala, and functional connectivity between the amygdala and the pOFC was not modulated by sensory-specific satiety.</s><s>This may be explained by differences in study design in that our experiment involved instrumental choices rather than pavlovian responding, which has previously been linked to amygdala activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gottfried et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pre ´vost et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, this may also reflect the fact that amygdala-OFC interactions are important during the satiety phase of devaluation but not afterward during choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Wellman et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We show that identity-specific representations in medial and lateral pOFC undergo distinct satiety-related changes.</s><s>Both of these regions are located in caudal OFC, which has been implicated in food reward identity coding using methods that similarly control for value such as those used here <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Klein-Flu ¨gge et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Given the direct input from olfactory and gustatory sensory cortex into caudal OFC, this region is well positioned to integrate olfactory information into representations of identityspecific food rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carmichael and Price, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rolls, 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>[Note that reward identity signals in posterior OFC contrast with identity-specific value signals in anterior OFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Howard et al., 2015)</ref>, as well as with studies showing that anterior OFC tracks satiety-related changes in reward value <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Small et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gottfried et al., 2003)</ref>, raising the possibility that anterior and posterior OFC differentially contribute to goal-directed behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Murray et al., 2015)</ref>.]</s><s>However, based on human cytoarchitecture, our medial and lateral pOFC clusters lie in distinct locations corresponding to regions Fo2 and Fo3, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Henssen et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In terms of anatomical connectivity, primate tracing studies have identified a "medial" network associated with limbic and visceromotor functions and an "orbital" network involved in sensory integration and association <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carmichael and Price, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>Given the close homology between primate and human OFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mackey and Petrides, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wallis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neubert et al., 2015)</ref>, our medial pOFC cluster likely lies in the medial network, whereas the lateral pOFC cluster lies at the intersection between the two networks.</s><s>Access to both sensory and limbic substrates may therefore enable lateral pOFC to differentially update specific reward representations.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to lateral pOFC, the medial pOFC exhibited a nonspecific change after satiety.</s><s>Such uniform changes may be related to hunger level and could be implemented by dopaminergic signaling.</s><s>Indeed, fMRI signals in posteromedial pOFC have been shown to correlate with midbrain activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kahnt et al., 2012)</ref> in a dopamine-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kahnt and Tobler, 2017)</ref>, and midbrain-derived dopamine levels are reduced after feeding in the rodent VS and medial prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn and Phillips, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roitman et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">de Araujo et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Although speculative, this may indicate that nonspecific changes in medial pOFC depend on satiety-induced changes in dopamine, which may ultimately result in altered representations for both food odors.</s><s>This nonspecific, homeostatic system could operate in parallel with the goal-directed pathway in lateral pOFC/vmPFC.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our results suggest that representations of specific rewards in medial and lateral pOFC undergo differential devaluation-related changes.</s><s>In addition, they provide novel evidence for a mechanism by which these outcomespecific substrates are functionally connected to vmPFC to support adaptive choice behavior.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
