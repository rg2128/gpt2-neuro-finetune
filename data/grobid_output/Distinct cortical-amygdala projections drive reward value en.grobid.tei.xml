<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Prospective consideration of the outcomes of potential action choices is crucial to adaptive decision making.</s><s>Chief among these considerations is the value of the anticipated rewarding events.</s><s>This incentive information is state-dependent; e.g., a food outcome is more valuable when hungry than when sated.</s><s>It is also learned; the value of a specific reward is encoded during its experience in a relevant motivational state <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Retrieval of the previously-encoded value of an anticipated reward allows adaptive reward pursuit decisions.</s><s>Dysfunction in either the value encoding or retrieval process will lead to aberrant reward pursuit and illinformed decision making-cognitive symptoms that characterize myriad psychiatric diseases.</s><s>Despite importance to understanding adaptive and maladaptive behavior, little is known of the neural circuits that support the encoding and retrieval of state-dependent reward value memories.</s></p><p><s>The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has long been known to mediate emotional learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Accordingly, this structure is necessary for reward value encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</s><s>But little is known of the circuitry supporting the BLA in this function.</s><s>Whether the BLA participates in retrieving reward value is less clear and has been disputed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and its contribution, if any, to active decision making is uncertain.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>BLA glutamate release tracks reward value encoding and retrieval.</s></p><p><s>The BLA has intrinsic glutamatergic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and is densely innervated by glutamatergic projections from regions themselves implicated in reward learning and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Thus, we sought to begin to fill these gaps in knowledge by using electroenzymatic biosensors to characterize BLA glutamate release during reward value encoding and retrieval (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-b</ref>).</s><s>These biosensors allow sub-second, spatially-precise, sensitive, and selective measurement of neuronally-released glutamate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>We used a behavioral paradigm that allowed us to experimentally isolate reward value encoding from the retrieval of that value and from confounding reinforcement processes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Rats were trained while relatively sated (4-hr food deprived) on a self-paced, 2-lever action sequence to earn sucrose wherein pressing a 'seeking' lever introduced a 'taking' lever, a press on which retracted this lever and triggered sucrose delivery.</s><s>In the sated state, the sucrose has a low value and supports a low rate of lever pressing.</s><s>Once baseline performance was stable, rats were re-exposed to the sucrose in either the familiar sated state or in a hungry (20-hr food-deprived) state.</s><s>Because rats had never before experienced the sucrose while hungry, the latter provided an incentive learning opportunity to encode the high value of the sucrose in the hungry state.</s><s>Re-exposure was non-contingent and conducted 'offline' (i.e., without the levers present) to isolate reward value encoding from reinforcement-related confounds and to prevent caching of value to the seeking and taking actions themselves.</s><s>The effect of this incentive learning opportunity on rats' reward pursuit was then tested the following day in a brief lever-pressing probe test.</s><s>No rewards were delivered during this test to force the retrieval of reward value from memory and to avoid online incentive learning.</s><s>Seeking presses were the primary measure because they have been shown to be selectively sensitive to learned changes in the value of an anticipated reward and relatively immune to more general motivational processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>All rats were hungry for this test, but only those rats that had previously experienced the sucrose in the hungry state escalated their reward-seeking actions (Figs.</s><s>1c, S2; t 10 =2.50, p=0.03).</s><s>This result is consistent with the interpretation that the rats retrieved from memory the encoded higher value of the anticipated sucrose reward and used this information to increase their reward pursuit vigor.</s></p><p><s>BLA glutamate release was found to track reward value encoding.</s><s>During re-exposure, sucrose consumption triggered a transient increase in BLA glutamate concentration, but only if a new value was being encoded (i.e., re-exposure hungry; Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d-e, S3</ref>; Time: F 2,20 =5.04, P=0.02; Deprivation: F 1,10 =6.67, P=0.03;</s><s>Time x Deprivation: F 2,20 =4.99, P=0.02; see also Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>This response was largest early in re-exposure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>), when incentive learning is the greatest.</s><s>There was no BLA glutamate response detectable by the biosensor to sucrose in the absence of incentive learning either in the familiar sated state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d-e</ref>) or in a familiar hungry state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>BLA glutamate release was also found to track reward value retrieval.</s><s>In the subsequent lever-pressing test, BLA glutamate transients preceded the initiation of bouts (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) of reward-seeking presses, but only if rats had prior experience with the sucrose in the hungry state and could, therefore, retrieve its current value to guide their reward pursuit actions (Figs.</s><s>1f-g, S6; Time: F 2,20 =1.87, P=0.18; Deprivation: F 1,10 =3.90, P=0.08;</s><s>Time x Deprivation: F 2,20 =4.31, P=0.03).</s><s>BLA glutamate transients selectively preceded the initiation of reward-seeking activity and did not occur prior to subsequent lever presses within a bout (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3d,</ref><ref type="figure">S6</ref>), suggesting these signals might relate to the considerations driving reward pursuit.</s><s>This was further supported by evidence that the magnitude of prebout-initiation BLA glutamate release positively correlated on a trial x trial basis with the number of seeking presses in and duration of the subsequent bout (presses: r 88 =0.23, p=0.03, duration: r 88 =0.21, p=0.05); longer bouts of reward seeking were preceded by larger amplitude glutamate transients.</s><s>In the group that received incentive learning, glutamate release magnitude significantly predicted future reward-seeking activity in the seconds prior to, but not following the initiation of reward seeking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLA glutamate receptor activity is necessary for reward value encoding and retrieval.</head><p><s>We next assessed whether BLA glutamate activity is necessary for the encoding and/or retrieval of reward value by blocking BLA glutamate receptors during either sucrose reexposure (encoding) or during the post-re-exposure lever-pressing test (retrieval) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Following training in the sated state, all rats were provided the incentive learning opportunity (sucrose re-exposure hungry; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Inactivation of neither NMDA, with ifenprodil <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , nor AMPA, with NBQX <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , receptors in the BLA altered food-port checking behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>; F 2,23 =0.81, P=0.46) or sucrose palatability responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>; F 2,21 =0.12, P=0.88) during re-exposure.</s><s>Inactivation of BLA NMDA, but not AMPA receptors did, however, prevent the subsequent upshift in reward seeking that would have otherwise occurred when animals were tested in the hungry state drug-free the next day (Figs.</s><s>2e, S7; F 2,23 =4.48, P=0.03), indicating that BLA NMDA receptors are necessary for assigning positive value to a reward.</s><s>All rats were then given the incentive learning opportunity drugfree, and were tested again for their lever pressing in the hungry state on drug (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>In this case, either BLA AMPA or NMDA receptor inactivation prevented the increase in valueguided reward seeking that should have occurred following incentive learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>, S8;

see also Fig. <ref type="figure">S9c-d</ref>).</s><s>Clozapine N-oxide (CNO; 1mM/0.5µl)</s><s>was infused into the BLA to inactivate these terminals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> during the sucrose re-exposure incentive learning opportunity and lever pressing was assessed the following day drug-free (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Neither manipulation altered food-port checking behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>; F 2,26 =0.54, P=0.59) or sucrose palatability responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>; F 2,26 =1.33, P=0.28) online during the re-exposure.</s><s>Inhibition of lOFC, but not mOFC terminals in the BLA did, however, prevent the subsequent upshift in reward seeking that would have otherwise occurred (Figs. 3f, S11; F 2,26 =5.06, P=0.014).</s><s>These data suggest that activity in lOFCBLA, but not mOFC→BLA projections is necessary for encoding the positive value of a rewarding event.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether OFC→BLA projections are necessary for reward value retrieval, we allowed all the rats to encode the sucrose's high value in the hungry state drug-free and then evaluated their lever pressing in the hungry state following intra-BLA vehicle or CNO infusion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>).</s><s>In this case, inhibition of mOFC, but not lOFC terminals in the BLA attenuated reward-seeking activity (Figs.</s><s>3h, S12; F 2,25 =9.81, P=0.0007), without altering performance of other indices of motivated behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12</ref>).</s><s>Inactivation of mOFC→BLA projections was without effect if reward value was not being retrieved from memory, either because it had not been learned or because it was observable to the subject and could, therefore, be held in working memory at test (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate the necessity of activity in mOFC→BLA, but not lOFC→BLA projections in retrieving the value of an anticipated reward.</s><s>Thus, lOFC→BLA projections are necessary for encoding reward value, but their activity is not necessary to retrieve this information.</s><s>Whereas mOFC→BLA projections are not necessary for encoding reward value, but are required to retrieve this information to guide reward pursuit.</s><s>Secondarily, this double dissociation indicates the behavioral effects are not due to off-target effects of CNO itself in the absence of hM4D(Gi), which would cause uniform behavioral effects regardless of hM4D(Gi) subregion.</s></p><p><s>Optical stimulation of lOFC→BLA, but not mOFC→BLA projections is sufficient to instantiate value to a specific reward.</s></p><p><s>That lOFC→BLA projections were necessary for positive reward value encoding, suggests that activity in these projections might drive such encoding.</s><s>To test this, we optically stimulated lOFC terminals in the BLA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>) concurrent with sucrose experience under conditions in which incentive learning would not normally occur: a familiar sated state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>In a separate group, we stimulated mOFC terminals in the BLA.</s><s>We restricted optical stimulation (473 nm, 20 Hz, 10 mW, 5 s) to the time of sucrose consumption during noncontingent exposure to match the timing of BLA glutamate release detected during incentive learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Rats expressing the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in excitatory cells of either the lOFC or mOFC showed robust expression in terminals in the BLA in the vicinity of implanted optical fibers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b-c</ref>; see also Fig. <ref type="figure">S9e-f</ref>).</s><s>Stimulation of lOFC terminals in the BLA concurrent with reward consumption in the familiar sated state did not alter food-port checking behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>; t 16 =0.20,</s><s>p=0.84) or sucrose palatability responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>; t 16 =0.25,</s><s>p=0.80) online.</s><s>But it did cause a dramatic increase in reward-seeking presses in the test conducted in that same sated state manipulation-free the following day (Figs.</s><s>4f, S14; F 2,24 =9.25, P=0.001), mimicking the effect of hunger-induced incentive learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S15</ref>).</s><s>This did not occur under otherwise identical circumstances with stimulation paired with a task-irrelevant rewarding event (food pellet), ruling out the confounding possibility of enhanced context salience or other factors unrelated to motivation to obtain the specific anticipated sucrose reward (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>).</s><s>lOFC→BLA stimulation also amplified normal, hunger-induced incentive learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S15</ref>).</s><s>Identical stimulation of mOFC terminals in the BLA had no effect on online food-port checking behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>; t 10 =0.49, p=0.64) or sucrose palatability responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>; t 10 =0.07, p=0.95), or on subsequent reward-seeking presses (Figs.</s><s>4f, S14; t 10 =1.17, p=0.27).</s><s>Thus, activity in lOFC→BLA, but not mOFC→BLA projections is sufficient to instantiate value to a rewarding event, and, thereby, drive escalation of its pursuit.</s></p><p><s>Optical stimulation of mOFC→BLA, but not lOFC→BLA projections is sufficient to facilitate reward value retrieval.</s></p><p><s>That mOFC→BLA projections were necessary for reward value retrieval suggests their activity might facilitate the retrieval of the value of an anticipated reward.</s><s>If this is true, then optically stimulating mOFC→BLA projections during lever pressing should enhance reward seeking following an incentive learning opportunity that would not itself support an upshift in reward pursuit.</s><s>To test this, we expressed ChR2 in the mOFC and, following sucrose reexposure in a moderate, 8-hr food-deprived hunger state, optically stimulated mOFC terminals in the BLA during a lever-pressing test conducted in that same 8-hr moderate hunger state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a-c</ref>).</s><s>A separate group received stimulation of lOFC terminals in the BLA.</s><s>In controls, sucrose exposure in the 8-hr food-deprived state was not sufficient to drive increased reward pursuit when tested in this state the following day, confirming subthreshold incentive learning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5d</ref>).</s><s>Stimulation of mOFC terminals in the BLA (473 nm, 20Hz, 10mW, 3 s, once/min) promoted reward-seeking activity under these conditions (Figs. 5d, S16; t 15 =3.62, p=0.003).</s><s>Stimulation did not increase reward seeking when tested in the well-learned low-value sated state, or following effective incentive learning in the high-value hungry state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S17</ref>).</s><s>mOFC→BLA stimulation was also without effect under otherwise identical circumstances in the absence of the subthreshold incentive learning opportunity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5e-f</ref>, S18; t 8 =0.67, p=0.52), isolating its effect to reward value retrieval.</s><s>Stimulation of lOFC→BLA projections during the reward-seeking test had no effect (Figs. 5d, S16; t 11 =0.737, p=0.72).</s><s>These data indicate that activity in mOFC→BLA, but not lOFC→BLA projections is sufficient to facilitate the retrieval of a state-dependent reward value.</s><s>Thus, while it is plausible that optical stimulation of OFC terminals could result in antidromic stimulation of OFC cells that collateralize to cortical or other subcortical targets, these data converge with the chemogenetic terminal inactivation (for which antidromic effects have not been reported) data to indicate that reward value encoding and retrieval are mediated by lOFC→BLA and mOFC→BLA projections, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>These data provide evidence for the BLA as a crucial locus for not only learning about the value of a rewarding event, but also for retrieving this information to guide adaptive reward pursuit, revealing it as a critical contributor to value-based decision making.</s><s>These value encoding and retrieval functions were found to be supported via doubly dissociable contributions of excitatory input from the lOFC and mOFC.</s><s>Whereas lOFC→BLA projection activity is necessary for and sufficient to drive encoding of a reward's positive value, it does not mediate the retrieval of that state-dependent reward value memory.</s><s>Conversely, activity in mOFC→BLA projections does not mediate reward value encoding, but
