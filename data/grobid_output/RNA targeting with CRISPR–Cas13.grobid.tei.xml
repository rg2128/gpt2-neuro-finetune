<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>inactive LwaCas13a maintains targeted RNA binding, allowing for programmable tracking of transcripts in live cells.</s><s>Our results establish CRISPR-Cas13a as a flexible platform for RNA targeting with wide applicability for studying RNA in mammalian cells.</s></p><p><s>Previous work has shown that Cas orthologs exhibit varying degrees of activity in bacterial and mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>We therefore evaluated fifteen Cas13a orthologs for PFS preference and activity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) using a previously described ampicillin resistance bacterial assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>Cas13a-mediated cleavage of the ÃŸ-lactamase (ampicillin resistance) transcript results in bacterial death under ampicillin selection, which can be measured by quantifying surviving colonies.</s><s>Using this approach, we found that the Cas13a ortholog from L.wadei (LwaCas13a) was most active, followed by the previously characterized LshCas13a (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Next generation sequencing analysis of the PFS distributions from LwaCas13a and LshCas13a screens revealed that most LwaCas13a PFS sequences were depleted (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c-e</ref>), suggesting robust LwaCas13a RNA cleavage activity.</s><s>Indeed, motif analysis of the depleted PFS sequences at varying thresholds revealed the expected 3â€² H motif of LshCas13a, but no significant PFS motif for LwaCas13a (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with these results, LwaCas13a was also found to be more active than LshCas13a in our recent work developing a nucleic acid sensor and exhibited a weak 3â€² H PFS when biochemically characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Because of its high activity and lack of PFS in bacteria, we focused on LwaCas13a for further development.</s></p><p><s>In vitro cleavage reactions with LwaCas13a demonstrated programmable RNA cleavage with a crRNA encoding a 28 nt spacer, shorter than the 29-30 nt length found in the native L. wadei CRISPR array,(Extended Data Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), confirmed the dramatically higher cleavage efficiency of LwaCas13a over LshCas13a (Extended Data Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b-c</ref>), and exhibited similar biochemical characteristics for the two enzymes (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d-g</ref> and Supplementary Note 1).</s><s>We found that LwaCas13a could cleave the corresponding pre-crRNA transcript from L. wadei (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h</ref>).</s><s>We also explored the crRNA constraints on LwaCas13a cleavage by truncating the spacer and found that LwaCas13a retained in vitro cleavage activity with spacer lengths as short as 20 nt (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2i</ref>).</s><s>Although guide lengths less than 20 nt no longer display catalytic activity, the LwaCas13-crRNA complex may still retain binding activity, providing an opportunity for orthogonal applications with a single catalytic enzyme <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We next evaluated the ability of LwaCas13a to cleave transcripts in mammalian cells.</s><s>We cloned mammalian codon-optimized LwaCas13a into mammalian expression vectors with msfGFP fusions on the C-or N-terminus and either a dual-flanking nuclear export sequence (NES) or nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and evaluated expression and localization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>).</s><s>We found that msfGFP-fused LwaCas13a constructs expressed well and localized effectively to the cytoplasm or nucleus according to the localization sequence.</s><s>To evaluate the in vivo cleavage activity of LwaCas13a we developed a dual luciferase reporter system, which expresses both Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) and Cypridinia luciferase (Cluc) under different promoters on the same vector, allowing one transcript to serve as the Cas13a target and the other to serve as a dosing control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>).</s><s>We then designed guides against Gluc and cloned them into a tRNA Val -promoter-expressing guide vector.</s><s>We transfected the LwaCas13a expression vector, guide vector, and dual-luciferase construct into HEK293FT cells and measured luciferase activity at 48 hours post-transfection.</s><s>We found that nuclearlocalized LwaCas13a-msfGFP resulted in the highest levels of knockdown (75.7% for guide 1, 72.9% for guide 2), comparable to position-matched shRNA controls (78.3% for guide 1, 51.5% for guide 2) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f</ref>), which control for accessibility and sequence in the target region.</s><s>Because of the superior cleavage of the LwaCas13a-msfGFP-NLS construct, we used this design for all further knockdown experiments.</s><s>We also find that LwaCas13a yields greatest Gluc knockdown with a spacer length of 28 nt (73.8%) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>), that knockdown is
