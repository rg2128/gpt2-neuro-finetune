<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive.</s><s>Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and is a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex.</s><s>We find three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia.</s><s>Functional analysis reveals different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors.</s><s>Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons.</s><s>Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism, and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia.</s><s>Thus, the emergence of human-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger human neocortex accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorders.</s></p></div>
