<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral variability in decision making with unfamiliar sensory cues</head><p><s>Our hypothesis is that individual differences in ambiguous choice responses partly emerge from neural dynamics formed in MFC through previous experiences.</s><s>We examined this hypothesis in a sensory-guided alternative choice task.</s><s>Rats were trained to make either Left or Right licking in response to high-frequency <ref type="bibr">(13 kHz)</ref> or low-frequency (10 kHz) auditory cues (called familiar cues), respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Each cue was presented for 200 ms, and correct choices after the cue presentation were rewarded.</s><s>Among 36 trained rats, 21 rats reached a criterion correct rate (75 %), and multi-neuron recordings were performed from MFC of these rats.</s><s>During the recordings, the rats were exposed to unfamiliar cue tones (10.5 to 12.5 kHz) in 20% of trials besides the familiar tones.</s><s>Because these tones were unfamiliar to the rats, their choice responses were ambiguous and probabilistic.</s><s>Finally, eight rats yielded sufficiently many neurons for the present analysis.</s><s>Further experimental details are found in Methods.</s><s>This experiment revealed an interesting feature of decision-making in unfamiliar situations: The choice behavior of the rats showed large differences across the rats.</s></p><p><s>The choice probability of Left licking generally increased with the tone frequency in all rats, but psychometric curves for unfamiliar cues exhibited large individual differences (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1B</ref>).</s><s>Some rats varied choice probability sensitively to the frequency of unfamiliar cues (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1C2</ref>), but other rats made biased or chance-level choices irrespective of the tone frequency (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1C1</ref>).</s><s>Throughout this study, we quantified the individual differences in psychometric curves by fitting these curves with a nonlinear function P L (Methods).</s><s>Choice probabilities are inevitably deflected by sampled data.</s><s>Therefore, we examined the stability of parameter fitting as follows.</s><s>We resampled a different set of 30 trials out of the entire data set (comprising several tens of unfamiliar trials and several hundreds of familiar trials) for each tone and rat.</s><s>This allows us to generate a psychometric curve per rat.</s><s>Then, for each rat we repeated this procedure 30 times to generate 30 samples of psychometric curves and to collect the corresponding 30 values of sensitivity S. We plotted these values in an increasing order of the original sensitivity of the rats (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1D</ref>).</s><s>Though the variance was large in some rats, the average values of S monotonically increased while preserving the serial order of S, indicating that the sensitivity adequately characterizes the behavioral tendency of each rat irrespective of data sampling.</s><s>We further confirmed the stability of our fitting scheme by choosing a different fitting function (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S1</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural trajectories formed in MFC and the reservoir</head><p><s>We have shown that the network models produce the divergent psychometric curves that are consistent with those observed in experiment.</s><s>However, whether neural activities in the reservoir and in the MFC are also similar has yet to be clarified.</s><s>To this end, we first studied the time evolution of neural activities.</s><s>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref> compare neural activities averaged over familiar trials between in MFC and in the reservoir under given cue and choice conditions.</s><s>Both experimental and modeled neural activities exhibited distinct trajectories when neurons were sorted according to their times of peak firing rates in correct trials for given stimulus.</s><s>However, neural activities sorted in the peak-time orders observed in different stimulus conditions showed no clear trajectories.</s><s>These results demonstrate that the neural trajectories are choice-specific in both MFC and the reservoir.</s></p><p><s>We analyzed the principal components (PC) of population neural responses in MFC and the reservoir in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>, respectively.</s><s>In MFC, decision making with familiar cues formed neural trajectories selective to stimulus and choice.</s><s>Note that the first principal component (PC1) represented a frequency-nonselective component of auditory responses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>) and hence is not shown here.</s><s>In the reservoir, similar condition-selective trajectories are formed except that PC1 and PC2 in the former corresponded to PC2 and PC3 in the latter, respectively.</s></p><p><s>Frequency-nonspecific stimulus-evoked responses (PC1 in the experiment) were almost missing in our models.</s></p><p><s>We then investigated how these familiar trajectories lead to correct choice responses in MFC and the reservoir networks.</s><s>As PCA does not identify task-relevant axes, we applied a linear regression method <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mante et al., 2013</ref> and Methods) to trial-averaged neural activities for given combination of stimulus and choice, and identified two axes: the stimulus axis explains the maximal difference in trajectories between FH and FL while the choice axis reveals the maximal difference between Left and Right choices.</s><s>In both rats (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref>) and models (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3F</ref>), familiar trajectories projected onto the stimulus axis or the choice axis started to separate into correct choices almost simultaneously with cue onset.</s><s>These results suggest that the integration of sensory evidence occurs during the cue presentation in both MFC and the reservoir.</s></p><p><s>The familiar trajectories also revealed interesting differences between the computational models and rats.</s><s>First, the trajectory separation along the stimulus axis was generally smaller in the rats compared to the models.</s><s>Though the cause of this discrepancy is not entirely clear, it was partly due to that the number of tone-selective MFC neurons was small and difference in their responses to different tones were also weak (at most several spikes per second in average).</s><s>Second, trajectory separation along the choice axis stopped in the rats after the termination of sensory cues, whereas the separation continued to grow in the models presumably due to positive feedback from readout neurons.</s><s>It was previously shown in the rat MFC that trajectories reach an almost maximal separation just prior to cue termination <ref type="bibr">(Handa et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The gamma-band power of the local field potentials also abruptly increased in MFC, indicating that some internal event, for instance the formation and transmission of a preparatory signal for choice response, might occur at this timing.</s><s>Such an internal process was not modeled here, which might cause the discrepancy between rats and models.</s><s>Except for these differences, our computational model well reproduced neural dynamics in the rat MFC.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural dynamics in MFC and reservoir predicts choice behaviors</head><p><s>To confirm the importance of neural trajectories for choice behavior, we examined whether neural trajectories in MFC and our model have sufficient information about consequent choice responses.</s><s>We predicted a probable choice from neural trajectories by using Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) with a hyperplane that optimally divides the population activity patterns corresponding to Left and Right choices (Methods).</s><s>The optimal hyperplane was determined from neural ensembles at the time of choice response for familiar trials, and we denote its normal vector as W opt .</s><s>In our model, if the readout neurons can discriminate optimally between Left-and Right-choice familiar trajectories, the normalized weight vector of readout connections should be close to W opt .</s><s>However, the two vectors cannot be exactly the same because the readout neurons are not passive linear filters but are active nonlinear filters performing temporal integration of inputs under mutual inhibition.</s></p><p><s>Averaged familiar trajectories projected onto W opt are shown for the rats (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>) and models (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>) for different cue and choice conditions.</s><s>The projected trajectories linking given sensory cue to different choices were distinctive in both rats and models.</s><s>Importantly, W opt obtained from familiar cues was also valid for discriminating between Left-and Right-choice trajectories evoked by unfamiliar cues.</s><s>This means that unfamiliar trajectories converge at similar locations at which familiar trajectories also converge.</s><s>We computed the distributions of projected activities in a rat (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4C1</ref>) and a model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C2</ref>) at the choice time points of Left-choice and Right-choice trials.</s><s>In the rats, the activity distributions for different choices have small overlaps corresponding to incorrect choices.</s><s>To infer trial-by-trial choice responses from the projected neural activity, we adopted a naive criterion boundary given as the mid-point of the means of Left-and Right-choice distributions.</s><s>Then, Left-choice probability is predicted to be the area of the distribution lying on the left side of this boundary, and so on.</s><s>On average about 75 % of neural trajectories in MFC were discriminable by this criterion, although the discriminability fluctuated across rats (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4D</ref>).</s><s>In the models, choice responses were correctly inferred in about 90 % of the trials, and fluctuations in the discriminability were small (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4E</ref>).</s><s>Thus, neural trajectories in MFC and the reservoir determine choice responses on a single-trail basis.</s><s>This is expected in the model as it was trained as such, but the finding is non-trivial in the rat MFC.</s></p><p><s>However, the linear discrimination analysis was insufficient for predicting individual differences in choice responses across different rats and different models.</s></p><p><s>We did not find significant correlations between the sensitivity to stimuli and the discriminability of neural trajectories in both rats (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4F</ref>, p=0.86) and models (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4G</ref>, p=0.82) although this could be partly due to small data size in the case of rats.</s><s>These results suggest that the significantly different behavioral characteristics are not mere reflections of neural states at the choice point.</s><s>Therefore, we investigate how neural population dynamics preceding the choice point determines the behavioral characteristics.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Susceptibility of neural dynamics influences behavioral characteristics</head><p><s>Decision making in our model depends on the interplay between its internal dynamics and sensory input.</s><s>Therefore, we expected that different characteristics of internal dynamics result in different behavioral characteristics.</s><s>To characterize internal dynamics, we applied a perturbative input to networks receiving no sensory stimuli.</s></p><p><s>The perturbative input was applied 30 times to each network at the identical neural state (perturbed state) to which sensory stimuli were applied in the previous simulations, and the Euclidian distances (susceptibility χ) among the perturbed trajectories and a non-perturbed trajectory were measured at 300 ms after the perturbation.</s><s>The time of measurement did not change the essential results.</s><s>Note that χ is defined for every different state in the neural state space (Methods).</s><s>Perturbed neural trajectories evolving from a state with high χ may diverge broadly, while those trajectories from a state with low χ may hardly diverge.</s></p><p><s>We first show neural responses of a sensitive network and an insensitive network, respectively.</s><s>For a particular state in the sensitive network, unfamiliar stimuli U1, U2 and U3 (close to FH) evoked trajectories evolving into Left choice, whereas those evoked by U4 and U5 (close to FL) evolved into Right choice, implying that the similarity of unfamiliar stimuli to familiar stimuli determined choice responses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5A1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, all unfamiliar trajectories resulted in Left choice for another state in the insensitive network, implying that internal dynamics governed the choice responses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A2</ref>).</s><s>We then show how perturbed and non-perturbed trajectories evolve in these networks from the same initial states.</s><s>In the sensitive network, perturbed trajectories diverged broadly, implying that a weak perturbation tends to give high χ values (0.014, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5B1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the insensitive network generally yielded more localized perturbed trajectories and hence low χ values (0.0045, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B2</ref>).</s><s>Thus, networks with high susceptibility responded differently to different unfamiliar stimuli, whereas those with low susceptibility responded similarly to different stimuli.</s></p><p><s>We then examined a quantitative relationship between the susceptibility and responses to the seven stimuli (FL, U1, …, U5, FH).</s><s>To this end, we define the response bias as |#Left -7/2| for each perturbed state, where #Left is the number of Left choices resulting from each perturbed state in response to the seven stimuli.</s><s>The response bias is 0.5 if three or four of seven choices are Left (weak biases), while it is 3.5 if all choices are only Left or Right (strong biases).</s><s>Both in a sensitive (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5C1</ref>) and an insensitive successful learner (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C2</ref>), the response bias is significantly and negatively correlated with the value of χ (p&lt;10 -5 for the sensitive and p&lt;10 -6 for the insensitive).</s><s>We quantified the susceptibility of each model network by averaging the values of χ over randomly chosen 50 perturbed states.</s><s>A network with a sensitive psychometric curve yielded a distribution biased towards higher values of χ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5C1</ref>), whereas a network with an insensitive psychometric curve yielded a distribution biased towards lower values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C2</ref>).</s><s>We plotted the sensitivity values of 20 successful learners against their average χ values to find a significant positive correlation (p&lt;0.004) between the sensitivity (behavioral metric) and susceptibility (neural metric) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5D</ref>).</s><s>These results are summarized as the following intuitive picture of the neural mechanism of individual differences: higher susceptibility implies a shallower landscape around the trajectory and produces a sensitive
