 and in an equivalent manner in both cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows Q LEDon Q LEDoff in each pair), indicating that reduced CC was not due to unequal light effects.</s><s>Hence, synchronized ongoing activity in cortical neurons, within and across different thalamic recipient layers, depends on recurrent cortical activity and does not reflect the correlation between the cell's feedforward thalamic inputs.</s><s>Cortical noise correlation is unrelated to thalamic inputs.</s><s>We next examined the cortical and thalamic contributions to trial-totrial variability of whisker-evoked EPSCs of L4 cells.</s><s>In the visual system, inactivation of cortical firing had a negligible effect on trial-to-trial membrane potential variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , suggesting that cortical variability is dominated by thalamic inputs.</s><s>In contrast, we found that in the barrel cortex, optogenetic silencing of local firing profoundly reduced the variability of the whisker-evoked EPSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a-c</ref>).</s><s>This was evident both in the standard deviation and in the coefficient of variation (CV).</s><s>On average, the standard deviation of peak EPSPs (excitatory postsynaptic potentials) was reduced by 62%±22% following cortical silencing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>, P ¼ 0.0003, n ¼ 17, z ¼ À 3.6, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).</s><s>This trend remained even after normalization by the mean (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>, reduction of 14% ± 29% in CV,</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P ¼ 0.029, n ¼ 17, z ¼ À 2.2, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).</formula><p><s>The larger trial-to-trial variability of intact cortex compared with inactivated cortex suggests that it is strongly influenced by recurrent cortical circuits.</s><s>Therefore, we examined the cortical and thalamic origins of the sensory-evoked excitatory trial-to-trial correlation (TTC EE , noise correlation) between pairs of cells that received direct thalamic inputs.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref> shows two representative pairs in which 10 sequential whisker-evoked responses of one cell (orange traces) are sorted from the smallest to the largest, with the corresponding responses of the second cell (blue traces) during LED OFF (left) and LED ON (right) conditions (for illustration purposes, traces of the cell with the larger responses, on average, was placed below the second cell).</s><s>Across the population, the change in TTC EE for the recorded pairs was not consistent between the two conditions.</s><s>In five pairs, TTC EE was reduced; in three, it roughly remained the same; and in two pairs, it was increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4e</ref>).</s><s>No significant difference was found between the mean TTC EE values.</s><s>For the seven L4-L4 pairs, the TTC EE dropped from 0.38 ± 0.14 to 0.16 ± 0.09 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4e</ref>, dark blue circles, z ¼ À 1.0142, P ¼ 0.219, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and for four L4-L5 pairs, it changed from 0.16 ± 0.05 to 0.29 ± 0.06 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4e</ref>, light blue circles P ¼ 0.375, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).</s><s>Notably, except for one pair (L4-L5), the TTC EE values for the two conditions were significantly different for all the pairs (bootstrap analysis of TTC EE , see the 'Methods' section).</s><s>Moreover, as the lines connecting the two conditions crossed each other, the TTC EE during LED OFF condition could not be predicted from the one measured during cortical silencing; that is, the distributions across the conditions were not correlated with each other (r 2 ¼ 0.07, P ¼ 0.557 and r 2 ¼ 0.16, P ¼ 0.596 for L4-L4 and L4-L5 pairs, respectively).</s><s>Furthermore, noise correlation when cortex was intact, or during silencing, was not related to the ongoing correlations under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</s><s>Thus, similar to ongoing activity, we can conclude that the TTC EE of sensory response between cortical cells is not determined by direct thalamic inputs but rather depends on recurrent cortical activity.</s></p><p><s>Origins of correlated cortical activities in awake animals.</s><s>Both ongoing and evoked activities in the cortical cells are regulated by animal behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we wished to confirm our result in awake mice.</s><s>Naive animals were head-fixed, and  were not trained to perform a task.</s><s>Similar to our recordings in anaesthetized animals, surface illumination of the cortex activated GABAergic cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>, example cell and population data below, 1.3±0.7 versus 47±16 Hz for LED OFF and LED ON;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this work, we investigated the role of thalamic inputs in shaping the synaptic correlations between neighbouring cells in thalamic recipient cortical layers during ongoing and sensoryevoked activities.</s><s>To address this question, we optogenetically silenced cortical firing in anaesthetized and awake mice to isolate the thalamic excitatory inputs of intracellularly recorded cells in L4 and L5.</s><s>Specifically, in awake mice, we examined the effect of silencing cortical firing on the correlation between excitatory inputs of individually recorded cortical cells and a nearby LFP signal, whereas in anaesthetized mice, we simultaneously recorded the excitatory inputs of nearby pairs of neurons.</s><s>Our results show that synchronized activity during ongoing activity emerges from intracortical inputs, rather than being driven by direct thalamic inputs.</s><s>Trial-to-trial sensory-evoked correlation ('noise correlation') in response to vibrissa stimulation during intact cortical firing is poorly related to the noise correlation in the thalamic inputs, indicating that it is also product of intracortical recurrent activity.</s></p><p><s>To isolate the thalamic input cortical cells, we illuminated the barrel cortex of transgentic mice expressing ChR2 in GAD þ cells while recording excitatory currents.</s><s>A similar approach was used in recent studies of the auditory and visual cortices of anaesthetized mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> where ChR2 was expressed in PV þ cells.</s></p><p><s>Owing to the high level of expression in these transgenic mice, it is reasonable to assume that neurons that did not exhibit direct activation by light are excitatory cells.</s><s>In anaesthetized mice, we found that thalamic inputs contributed on average about 46% of the total excitatory input of layer 4 cells, which is slightly higher than previously reported in the visual cortex (B30%; ref. 38) and roughly the same as in the auditory cortex of mice (41%; ref. 40).</s><s>Our estimate is slightly lower than in the rat auditory cortex where cortical firing was pharmacologically silenced (61%; ref. 49).</s><s>The higher contribution of thalamic inputs to the total response of L4 neurons in the barrel cortex, compared with the visual cortex, may reflect the stronger damping of recurrent cortical activity owing to the prominent feedforward inhibition in the somatosensory <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> and auditory 20 cortices.</s><s>Thus, across different modalities, recurrent cortical circuits may amplify thalamic inputs in a slightly different manner.</s><s>Bruno and Sakmann 37 suggested, however, that cortical amplification is not required to explain the sensory response of L4 cells in the barrel cortex.</s><s>In a few cells, we indeed observed almost no amplification (thalamic contribution B100%), but for most cells, amplification was prominent.</s><s>It is possible that this discrepancy reflects differences across species (mice in our study and rats in ref. 37).</s></p><p><s>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first that compared the amplification of thalamic inputs by recurrent cortical circuits across anaesthetized and awake mice.</s><s>In both conditions, the contribution of thalamic input to the total excitatory input varied with the recording depth.</s><s>Higher contribution of thalamic input was found in cells that were recorded in L4 compared with L5 cells.</s><s>The higher contribution of thalamic inputs in L4 is expected from the dense innervation of L4 by thalamic inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, the contribution of thalamic input in L4 and L5 of anaesthetized mice was very similar to the contribution of these inputs to the same layers in awake mice.</s></p><p><s>Similar to previous studies of the visual and auditory cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> , cortical silencing showed that the contribution of thalamic inputs was invariant to the optimality of stimulation.</s><s>We demonstrated it comparing the contribution of thalamic inputs when independently stimulating the PW and one of the AWs within the same cells.</s><s>This suggests that the local circuitry of a cortical cell amplifies its thalamic inputs in a particular manner for each cell, regardless of the feature that activates this cell.</s></p><p><s>Recurrent cortical activity engaged quite rapidly, roughly at the same time of the onset of thalamic input, as evident when the average response to whisker stimulation in intact cortex was compared with the time course of thalamic input alone under cortical silencing.</s><s>Naively, one would expect that recurrent inputs will be delayed by a few milliseconds with respect to the onset of thalamic input, as it involves at least one additional synapse.</s><s>However, this does not necessarily need to be the case.</s><s>Assuming that we sampled the cortical population randomly, the thalamic input would arrive to some cells relatively early, whereas to others it would arrive later, The earliest firing in L4 can be as short as 5 ms following whisker stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> , therefore, local cortical cells should provide input to other cells roughly at the same time or even before the onset of thalamic input of cells that are not the 'primer' cells.</s><s>Indeed, the latency of the response under cortical silencing in some of our recorded cells was clearly delayed by a couple of milliseconds relative to the onset of the response when the cortex was intact (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>, cell #W8).</s><s>Hence, recurrent cortical activity engages rapidly in the somatosensory cortex.</s><s>Rapid amplification of thalamic inputs is evident also in the studies of the visual and auditory cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The origin of noise correlation of sensory responses in primary sensory cortical areas is under dispute.</s><s>In one view, the variability in sensory responses mostly depends on subcortical processing of sensory inputs and therefore on the variability of the thalamic inputs.</s><s>According to this possibility, cortical responses fluctuate from trial to trial due to noisy thalamic inputs, and since these inputs are shared, the responses of different cortical cells are correlated.</s><s>This view is supported by measurements of trial-totrial spiking variability in geniculate cells of the visual system <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> and the similarity in the variance of membrane potential responses to brief visual stimulation of L4 cells in V1, before and after inactivation of cortical firing using electrical stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>However, our results are in line with a different view, suggesting that cortical synchrony emerges due to intracortical inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> .</s><s>In contrast to the findings of Sadagopan and Ferster 4 , our experiments show that the cortex adds substantial variance to that which originates from the thalamic inputs, as the standard deviation of the response was significantly larger during intact cortical firing compared with that measured when the cortex was silenced.</s><s>Direct measurements of trial-to-trial correlation indicate that they are not determined by thalamic inputs.</s><s>In awake mice, the degree of correlation between excitatory inputs of L4 cells and nearby LFP signal, when the cortex was intact, was highly variable across the population.</s><s>This was observed both for ongoing activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6f</ref>) and for the evoked response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6i</ref>).</s><s>A large range of correlations was also measured between the excitatory currents in anaesthetized mice.</s><s>In other studies of the barrel cortex in awake mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , nearby cells, recorded in layer 2/3, exhibited a much narrower range of correlation during ongoing activity and on average it was higher than what we report in this study of L4.</s><s>This discrepancy probably reflects laminar differences in the strength of correlations.</s><s>Indeed, the correlated variability of extracellularly recorded neurons in upper cortical layers of the visual cortex of awake monkeys was found to be significantly higher than between cells located in the granular layer (that is, layer 4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The wide range of correlation strengths between individually recorded cells and the nearby LFP in awake animals, as well as between the paired intracellular recordings in anaesthetized animals, is reminiscent of the large diversity of network coupling that was recently reported in the visual cortex using extracellular recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</s><s>According to the study of Okun and his colleagues, the diversity in network coupling is related to the strength of synaptic connections made between individual cells and their neighbouring population.</s><s>They showed that cells that received more synaptic inputs from their neighbours exhibited higher coupling with network activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</s><s>Although we have no direct evidence that supports this conjuncture in our study, we know from our recordings that the strength of ongoing and noise correlations between cortical cells are weakly dependent on their shared thalamic inputs.</s><s>This happens despite the large contribution of thalamic inputs to the total sensory-evoked excitatory currents (B50%).</s></p><p><s>Several factors contribute to noise correlation of thalamic excitatory inputs of cortical cells upon sensory stimulation.</s><s>These include noise correlation of thalamic cells, the convergentdivergent organization of thalamo-cortical ascending axons and co-modulation of thalamo-cortical synapses by neuromodulators or GABA(B) presynaptic contacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>In addition, the reliability of ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms12740 axonal transmission of individual thalamic cells, such as result from axonal failure and from the reliability of synaptic release, may reduce the noise correlation between cortical Because of the large number of thalamic fibres that converge on each cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , due to averaging, the reliability in axonal conductance or synaptic release should have a negligible effect on the variability of the total synaptic thalamic input of individual cortical cells or their impact on correlated variability.</s><s>Our method, however, bypasses these factors all together, allowing us to measure the impact of these factors when summed together.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we found that synaptic correlations of nearby cortical cells in L4 and L5 during ongoing and sensory-evoked activities are poorly related to their thalamic excitatory inputs.</s><s>Moreover, the contribution of thalamic inputs varies considerably across the population.</s><s>The functional role of the asynchronous nature of thalamic inputs and diversity in thalamic contribution in L4 is unclear.</s><s>An intriguing possibility is that such connectivity may smooth the population response curve to a wide range of stimuli, allowing better encoding of sensory inputs.</s><s>Indeed, the amount of possible information that could be extracted from a neuronal population is constrained by the noise correlations of the response <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, emergence of synchronous activity locally by cortical mechanisms is essential for cortical computations.</s></p></div>
