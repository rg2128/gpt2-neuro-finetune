ignoring it may result in misleading inference about transmission dynamics by underestimating the probability that an infectious agent will persist <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Sources of heterogeneity in mosquito-borne disease transmission include uneven distribution of hosts and breeding sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, differences in host susceptibility to infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and the nonuniform distribution of mosquito bites among spatially distributed hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (per-capita biting rates).</s><s>The number of mosquitoes that bite a host depends, among other things, on the number that find it.</s><s>Host finding by mosquitoes is largely driven by olfactory cues that are given off by individual hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The spatial arrangement of hosts is likely to affect the spatial distribution of the odor plume and thus the mosquitoes' ability to locate and feed on them.</s><s>For example, it may be easier for a mosquito to find a large roost of birds than to find an single bird.</s><s>Unless the probability of finding a host is exactly proportional to the density of hosts, unevenly distributed contact rates on individual hosts, and thus heterogeneous disease transmission, will result.</s><s>Understanding the dynamics of odor-driven mosquito-host interaction is fundamental to a detailed mechanistic understanding of mosquito-borne transmission.</s></p><p><s>Despite its important epidemiological implications, experimental data on the relationship between host aggregation and mosquito-host contact rates are sparse, and thus, little is known definitively about mosquito strategies for finding hosts.</s><s>The goal of this work is to propose a modeling framework that can provide preliminary insights into the relative effectiveness of different hostseeking strategies used by mosquitoes.</s><s>In this paper, we develop, assess, and utilize a mathematical model to simulate both the odor plume in the presence of wind and the host-seeking behavior of mosquitoes in response to that odor plume.</s><s>Mosquitoes are modeled as discrete agents that fly continuously in search of discrete hosts (birds).</s><s>The flight direction and speed of individual mosquitoes is influenced by wind and odors emitted by the hosts.</s><s>The wind is composed of a deterministic, large-scale component plus a stochastic component to represent small-scale eddies and fluctuations.</s><s>In this study we focus on mosquito host-seeking behavior within meters of a host, motivated by indoor experiments involving mosquito-bird interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The Discussion section describes the potential for larger scale simulations that incorporate more of the host-seeking process.</s><s>We hope that the model may serve as a virtual laboratory for testing different hypotheses for how mosquitoes use odor plumes to locate potential hosts and may offer guidance both to the planning of experimental studies and to the interpretation of experimental data.</s></p><p><s>This contribution joins a group of other important mathematical models for simulating the host-seeking dynamics of mosqui-toes.</s><s>Commonly, models are based on parameters such as contact rates and probabilities (of feeding, diversion, dying, etc.).</s><s>Often these models assume homogeneous mixing and do not include space explicitly, so that the probabilities and contact rates are independent of location.</s><s>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the authors describe a kinetic, non-spatially explicit model to determine how much coverage is enough to protect individuals who do not use insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in the context of malaria transmission.</s><s>The model has also been modified to explore the effects of bed nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and to introduce 'bloodless' hosts such as baited traps <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The latter also modeled the host-seeking process as a non-host oriented kinesis followed by a host-oriented taxis once the mosquito has encountered an odor cue.</s><s>A related model for the mosquito feeding cycle addressing the effect of ITNs on malaria transmission is found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>One model that does include space explicitly is that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for plume finding in the context of an underwater substrate.</s><s>The authors use a model in which the probability of detecting the plume depends on the seeker's movements, on the fluid motion, and on the plume shape in space and time.</s><s>They report that as plume-detection success increases, the efficiency decreases (the process is slow).</s><s>Our results are consistent with this observation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mosquito host-seeking behavior</head><p><s>We provide a review of the biological literature that influenced our modeling choices.</s><s>The scenario that we consider is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where hosts are distributed in groups, or patches, and they emit an odor (e.g.</s><s>CO 2 ) that gets carried by and diffused in the wind in the same way that a puff of smoke dissipates in time.</s><s>Uniform, laminar wind extends host odor into a long, thin plume with sharp transverse gradients and shallow longitudinal gradients.</s><s>If the wind is turbulent, the odor plume is highly intermittent, but still retains relatively shallow average longitudinal gradients compared to the transverse gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>We class mosquito host-seeking behavior as either plume finding, which is flight in search of an odor plume, or plume tracking, which is flight within the odor plume (these terms are adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Plume finding: Absence of odor cues.</s><s>There is little consensus in the literature about mosquito host-seeking behavior in the absence of odor cues.</s><s>If wind is absent, orientation may be determined by large visual features in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or may be characterized as a directionally unbiased random walk, also called kinesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>If wind is present, then mosquitoes may deliberately choose to fly upwind, downwind, or crosswind in search of a host, which are types of directional searching referred to as anemotaxis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Each of the three anemotactic behaviors has been described as plausible based on either experimental or theoretical work.</s><s>Mosquitoes typically fly upwind in laboratory wind tunnels even when there is no odor present <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>In wind tunnel experiments, a low velocity artificial wind is blown across an odor source down an enclosure toward a mosquito entrance.</s><s>Mosquitoes are released into the tunnel and their flight path is videotaped.</s></p><p><s>In control experiments where no odor is added to the wind, many mosquitoes fly upwind and some even locate the ''source'' -the wind entrance into the tunnel.</s><s>However, a set of field experiments reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> provided evidence for downwind flights in hostseeking Mansonia spp.</s><s>In these experiments, a human subject was surrounded on the downwind side by a tall, hemispherical fence of radius 18 m, to exclude mosquitoes using an upwind search strategy.</s><s>By comparison with controls, the authors concluded that some mosquitoes employ a downwind plume-finding strategy.</s><s>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> it is argued using geometry that crosswind searching is the most effective when the odor plumes are long and thin.</s><s>If the variability of the wind direction is greater than 30 degrees, then a mathematical argument shows that upwind or downwind searching is optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Mosquito response to wind depends on the strength of the wind.</s><s>A typical mosquito flight speed is 1 m/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>As reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, mosquitoes fly faster than the wind speed when they are in the low velocity boundary layer that forms adjacent to the ground.</s><s>If they ascend too far (especially during the daytime when turbulence is greater), they are swept up and transported passively for long distances.</s><s>Some mosquitoes may have adapted to use this as a deliberate migration mechanism.</s><s>However, most of the flights that mosquitoes make are short-range, appetitive flights seeking a blood meal or oviposition site near the mosquito's home territory.</s><s>Appetitive flights are disrupted by sufficiently high wind speeds, although the wind speeds at which this happens vary by species and geographic region.</s><s>Wind speeds as low as 0.8 m/s (3 km/h) have been reported to drastically reduce the number of mosquito host-seeking flights, but no reduction in mosquito flight was documented in other situations for speeds as high as 3-8 m/s (11-29 km/h).</s></p><p><s>Plume tracking: Presence of odor cues.</s><s>When a mosquito encounters an odor plume, it uses the odor plume and the wind to guide its flight to locate the host.</s><s>Odor cues are complex olfactory signals released from a host's skin and breath.</s><s>Many compounds are known to excite the chemoreceptors of mosquitoes.</s><s>CO 2 , for example, is an important component in the odor plume that activates and helps maintain plume tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Laboratory wind tunnel experiments indicate that sustained flight only occurs in the presence of an intermittent CO 2 signal and not in uniform concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Other wind tunnel experiments suggested that broad, well-mixed CO 2 plumes may inhibit upwind flight while turbulent plumes of the same concentration induce upwind flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>The importance of lactic acid, various aldehydes, and whole host odors for the location of hosts by mosquitoes has also been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Dekker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> note that there is not a single model that fits mosquito flight response to all relevant host odors, even within a single species.</s></p><p><s>Mosquitoes exhibit different behavior in windy and windless conditions.</s><s>In the absence of wind within the odor plume, mosquitoes must rely solely on odor cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or on large

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing changing host density</head><p><s>Standard models of mosquito-borne transmission assume that the mosquito contact rate on one host is inversely proportional to the numbers of hosts (reviewed, e.g. by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>).</s><s>This is likely true when hosts are so abundant that a mosquito will always be able to locate one.</s><s>Our simulations indicate that the probability that a mosquito will locate a host is largely determined by the shape of the odor plume (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</s><s>However, the shape of an odor plume is difficult to predict, since it depends on local wind velocity and turbulence due to landscape features.</s><s>We therefore propose an approximation that does not depend on plume shape, and is instead based on b, which can be viewed as a patchiness parameter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</s><s>This allows us to model contact rates when hosts are variably distributed over patches within a larger domain more realistically even if exact features of the relevant odor plumes are unknown.</s></p><p><s>We derive a patchiness-driven contact rate model by starting with the contact rate for malaria transmission from Chitnis et al.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> which applies specifically in the case of homogeneous mixing in a fixed area without considering host-seeking mechanisms.</s><s>They propose a vector-host contact rate of</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_14">C~s v N v s h N h s v N v zs h N h ,</formula><p><s>where s v is the number of contacts each mosquito wants per unit time, s h is the maximum number of contacts a host can receive per unit time, N v is the total number of vectors and N h is the total number of hosts.</s><s>This implies that s v N v is the approximate contact rate when the mosquito population is small since every mosquito in a small population is expected to locate a host when the populations are homogeneously mixed.</s><s>We seek to modify this expression to account for host patch area, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, and mosquito behavior.</s><s>When the hosts are limited to a small patch of area within a larger region, we make two modifications to the formula above.</s><s>First, not every mosquito in a small population can be expected to find a host, since not all of the mosquitoes will come into contact with the odor plume.</s><s>For this reason, we replace the contact rate with bs v N v , where b represents the ratio of the diameter of the patch where the hosts are located to the diameter of the CO 2 simulation region.</s><s>The second modification comes from the fact that even when the patch size becomes small (and b&amp;0), the number of contacts must be nonzero since even a tiny area produces a plume that mosquitoes can follow to a host.</s><s>We want our modified contact rate function to be consistent with the original function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> when b~1, which is the case where the host patch is equal to the entire CO 2 simulation region.</s><s>Based on these observations we propose the modified contact function</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_15">C m ~bs v N v s h N h bs v N v zs h N h zP 0 (1{b)s v N v ,<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p><s>where P 0 represents the proportion of mosquitoes that find a host as the patch of area containing the hosts becomes infinitesimally small.</s><s>We note that when the host patches are small (i.e.</s><s>small b), Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) can be linearized to read C m &amp;s v N v ½P 0 zb(1{P 0 ), where the factor in brackets, P 0 zb(1{P 0 ), is interpreted as the proportion of mosquitoes that find a host for a given patch-to-region length ratio b.</s><s>This proportion can be computed from the simulations, as shown by the lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. Therefore, reasonable assumptions about the patchy distribution of hosts in the domain allow us to devise a quantitatively reasonable estimate of the host-finding probability of mosquitoes for the space and time scales considered here.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The length and time scales in the simulations presented here were motivated by the indoor experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and a desire to quantify mosquito success near the end of a host-seeking flight.</s><s>Our conclusions must be validated for spatial domains or time periods that are significantly larger.</s><s>Furthermore, there are other probability distributions that can be used for mosquito navigational choices (see e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) and a variety of initial mosquito spatial arrangements that may affect our conclusions.</s></p><p><s>Such parameter choices are within the capabilities of the model, and to demonstrate we briefly present a simulation of a growing odor plume in a large domain.</s><s>Mosquitoes engaging in all three types of plume finding (2000 mosquitoes each) were initially uniformly distributed over a disk of radius 100 m centered on four clusters of ten roosting birds each.</s><s>The wind meandered according to an incompressible flow appropriate for the large domain size and the crosswind mosquitoes flew in the same direction for a number of decisions chosen from a Le ´vy distribution having a power law in the tail of p(')*' {2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>The Le ´vy distribution was centered at 0.7 s, the mean value of T cwd in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, and only positive values were sampled.</s><s>The mosquitoes were placed in the domain after 150 seconds when the odor plume was approximately 35 meters long.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> shows the state of the odor plume after 250 s and 500 s, along with the positions of all nearby mosquitoes.</s><s>The simulation was run for 1500 s, at which point the odor plume was about 180 m in length and 4.2%, 6.4%, and 26.6% of the upwind, downwind, and crosswind mosquitoes had located a host respectively.</s><s>The success rate was lower compared to the smaller domain, particularly for the upwind and downwind mosquitoes that rapidly left the plume behind (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, right).</s><s>The crosswind mosquitoes moved downwind at the same rate the plume did, and therefore had many more opportunities to intercept it.</s><s>There were still a substantial number of crosswind mosquitoes interacting with the plume when the simulation ceased.</s></p><p><s>We hope to expand our careful analysis of the smaller domain to a larger domain in the future.</s><s>In larger domains, it would be interesting to include the effect of mosquito breeding sites and how their locations affect the biting rate of hosts near them in comparison to hosts living farther away.</s><s>Significant differences in the biting rates in spatial relation to breeding sites have been reported for malaria in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future directions</head><p><s>There are other potential model extensions that are equally interesting.</s><s>Disease transmission via mosquito bite, host movement, infection, and demographic processes in both vertebrate hosts and mosquitoes and the dependence of these processes on biotic and abiotic factors could be integrated with the existing model for explicit small-scale modeling of disease spread.</s><s>This modeling framework is capable of accommodating many further levels of complexity, such as gusting wind, moving hosts, multiple host types, odor-baited traps, variable breathing rate, compound odors, repellents, etc.</s><s>The challenge will be to identify the components that most strongly affect the behavior of the model system and the underlying reality on which it is based.</s><s>For example, in the simulations presented here the spread of the host odor is dominated by turbulent convection and diffusion plays a very minor role.</s><s>It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the particular odor cue used by the mosquitoes will have little effect, and that substituting lactic acid for CO 2 (for example) will not impact the resultant contact rates.</s><s>See <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for a discussion of turbulent mixing versus molecular diffusion in the context of chemotaxis.</s></p><p><s>Additional factors could be included in the model in order to capture subtle differences between mosquito species, lighting effects, and other elements not included in the current work.</s><s>Hosts tend to attract mosquitoes in unequal ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Differential attractiveness, the emission of different levels of CO 2 by different hosts as well as multiple odor cues can also be introduced into the model to study situations like those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, where mosquitoes of many species finding humans distributed in huts, or in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, where mosquitoes were collected inside village houses in Tanzania.</s><s>These studies report an approximate direct relationship between the number of inhabitants per house and the number of mosquitoes collected.</s><s>Our model could be used to study which factors influence more strongly this relationship.</s></p><p><s>From the point of view of controlling the vector population, the model presented here may offer some insights into how the spatial distribution of mosquito traps may affect the overall control.</s><s>This can be accomplished by replacing the hosts in the model with odor-baited mosquito traps and adjusting appropriate parameters.</s><s>This was addressed in a non-spatial model by Okumu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, where homogeneous mixing of hosts was assumed.</s><s>They discuss the importance of space in the vector-host contact process and indicate that the rate at which an individual host is discovered by an individual vector depends on the distance between hosts and vectors as well as on the size of the odor plumes generated by the hosts.</s><s>Further, spatial characteristics such as the topography and wind direction are known to be influential in the rates at which individual hosts are found.</s><s>Our model can explicitly include spatial features to compare strategies of where to place mosquito traps relative to blood-source hosts.</s><s>According to the studies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> the distances at which various species of mosquitoes responded to CO 2 baits by initiating orientation toward the them was 30 meters or less.</s><s>Therefore, the small model length scales presented here are appropriate for such simulations.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 2.
