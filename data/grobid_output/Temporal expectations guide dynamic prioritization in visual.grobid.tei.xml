<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Working memory pertains to the fundamental cognitive ability to retain and manipulate currently relevant information in an active store, in service of ongoing task demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baddeley, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">D'Esposito and Postle, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, working memory is an essential component within everyday tasks, such as monitoring surrounding traffic when driving a car, or comprehending speech.</s><s>To support adaptive behavior in such dynamic tasks, it is evident that working memory representations, too, must be highly dynamic.</s><s>Despite this consideration, however, commonly used laboratory tasks of working memory (such as change detection and continuous reproduction) require the retention of a set number of items throughout a shared retention interval.</s><s>Here, we investigated working memory in a more dynamic setting, asking whether and how internally guided temporal expectations can lead to the dynamic prioritization of different items in working memory at different times.</s><s>We also investigated the neural substrates of such dynamic prioritization using EEG.</s></p><p><s>Over the past decade, it has become well established that the fate of perceptual working memory representations can continue to be influenced after encoding.</s><s>For example, attentional cues presented during the retention interval (retro-cues) facilitate subsequent responses about the cued item <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Griffin and Nobre, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Landman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pertzov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Souza and Oberauer, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>These studies have thus demonstrated that spatial and/or object-based attentional biases continue to operate during working memory and have led to the view that, among several items in working memory, a subset of the items (usually one), can be in a "prioritized state" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cowan, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Oberauer, 2002)</ref> (i.e., in the "focus of attention").</s></p><p><s>From the perceptual domain, there is ample evidence that temporal expectations provide another potent source of attentional biasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Coull and Nobre, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ghose and Maunsell, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nobre et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Based on this work, we hypothesized that temporal expectations also continue to operate during working memory, by facilitating the accessibility and the accuracy of mnemonic representations at those times at which they are deemed most relevant.</s><s>We were interested in testing, therefore, whether prioritization of an item for access in working memory could be controlled flexibly through prediction about when its retrieval was required.</s><s>We were additionally interested in the neural substrates supporting such flexible item prioritization.</s></p><p><s>In the perceptual domain, the attenuation of 8 -14 Hz ␣ oscillations is a prominent index of the allocation of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Foxe et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Worden et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Thut et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Klimesch et al., 2007)</ref>, which is associated with the engagement of the underlying neuronal populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Haegens et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>More recently, attenuated ␣ oscillations over taskrelevant sensory areas have also been implicated in the retention of perceptual representations in working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jokisch and Jensen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sauseng et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Spitzer and Blankenburg, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, several recent studies have suggested that spatially specific decreases in ␣ oscillations are triggered by orienting attention to an item's spatial location in working memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Myers et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Poch et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wallis et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mok et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It has not yet been established, however, whether such attentional ␣ modulations during working memory also (1) support temporal attention; in accordance with observations in the perceptual domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rohenkohl and Nobre, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">van Ede et al., 2011)</ref>, and (2) predict mnemonic performance on a trial-by-trial basis.</s><s>Moreover, prior studies could not rule out lateralized retro-cue processing and/or probe anticipation.</s><s>To avoid these potential confounds in the present study, we manipulated spatiotemporal expectations through learned associations with the item colors (instead of asymmetrical retro-cues) and presented probes centrally (instead of at the peripheral location of the item during encoding).</s></p><p><s>We thus hypothesize that temporal expectations can dynamically guide which item in visual working memory is currently prioritized, and that this will be reflected in measures of working memory performance, as well as in spatially and temporally specific modulations of posterior ␣ oscillations that are relevant for working memory performance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Twenty-four healthy human volunteers (13 male, mean age: 24 years, range: 19 -34 years) participated in the study.</s><s>Based on previous EEG studies, we aimed at a sample size of ϳ25 but stopped at 24 for counterbalancing purposes (i.e., to ensure an equal number of participants with each color-delay mapping).</s><s>Data from all participants were retained for analysis.</s><s>The experiment was approved by the Central University Research Ethics Committee of the University of Oxford.</s><s>Participants provided written informed consent before participation and were paid £10/h.</s></p><p><s>Experimental design and procedure.</s><s>Participants performed a visual working memory task (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) that required the short-term retention of two oriented peripheral bars: one on the left and one on the right of a screen.</s><s>One was always yellow (RGB colors: 255,241,0) and the other was always blue <ref type="bibr">(RGB colors: 0,</ref><ref type="bibr">173,</ref><ref type="bibr">238)</ref>.</s><s>Bar orientations were randomly and independently drawn for each item and trial.</s><s>In each trial, participants were probed about only one item, at one of two possible delays (1250/2500 ms) after encoding (which lasted 250 ms).</s><s>The key manipulation was that, if probed early, the item of one color was most likely to be probed, whereas, if probed late, the other colored item was most likely.</s><s>The passing of the early interval (in late probe trials) was never explicitly indicated to participants.</s><s>Color-delay mappings were 80% valid and were counterbalanced across participants (while kept constant within a given participant).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the case for which the yellow item is expected early, and the blue item late.</s><s>Participants were informed about the color-delay mapping at the start of the experiment and practiced one block of 40 trials to acquaint themselves with the relevant intervals.</s></p><p><s>At a viewing distance of 90 cm, bars had a diameter of 6.4 degrees visual angle and were centered at 6.4 degrees visual angle to the left and right of fixation.</s><s>Color-side mappings were randomly varied on a trial-by-trial basis.</s><s>To promote a visual strategy for working memory retention, we presented the items inside "placeholders" (i.e., see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, gray circles) that were kept on the screen throughout the retention interval.</s><s>Critically, however, these placeholders contained no information regarding the relevant mnemonic variable, which was orientation.</s></p><p><s>Working memory was probed using a continuous reproduction task.</s><s>A probe was presented in the center of the screen that consisted of a gray circle (with the same diameter as the oriented bars) with two "handles" (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Handles were placed on opposite sides to indicate the probe's orientation.</s><s>Participants' task was to reproduce the orientation of the probed item by aligning these handles to the remembered orientation, using the mouse.</s><s>The color of the handles (yellow/blue) indicated which item was to be reported.</s><s>One of the handles had a slightly thicker edge, marking the current position of the mouse's cursor.</s><s>The starting orientation was drawn randomly for each trial.</s></p><p><s>Following the appearance of the probe screen, participants were given unlimited time to decide what to report.</s><s>However, once they started to move the mouse, they were given only limited time (2500 ms) to complete their orientation reproduction.</s><s>Elapsed time was displayed under the probe (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Before time would run out, participants could click the mouse to verify their response and continue with the task.</s><s>Immediately after a response, feedback was provided: if the reported orientation was within 15 degrees of the target orientation, the fixation cross turned green for 250 ms (with brighter greens for more precise reports); otherwise, it turned red.</s><s>Intertrial intervals were drawn randomly between 750 and 1000 ms.</s></p><p><s>Participants completed 15 blocks of 40 trials each (totaling 600 trials).</s><s>Between blocks, participants performed a short eye-tracker calibration session and were presented with a (task-free) visual localizer that was included to assist the EEG analysis.</s><s>The visual localizer consisted of 40 randomly drawn oriented bars that were each presented for 250 ms, either to the left or right of fixation.</s><s>Localizer stimuli matched the task stimuli in terms of color, location, and size.</s><s>Interstimulus intervals were randomly drawn between 300 and 400 ms.</s></p><p><s>Our EEG analysis aimed to capitalize on the fact that the items that were expected to be probed early and late were presented in different hemifields.</s><s>This analysis thus assumes some degree of "retinotopic pres-ervation" of the mnemonic items during working memory retention (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kuo et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>To this end, two elements of our experimental design aimed to promote a retinotopically specific retention strategy.</s><s>First, the visual items were presented inside placeholders, and these placeholders were left on the screen throughout the retention interval (assisting participants to remember the relevant orientation information at the encoded locations).</s><s>Second, the probe's location was identical for both items.</s><s>Whereas under certain circumstances participants may "shift" the mnemonic item to the to-be-probed location soon after encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Zaksas et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pasternak and Zaksas, 2003)</ref>, in our experiment this would likely lead to interference between both items because the to-beprobed location is the same for both items.</s><s>Therefore, keeping the items at their encoded locations during retention may help reduce interference between them.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of behavioral data.</s><s>We focused on two behavioral variables of interest.</s><s>First, we calculated the average error of the reproduction report by taking the absolute angular difference between the target orientation and the reported orientation, and averaged this value across all trials within each condition.</s><s>Second, we calculated the average decision time for each condition, which was defined as the time between the onset of the probe screen and the start of the reproduction report.</s><s>All trials for which the decision time was Ͼ5 SDs above the mean decision time were excluded from the analysis.</s><s>For both dependent variables, we subjected the participant-specific averages to a repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors "expected time" and "probed time."</s><s>Complementary to this, we also assigned conditions as "valid" and "invalid" and compared these classes using paired-sample t tests.</s></p><p><s>EEG acquisition and analysis.</s><s>We acquired EEG using Synamps amplifiers and Neuroscan data acquisition software (Compumedics).</s><s>We used a custom 42 channel setup with the following subset of electrodes of the international 10 -10 system: FPz, AFz, AF3/4, AF7/8, Fz, F1/2, F3/4, FCz, FC1/2 FC5/6, Cz, C3/4, T7/8, CP1/2, CP5/6, Pz, P1/2, P3/4, P5/6, P7/8, POz, PO3/4, PO7/8, Oz, O1/2, thus providing most dense coverage over posterior sites of interest (see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>The left mastoid was used as the active reference, and we included a right mastoid measurement to derive an average-mastoid reference offline.</s><s>The ground was placed on the left upper arm.</s><s>During acquisition, data were low-pass filtered by an anti-aliasing filter (250 Hz cutoff), digitized at 1000 Hz, and stored for offline analysis.</s></p><p><s>EEG data were analyzed in MATLAB using FieldTrip <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Oostenveld et al., 2011)</ref> (RRID: SCR_004849).</s><s>During data preprocessing, we removed line noise using a discrete Fourier Transform filter, cut out our epochs of interest, and removed excessively noisy epochs based on visual inspection of the signal's variance across trials and channels.</s><s>This was done once for variance calculated on the broadband signal and, subsequently, once for variance calculated on the 8 -30 Hz bandpass-filtered signal (to detect artifacts specific to the frequency range of interest).</s><s>Artifact rejection was performed on all trials, without knowledge of the conditions to which trials belonged.</s></p><p><s>Localizer-based channel selection.</s><s>We first analyzed our visual localizer data to find the electrodes that were most susceptible to visual processing of the left and right stimulus locations.</s><s>We did this separately for each participant.</s><s>To this end, we contrasted left and right visual localizer stimuli with regard to (8 -14 Hz) ␣ power in the 150 -400 ms poststimulus window and expressed this as a relative change (i.e., [left Ϫ right]/ [left ϩ right] ϫ 100).</s><s>The subset of the electrodes (usually four, but see below) showing the most negative (positive) contrast values were then selected to represent the right (left) visual areas.</s><s>We aimed to select four electrodes on either side, but depending on the specific pattern that we observed, we sometimes picked three of five.</s><s>Critically, this selection was made before looking at the task data of interest.</s><s>To confirm that this approach converged on meaningful channel selections, we depict the proportion of participants for which a given channel was selected in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Time-frequency analysis.</s><s>We used a short-time Fourier transform to estimate time-and frequency-resolved estimates of oscillatory power.</s><s>We estimated power for frequencies between 5 and 30 Hz (in steps of 1 Hz), and used a 400 ms sliding time window that was advanced in steps of 80 ms.</s><s>We obtained time-frequency maps for each of the selected chan-nels and collapsed across the channels belonging to the same (left/right) visual channel clusters.</s><s>For each channel cluster, we then contrasted trials in which the item contralateral to the cluster was expected early versus trials in which this item was expected late (i.e., [early Ϫ late]/[early ϩ late] ϫ 100).</s><s>Because of our design, this is equivalent to contrasting trials in which the item expected early was contralateral versus ipsilateral to the channel cluster.</s><s>We calculated this contrast of interested separately for both channel clusters, and collapsed their outcomes.</s><s>To avoid contamination of visual processing of early probes, we only included time windows in which this probe had not yet occurred.</s><s>As a result, the expectation-related time-frequency maps (as depicted in Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>) were based on all trials in the early interval, but based on only the lateprobe trials in the late interval.</s></p><p><s>Trialwise correlations with performance.</s><s>For our trialwise correlation analysis, we centered time-frequency maps at probe onset and evaluated correlations with working memory performance separately for the channel clusters that were contralateral and ipsilateral to the side of the relevant (i.e., expected and probed) mnemonic item at encoding.</s><s>We only included valid trials because only in these trials are contralateral and ipsilateral loci defined relative to both preprobe and postprobe time windows.</s><s>Provided that oscillatory power and behavioral performance are each likely to covary with time-on-task, we calculated partial correlations in which we included trial numbers to factor out this potential contribution.</s></p><p><s>Statistical approach.</s><s>The independent visual localizer allowed us to focus our analysis of the task data on the most relevant visual channel clusters while avoiding selection bias.</s><s>Using these channel clusters, we were able to reduce our analysis to several targeted time-frequency maps (as described above).</s><s>Statistical testing of the EEG data focused exclusively on these time-frequency maps.</s><s>To this end, we used a cluster-based permutation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Maris and Oostenveld, 2007)</ref>, which circumvents the multiple-comparison problem by evaluating the full timefrequency space under a single permutation distribution of the largest cluster.</s><s>However, to better appreciate the plausibility (see van Ede and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maris, 2016)</ref> of the patterns behind these significant clusters, we also plotted spatial maps and bar graphs associated with these clusters.</s><s>However, these were presented solely for descriptive purposes and were (deliberately) not subjected to further statistical tests.</s></p><p><s>Eye-tracking acquisition and analysis.</s><s>Gaze was monitored using an Eye-Link 1000 eye-tracker (SR Research).</s><s>Data were sampled at 1000 Hz and stored for offline analysis.</s><s>Offline, we synchronized the gaze data with the EEG data on the basis of event triggers that were sent to both the EEG and the eye-tracker acquisition devices.</s><s>A custom eye-tracker calibration session was included after every block in which participants were asked to track a green square that was presented at the same eccentricities of the visual stimuli that were used in the experiment.</s><s>On the basis of these data, we determined the eye-tracker values that were associated with these locations,
