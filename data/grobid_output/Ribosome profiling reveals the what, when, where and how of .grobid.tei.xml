<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity and precision of quantification.</head><p><s>Ribosome profiling provides a large dynamic range for the detection and quantification of translation in unperturbed cells.</s><s>The sensitivity of the method, which results from the depth of sampling that is possible in sequencing studies, facilitates the measurement of even relatively rare translation events, with the range of detection generally limited only by the counting variability that is seen with very low numbers of sequencing reads.</s><s>Complementary methods, including pulsed label-based mass spectrometry, analyses of transcript distributions on polysome gradients and 35 S Met-based metabolic labelling, enable sensitive measurement of new protein synthesis; however, the highly parallel sequencing readout of all ribosome positions that is provided by ribosome profiling typically yields more quantitative and detailed information than is currently accessible by alternative methods.</s></p><p><s>Precision of positional information.</s><s>In addition to its broad dynamic range of detection, ribosome profiling provides uniquely rich and precise positional information.</s><s>The almost universal biophysical properties of ribosomes across species yield a characteristic footprint size that allows prediction of the codon in the r ibosome P site (that is, the position of peptide bond formation) and the detection of codon periodicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> (FIG.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Analyses of ribosome footprint positions can be used to mechanistically probe aspects of translation, thus far identifying many novel examples of ribosomal frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, ribosome pausing, translation initiation at non-AUG codons and uORF translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (FIG.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, years after many genomes were originally annotated, the precise positional information obtained from ribosome profiling experiments has provided the first opportunity to experimentally define translated ORFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> (FIGS. 1,2),</s><s>resulting in the identification of new classes of coding regions in diverse organisms.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instantaneous measurements.</head><p><s>A final valuable property of ribosome profiling is the instantaneous nature of the information that is collected, which reflects a snapshot of the dynamic process of translation.</s><s>Although mRNA-seq and standard genome-scale mass spectrometry experiments are valuable in following gene expression globally, these widely used measurements report on steady-state levels of mRNA and protein, respectively.</s><s>This information is important, but it may not reflect the rapid cellular decision making that accompanies developmental transitions and environmental responses.</s><s>Ribosome profiling enables sensitive detection of changes in cellular protein expression as they occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>The common, quantitative output from ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq further allows for direct comparison of instantaneous protein synthesis and steady-state transcript levels, providing an opportunity to quantify in vivo translation efficiencies in detail (FIG.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>What are the limitations of the method?</s></p><p><s>We discuss below notable weaknesses and caveats of ribosome profiling that should be considered when using the method or interpreting data derived from its use.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimentally introduced distortions.</head><p><s>The key technical challenge of ribosome profiling is the need to rapidly inhibit translation to capture a snapshot of ribosomes in a particular physiological state.</s><s>The reliability of this step is particularly important for any analyses of translation pausing, as the fast rate of translation elongation may result in signal blurring or the artificial accumulation of ribosomes at specific positions if inhibition is slow.</s><s>The use of a translation elongation inhibitor (such as cycloheximide) can be valuable; however, it is clear that such inhibitors can alter the local distributions of ribosomes on an mRNA, especially near translation start sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Although this does not seem to interfere with the global measurements of the density of ribosomes on an mRNA that are used to determine rates of protein synthesis, it can cause spurious peaks of ribosome binding at particular sites.</s><s>Thus far, flash freezing has been the most robust approach in a wide range of diverse organisms and has enabled the physiological capture of local and global ribosome distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>In general, each experimental step -from cell harvesting to nuclease digestion to library generation -has the potential to cause distortions in the data output.</s><s>These distortions must be accounted for carefully, as the degree to which any given distortion might be problematic will depend strongly on the questions being addressed and the syste m being probed.</s></p><p><s>The need to infer protein synthesis rates.</s><s>A caveat to consider when interpreting ribosome profiling data is that rates of synthesis are typically inferred from the average ribosome density along the mRNA in question.</s><s>The accuracy of this measure depends on the premise that all ribosomes finish translation and that, on average, the translation elongation rate is similar among different mRNAs in a cell.</s><s>These assumptions can be tested and are appropriate for a wide range of conditions, but this will not always be the case.</s><s>Known exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> -including the build-up of ribosomes at and immediately proximal to the start codon in a partially cycloheximide-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> or regulated translation pausing and abortion under starvation conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> -can be corrected for to increase measurement accuracy, but there may be cases in which these and other, currently unknown, exceptions pose challenges for proper data analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contaminating footprint-sized fragments.</head><p><s>Another important issue for ribosome profiling experiments is that footprints are inferred on the basis of their size and their association with assembled (80S) ribosomes.</s></p><p><s>Contaminating RNA fragments, including those from</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fragment length organization similarity score (FLOSS) analysis</head><p><s>A metric for determining the probability that ribosome footprints over a given region (or set of regions) result from translation.</s><s>This analysis involves comparing size distributions of footprints over a query region and over validated coding regions and is based on the concept that the biophysical properties of translating ribosomes result in characteristic signatures in ribosome footprint sizes.</s></p><p><s>structured non-coding RNAs or large ribonucleoprotein complexes that co-migrate in a sucrose gradient with the ribosome, may be processed with a ribosome profiling library and provide false readouts of translation (see Supplementary information S1 (figure)).</s></p><p><s>A recent approach, termed fragment length organization similarity score (FLOSS) analysis, aims to identify such fragments and remove them post-experimentally (that is, in silic o) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>FLOSS analysis is based on the observation that bona fide ribosome footprints have stereo typical distributions of footprint sizes (see Supplementary information S1 (figure, parts a and b)).</s><s>The distribution of typical 80S footprint sizes used in FLOSS analysis is empirically measured for each experiment, by examining the sizes of footprints in that same experiment from known protein-coding regions, and can be used to computationally identify contaminating fragments for removal.</s><s>Nonetheless, there are examples in which genuine 80S mRNA footprints do not conform to the typical size pattern.</s><s>Two recent cases that highlight interesting biology that was determined by analysis of alternatively sized ribosome footprints indicate effects that are due to both alternative ribosome conformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and alternative mRNA properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> (see below).</s><s>Nuclease protection assays can be a useful adjunct control for identifying the full range of ribosome footprint sizes in a new organism or condition, thus informing the design of a ribosome profiling experiment to best capture all translating ribosome s in a given system.</s><s>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragments commonly result from the nuclease-treatment step of ribosome profiling and may substantially decrease the ribosome footprint sequencing space in a ribosome profiling experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , particularly under conditions in which global translation levels are low.</s><s>Whereas mRNA-seq often uses poly(A) selection as an effective method for the isolation of desired sequences, this approach is not possible with ribosome profiling.</s><s>Selective subtraction of ribosomal fragments, however, is highly effective and is recommended, particularly for samples in which a small number of specific footprint-sized rRNA fragments are seen as contaminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mapping ambiguous reads.</head><p><s>A general challenge in the analysis of sequencing data is determining the correct alignment position for reads from repetitive or highly similar regions, such as gene families, or from alternative transcript variants.</s><s>In the case of genome sequencing or mRNA-seq, longer reads or paired-end <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> approaches can help to resolve such ambiguities, but the inherently short size of ribosome footprints precludes these experimental approaches.</s><s>However, computational methods that have been developed for mRNA-seq data to assign multiply mapping reads in a probabilistic manner on the basis of overall read distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> can be applied to ribosome profiling data to mitigate this limitation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material quantities.</head><p><s>Currently, the main limitation of ribosome profiling compared with mRNA-seq approaches is the requirement for relatively large samples.</s><s>In contrast to mRNA-seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> , ribosome profiling cannot yet be applied to single cells.</s><s>This limitation results from the extra processing step that is required to isolate ribosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , as well as the small proportion of any given mRNA molecule that is being translated at any given instant and thus recoverable as footprints (FIG.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>It is likely that the types of technical advances that have greatly enhanced the sensitivity of RNA-seq approaches to small cell numbers will also be applicable in the future to ribosome profiling, although no such major effort has yet been undertaken.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insights provided by ribosome profiling</head><p><s>With these advantages and disadvantages in mind, the application of ribosome profiling to specific biological questions has confirmed much of what we know about translation mechanism from decades of elegant structural, biochemical and genetic studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>Ribosome profiling has also made it possible to monitor translation with unprecedented depth and precision, providing important -and at times surprising -insights.</s><s>The application of this method to numerous organisms and cellular states has illuminated fundamental aspects of cell biology that were previously challenging to probe experimentally, providing measurements for how much of each protein is synthesized, how translation is regulated, where synthesis starts and stops and what is being synthesized.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How much? A quantitative view of protein synthesis.</head><p><s>The simplest and broadest application of ribosome profiling is as a quantitative proteomics tool to monitor which proteins are being synthesized, and at what levels, thus providing rich molecular insight into a given cell state.</s><s>Ribosome footprint density reflects the number of ribosomes at a given position.</s><s>Assuming that the average translation elongation rate is similar for different genes, ribosome profiling provides direct, global and quantitative measurements of rates of protein synthesis, thereby capturing information that has been largely invisible to gene expression measurements of mRNA levels alone.</s><s>Mass spectrometry can, in principle, be used to measur e rates of protein synthesis; however, this is technically difficult, as it typically requires metabolic labelling and multiple measurements per sample.</s><s>Analysis of the positions of mRNAs in polysome gradients provides valuable complementary information to that obtained with ribosome profiling, but again, this method is laborious and typically yields only a qualitative measure of protein synthesis.</s></p><p><s>In many cases, the ability to observe new protein synthesis globally and quantitatively provides insights that are not apparent from measurements of mRNA abundance.</s><s>Bacterial operons provide a vivid example of the value of being able to directly measure rates of protein synthesis.</s><s>As is the case for many protein complexes in bacteria, the eight different subunits of the F o F 1 -ATP synthase are expressed from a single polycistronic mRNA, and thus measurements of mRNA levels would suggest that the subunits are all expressed at very similar levels.</s><s>Ribosomal profiling, however, shows that the individual ORFs that encode the subunits of the F o F 1 -ATP synthase operon are translated at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:2:3:3:10.</s><s>Remarkably, these ratios precisely reflect the stoichiometry of these components in the ATP synthase <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> (FIG.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>This property of proportional synthesis, by which subunits of multiprotein complexes are synthesized at rates that are proportional to their stoichiometry in the complex, turns out to be generally true for Escherichia coli and was also observed for some (but not all) complexes in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).</s><s>Such measurements of instantaneous rates of protein synthesis may prove to be a general tool for exploring how proteins assemble and function together <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Quantitative measurement of protein synthesis rates over multiple time points of a dynamic process can also provide information about specific gene function.</s><s>For example, hierarchical clustering of patterns of new protein synthesis for each gene over the dynamic process of meiosis in budding yeast resulted in an intricate map of gene expression that provided highly detailed functional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>In these data, the genes responsible for the complex, conserved and meiosis-specific processes of homologous recombination and synaptonemal complex assembly emerged as a single cluster of 46 genes.</s><s>This observation was surprising, because these processes are known to be regulated extensively at the posttranslational level, and also because the cluster included almost every gene that had been found through decades of intensive genetic and cytological screening focused on these processes.</s><s>This cluster also included several uncharacterized genes, two of which (GMC1 and GMC2) were subsequently shown to have roles in recombination and synaptonemal complex formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Another striking recent example of this type of analysis used ribosome profiling to identify the factors that are responsible for initiation of the zygotic

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perspective</head><p><s>Protein synthesis consumes a large proportion of cellular resources and is central to almost every function of a cell.</s><s>Ribosome profiling allows, for the first time, in vivo and global measurement of translation, providing a precise and quantitative account of what cells are translating, how this translation is regulated, and when and where translation happens.</s><s>The rich and quantitative nature of ribosome profiling data provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore and model complex cellular processes.</s></p><p><s>Although it has long been known that translational regulation has important roles in development, in cellular responses to stimuli and in disease, the limited number of well-studied examples of regulation at the level of protein synthesis have generally been identified in an ad hoc manner.</s><s>When paired with RNA-seq measurements of mRNA levels, ribosome profiling now allows instantaneous measurement of all translational control in a given system, providing a tool for broad discovery of the underlying biology of a cellular process or state of choice.</s><s>Furthermore, the detailed information that is yielded by this method provides valuable insight into fundamental aspects of how translation works.</s><s>Despite the conserved nature of much of the translation machinery, important open questions about the mechanism of protein synthesis remain, including the basis for most specificity of translation among different mRNAs and the connections between translation and nascent protein folding.</s></p><p><s>Finally, owing to the precise genomic positional information provided by ribosome profiling, the protein-coding capacity of genomes can now be defined experimentally.</s><s>This has led to the identification of a broad range of non-canonical translation events, including the translation of novel sORFs and alternative forms of previously annotated proteins, thereby challenging traditional views of protein-coding regions and gene diversity.</s><s>Analytical advances that facilitate more comprehensive identification of other non-canonical translation events, such as those resulting from frame-shifting and stop codon read-through will continue to expand our understanding of the protein-coding capacity of complex genomes.</s><s>The functions of the many novel short and alternatively translated regions that have been identified so far by ribosome profiling remain an intriguing and largely open question, the answer to which could fundamentally change the way we think about the encoding of information in genomes.</s><s>Newly available CRISPR-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105</ref> now make it possible to shut down the expression of any transcript <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref> or to introduce nonsense mutations into any ORF.</s><s>As such, these approaches provide a central tool for efforts to define the functional roles of this broad array of newly identified translation products.</s><s>Specialized alterations to ribosome profiling that will advance its use in complex systems include the analysis of subsets of ribosomes, either those associated with specific factors or protein modifications, or those in increasingly specific cell types or subcellular locations.</s><s>Further transformative advances are likely to emerge from progressively more sophisticated and creative analysis of the rich data sets that are generated from ribosome profiling experiments, allowing major surprises to be revealed, even in systems that were thought to be well characterized.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 | An overview of ribosome
