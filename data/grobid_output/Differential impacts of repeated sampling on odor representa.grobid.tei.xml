<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Our major goals were to understand how inhalation frequency affects activity patterns of MTC populations, and to explore differences

artificial-inhalation paradigm to control inhalation frequency in isoflurane-anesthetized mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">DÃ­az-Quesada et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Eiting and Wachowiak, 2018)</ref>.</s><s>To target MCs, protocad-herin21-Cre mice were injected with cre-dependent virus into the aPC to generate expression predominately in piriform-projecting MCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rothermel et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>sTCs were targeted by crossing CCK-IRES-Cre mice with Rosa-GCaMP6f mice (line Ai95D), as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Economo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Short and Wachowiak, 2019)</ref>.</s><s>For each cell type, we lowered the imaging plane to the appropriate depth.</s><s>We gathered MC and sTC responses from populations of cells imaged while presenting clean air and then odorant at different inhalation frequencies (see Materials and Methods).</s><s>We presented eight successive odorant presentations of 8 s duration (interspersed with a 36 s ITI) at each inhalation frequency.</s><s>Example resting fluorescence, activity map, and traces from a MC-cell body imaging experiment show examples of average traces produced from individual trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C-E</ref>).</s><s>In general, variability from trial to trial was small and, as is apparent in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>, tended to be correlated across cells, suggesting a difference in stimulation effectiveness or other global change in excitability rather than variations in cell-specific responses.</s></p><p><s>We first compared responses of MCs and sTCs to repeated sampling of odorant at 1, 3, and 5 Hz.</s><s>Examples of imaging experiments targeted to each cell type are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>, illustrating qualitative differences in how MCs and sTCs respond to repeated sampling, and how these responses change as a function of frequency.</s><s>MCs showed more diverse temporal responses over time that included slower increases in activity peaking over the course of odorant presentation, while sTC responses tended to be simpler, generally following the onset and offset of odorant presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</s><s>sTCs also more commonly followed individual inhalations at 1 Hz than did MCs.</s><s>These trends were evident across the entire population of imaged MCs and sTCs, compiled from seven and five mice, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>Finally, suppressive responses were common in MCs but were rarely observed in sTCs.</s><s>MC responses included a substantial percentage of suppressive cells: 207/655 (32%) cell-odor pairs at 1 Hz, 163/655 (25%) cell-odor pairs at 3 Hz, and 168/655 (26%) cell-odor pairs at 5 Hz were suppressive.</s><s>By contrast there were very few suppressive sTC responses: 23/445 (5%) cell-odor pairs at 1 Hz, 31/445 (7%) cell-odors pairs at 3 Hz, and 24/445 (5%) cell-odor pairs at 5 Hz were suppressive.</s><s>Signals from MC cell bodies using both GCaMP6f (four mice) and GCaMP6s (three mice) showed similar temporal response patterns and prevalence of suppression (not shown), suggesting that the observed differences between MC and sTC populations were likely not due to differences in the temporal dynamics of the calcium indicator used.</s><s>Overall, this suite of differences recapitulates those reported earlier at 2 Hz inhalation frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Economo et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>MCs responded heterogeneously to different inhalation frequencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>For example, cell 3 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> shows no response at 1 Hz inhalation but strong excitation at 5 Hz, while cell four switches response polarity from excitation at 1 and 3 Hz to suppression at 5 Hz.</s><s>Neighboring cells also show different responses to repeated sampling of the same odorant.</s><s>For example, cell 3 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> (mentioned above) can be contrasted with its neighbor, cell 5, which responds fairly consistently across all three inhalation frequencies.</s><s>Across the MC population, cells switched response polarity from suppressed to excited roughly three to four times as frequently as excited to suppressed: 49/438 (11%) excited to suppressed from 1 to 3 Hz, 64/438 (15%) excited to suppressed from 1 to 5 Hz, 84/217 (39%) suppressed to excited from 1 to 3 Hz, and 111/217 (51%) suppressed to excited from 1 to 5 Hz (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>MCs also became more excitable with increasing inhalation frequencies: more cells responded to greater numbers of odorants at 3 and 5 Hz compared with 1 Hz (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, sTCs typically responded similarly to all three inhalation frequencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>), although more sTCs responded to greater numbers of odorants at higher frequencies.</s><s>In many cells a decrease in excitation suggesting adaptation was apparent with repeated sampling at higher frequencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>, cells 4 and 5).</s><s>Changes in response polarity in sTCs were much rarer compared with MCs: 22/402 (5%) switched from excited to suppressed responses when comparing 1-3 Hz, and 17/402 (4%) switched from excited to suppressed in the 1 to 5 Hz case.</s><s>Furthermore, while only 5-7% of sTCs showed suppressive responses to 1 Hz inhalation, nearly half of these cells switched polarity from suppression to excitation when inhalation frequency increased to 3 Hz (39%; 9/23 cells) or 5 Hz (61%; 14/23 cells).</s><s>These differences between MCs and sTCs were likely not due to differences in frequency-dependent excitability, as sTCs showed a similar pattern to MCs of cells become more excitable with increasing inhalation frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>Overall, these analyses indicate that MCs and sTCs show distinct impacts of inhalation frequency on responses to repeated odorant inhalation, but that across both cell types, as inhalation frequency increased, cells tended to switch from suppression to excitation much more frequently than from excitation to suppression.</s></p><p><s>Heterogeneity in MC (and to a lesser extent sTC) responses implies that neural representations of odor identity, measured in terms of spike rate across each population, will change as a function of repeated odor sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Patterson et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">DÃ­az-Quesada et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Example experimental preparations in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>,B show how populations of cells [MCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) and sTCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>)] change over an 8 s odorant presentation at 1 and 5 Hz inhalation.</s><s>In the MC example, numerous cell bodies changed their response polarity or their response amplitude across the 8 s odorant period, and this shift occurred more often at higher inhalation frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, in the sTC example, very few cells switched their response polarity, or even changed their activity level appreciably, regardless of inhalation frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To quantify changes among populations of MCs and sTCs, we correlated the population response to an odorant at a given time point to the population response at the first time point (corresponding to the first inhalation at 1 Hz; for precise times, see Materials and Methods) over the length of odorant presentation.</s><s>This analysis was performed separately for each ensemble of MCs or sTCs imaged in the same FOV (n = 13-58 MCs and 10-43 sTCs per

pattern was relatively high at 1 Hz (r = 0.72 6 0.29, mean 6 SD), with lower correlation values at higher inhalation frequencies (3 Hz, r = 0.63 6 0.37; 5 Hz, r = 0.61 6 0.37).</s><s>These differences across frequency were not statistically significant, however (n = 7 mice, Mann-Whitney U test, 1 vs 3 Hz, p = 0.30; 1 vs 5 Hz, p = 0.71), due to the relative high variance in the degree of decorrelation for different fields of view (see below).</s><s>Nonetheless this result for MCs contrasts with that for sTCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>), which maintained highly similar response patterns over the 8-s odor duration, with correlations to the initial response of r = 0.90 6 0.07 in the 1 Hz case, 0.89 6 0.02 at 3 Hz, and 0.81 6 0.12 at 5 Hz (n = 5 mice).</s><s>Regardless of inhalation frequency, MCs decorrelated significantly more over the 8 s compared with sTCs (correlation coefficients in final time bin for all frequencies, two sample t test,

observed between MC and sTC populations were not a result of different GCaMP reporters; in subsequent analyses, we combined data from both variants.</s><s>Overall, this analysis shows that MC responses show more decorrelation in response patterns with repeated sampling than do sTCs, and suggests that higher inhalation frequencies may drive greater decorrelation in the MC population.</s><s>Linear decorrelation in population response patterns could arise from systematic changes in MC (or sTC) responsiveness.</s><s>Such changes could include, for example, increases in excitation that saturate at the high end of a cell's dynamic range or rise above threshold at the low end, or decreases in excitation that have the opposite effects.</s><s>Alternatively, decorrelation could result from distinct effects of repeated sampling in different cells.</s><s>To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the change in MC or sTC excitation over the course of the odorant presentation, expressed as the change in DF/F from the first to the last second of the presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</s><s>There was substantial heterogeneity in the effect of repeated sampling on excitation, reflected as a large variance across cells in the change in DF/F (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</s><s>Across all cells analyzed and all inhalation frequencies, there was a significant net increase in DF/F from the first to the last second, although the magnitude of the difference was small relative to the variance across different cells (Wilcoxon sign-ranked

significantly more than at 1 or 5 Hz inhalation frequencies (Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons, p , 0.00001 for both 1 vs 3 Hz and 3 vs 5 Hz).</s><s>These results are consistent with the idea that cells respond to repeated sampling with a net increase in excitability over the duration of the odorant presentation.</s></p><p><s>We next asked whether increasing inhalation frequency systematically impacted MC or sTC excitability within a given cell, either initially (i.e., in the first second) or after prolonged sampling (i.e., after 8 s).</s><s>To test this, we compared response

late 3 Hz MCs vs late 3 Hz sTCs, and so on; p , 0.05 in all cases).</s><s>Together, these results indicate that, while increasing inhalation frequency modestly enhances net excitation, repeated odorant sampling reorganizes MC and sTC responses differently.</s><s>In particular, sTCs show an increase in excitation that affects all sTCs similarly, whereas MCs respond to increasing inhalation frequencies with a more modest increase in excitability, but more pronounced differentiation among individual cells.</s></p><p><s>Reformatting of the population responses among MCs could be a result of changes across all cells, or it could occur across only a subset of cells depending on their initial response to the odorant.</s><s>To differentiate between these possibilities we broke the datasets into groups of strongly responding, weakly responding, and suppressive cells based on their response within the first second of odor presentation (see Materials and Methods); each group had roughly equivalent numbers of cells overall [average strongly-excited cells: 10 (1 Hz), 10 (3 Hz), 11 (5 Hz); weakly excited cells: 9 (1 Hz), 10 (3 Hz), 10 (5 Hz); suppressive cells: 9 (1 Hz), 8 (3

the correlation-to-early plots as done previously (compare with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>Removing strongly excited MCs from the population appeared to eliminate frequency-dependent differences in the degree of decorrelation (compare Figs. <ref type="figure">4C,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>However, sampling-dependent decorrelation persisted after removal of each MC subgroup (strongly-excited, weakly-excited and suppressed MCs; Fig. <ref type="figure">4C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>), with no significant differences in the
