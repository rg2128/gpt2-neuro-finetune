relationship is generated because of a simple reason: when a pre-FR below the mean FR is drawn from the distribution, the odor FR randomly drawn from the same distribution is more likely to be above the pre-FR (and vice versa).</s><s>Thus, if we had chosen to perform the analysis of the ⌬FR versus pre-FR relationship, we would have to limit the analysis to the SU-odorant pairs whose FR is stable
