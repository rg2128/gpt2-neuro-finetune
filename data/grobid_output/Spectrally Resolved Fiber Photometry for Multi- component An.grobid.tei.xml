<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Owing to the recent advances in genetically encoded fluorescent sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dana et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li and Tsien, 2012)</ref>, in vivo fiber photometry, a class of optical recording methods that use optical fibers to deliver excitation light and collect fluorescence emission photons, has become an increasingly popular tool for assessing a variety of cellular events from specific types of cells in deep brain circuits of freely moving animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cui et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gunaydin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kim et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Simultaneous multi-color fiber photometry using two or more fluorescent sensors is a highly desirable approach, as it provides the capability to monitor multiple cellular and molecular events in action at the same time.</s><s>However, current fiber photometry systems are not ideal for multi-color measurements, because they either lack a light-dispersing mechanism to capture the fluorescence emission spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gunaydin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kim et al., 2016)</ref> or are limited in spectral span and spectral resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cui et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cui et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Spectral information is pivotal for the application of fiber photometry methods in the measurement of multi-color fluorescence, as it is required for correct signal identification and accurate signal unmixing when using fluorophores with overlapped emission spectra (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>In this study, we designed a novel spectrally resolved fiber photometry system that can be used for high-speed simultaneous measurement of multiple fluorophores between the UV (350 nm) and IR (1100 nm) range.</s><s>To demonstrate the functionality of this new system, and to reveal the relationship between the two parallel projection pathways in the basal ganglia in movement control <ref type="bibr">(Albin et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gerfen et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011)</ref>, we sought to record the fluorescence from green and red genetically encoded Ca 2+ indicators (GECIs) GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a differentially expressed in striatal direct-and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in freely moving mice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spectrally resolved fiber photometry system for unmixing of multiple fluorescence signals</head><p><s>The fiber photometry system consists of three major components: an excitation light source, a fluorescence cube with interchangeable filters and a spectrometer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>, see STAR Methods for detailed parts list).</s><s>To simultaneously measure green and red fluorophores, we used a 488 nm continuous wave (CW) laser and a 561 nm CW laser as the excitation light sources and a set of matching dual band dichroic and emission filters.</s><s>The high performance spectrometer is equipped with a diffraction grating as the light dispersing device and a cooled back-thinned linear CCD array as the detector.</s></p><p><s>To address the concern that the overlapped portion of the GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a spectra may confound the explanation of the obtained results (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), and to demonstrate the advantage of spectral unmixing in multi-fluorescence measurements, we co-expressed GCaMP6f and control red fluorescent protein tdTomato, whose emission spectrum largely overlaps with jRGECO1a (tdTomato emission peak: 584 nm, jRGECO1a emission peak: 600 nm, measured in vivo, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1F</ref>), in striatal SPNs, and measured intracortical stimulation-evoked striatal responses in anesthetized mice.</s><s>We found that intracortical electrical stimulation produced a large increase in GCaMP6f fluorescence, and, at the same time, also caused an apparent increase in the tdTomato fluorescence due to the spectral bleed-through (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, D).</s><s>To correct for the artifact in the tdTomato fluorescence change (and therefore the potential red sensors to be used), we applied a linear unmixing algorithm (see STAR Methods for details) and used the coefficients of GCaMP6f and tdTomato produced by the model to represent the changes in their fluorescence intensity, which effectively corrected the artifact caused by the spectral bleed-through (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, we used the unmixed coefficients over time to represent the dynamic fluorescence intensity changes of individual fluorophores throughout the rest of the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validation of GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a as neural activity reporters in striatal SPNs</head><p><s>To test if the GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a fluorescence signals recorded by the photometry system can faithfully report the neural activity in freely moving animals, we performed in vivo recordings when GCaMP6f was co-expressed with tdTomato (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-C</ref>), and when jRGECO1a was co-expressed with eGFP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>-G, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1F</ref>) in striatal SPNs.</s><s>We observed frequent and transient increases only in GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a fluorescence but not in the corresponding tdTomato and eGFP fluorescence (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>, H), suggesting that the fluorescence transients in GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a were caused by Ca 2+ influx associated with neural activity and were not movement related artifacts.</s></p><p><s>Since GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a have been shown to have different sensitivity, dynamic range and kinetics in detecting action potential (AP) associated cytosolic Ca 2+ increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dana et al., 2016)</ref>, we further tested if GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a can report neural activity with comparable temporal profiles and magnitude changes by coexpressing them in the same population of striatal SPNs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A-C</ref>).</s><s>We found that GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a signals showed high temporal correlation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>, E), and that the normalized changes in the magnitude of these two sensors, expressed either as the percent change of coefficient (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>) or the Z scores (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>), displayed a linear relationship in freely moving animals.</s><s>These results built the foundation for us to use the GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a together to report the neural activities in striatal direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs.</s><s>Since the slope of the fitting curve is closer to 1 when Z score is used to represent the normalized magnitude than when percent change is used, which could partially compensate for the innate differences in the dynamic range of GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a, we chose to use the Z scores to represent the magnitude of normalized fluorescence transients when GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a are used together.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural activities are highly synchronized between direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs</head><p><s>To differentially express GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a in striatal direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs, we infused Cre-off GCaMP6f (FAS-GCaMP6f) and Cre-on jRGECO1a (DIO-jRGECO1a) viral vectors into the striatum of D1-Cre mice, so that GCaMP6f would be expressed by indirect-pathway SPNs while jRGECO1a would be expressed by directpathway SPNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gerfen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gong et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Saunders et al., 2012)</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Immunostainings for GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a confirmed clear separation of these two sensors in different populations of striatal neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>The nearly exclusive expression of GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a by projection neurons within the two striatal pathways was further shown by their absence in the cholinergic interneurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A-C</ref>).</s><s>In freely moving mice, we found that the fluorescence of GCaMP6f in indirect-pathway SPNs and the jRGECO1a in direct-pathway SPNs showed highly synchronized changes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C-E</ref>).</s><s>This same observation was also made when we swapped sensors between the two pathways by using Cre-on GCaMP6f (DIO-GCaMP6f) and Cre-off jRGECO1a (FAS-jRGECO1a) viral vectors in D1-Cre mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F-J</ref>), and when we used the Cre-on and Cre-off viral vectors in A2A-Cre mice to direct the expression of the two sensors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2D-M</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, when we used two fiber photometry systems or a modified dual-spectrometer system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>) to simultaneously measure the striatal direct-and indirect-pathway neural activities bilaterally (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>), we found that, although the neural activities were highly synchronized between the direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs in the same hemisphere, the activation in one striatum was always accompanied by a lack of activation in the contralateral striatum (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>-F), consistent with previous studies showing that the striatal neural activity is associated with contraversive but not ipsiversive movements in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cui et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tecuapetla et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The magnitude of activation in direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs collaboratively determines the movement patterns</head><p><s>Although the neural activities in direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs were temporally synchronized, the magnitude of activation at each activation event was often different between the two pathways.</s><s>To reveal the relationship between the animal's locomotor behavior and the magnitude of the activation in direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs, we used the x-y coordinates of the animal's head and body to create a vector to represent the animal's location and orientation at a given time point, and used the cumulative angle between the vectors to describe the animal's turning behavior (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>).</s><s>To test if different magnitudes of activation in direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs lead to different movement patterns, we examined the events where one pathway showed larger magnitude of activation than the other and plotted the cumulative angle 0.5 sec before and 1.0 sec after the onset of the selected event (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>).</s><s>The onset of an event was defined by a Z score value that is larger than mean plus 3 times the standard deviation of the Z scores of recorded fluorescence during the previous 0.5 sec period.</s><s>We found that in the events when the direct-pathway SPNs showed strong activation and the indirect-pathway SPNs showed weak activation, the animal was able to initiate and complete large contraversive turning movements (events b, c, d in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>, C, Movie S1).</s><s>When the direct-pathway SPNs showed weak activation and the indirect-pathway SPNs showed strong activation, the animal was also able to initiate contraversive turning movements; however, the movements were terminated immediately after the initiation (events a and e in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>, C, Movie S2).</s></p><p><s>Since GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a have different dynamic ranges in detecting neural activity related Ca 2+ fluctuations, we counterbalanced the way these two sensors were expressed in direct-and indirect-pathway SPNs.</s><s>When we pooled the data from eight mice (5 mice with GCaMP6f expressed in the direct pathway and jRGECO1a in the indirect pathway, and 3 mice with the reversed order) and compared the animal's turning behavior, we found that the cumulative contraversive turning degrees measured at 1.5 s after the onset of the fluorescence transients were significantly larger in the events when strong activation in direct-pathway neurons was paired with weak activation in indirect-pathway neurons <ref type="bibr">(cum-degrees=96.24±4.62, n=52)</ref> than in the events when weak activation in direct-pathway neurons was paired with strong activation in indirect-pathway neurons (cum-degrees=37.22±2.36,</s><s>n=51) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref>, P&lt;0.0001, unpaired t-test).</s><s>We further analyzed the results separately based on which pathways the sensors were expressed in.</s><s>When GCaMP6f was expressed in direct-pathway SPNs and jRGECO1a expressed in indirect-pathway SPNs, the cumulative turning degrees were significantly larger in the events with strong direct pathway activation and weak indirect pathway activation (cum-degrees=95.28±7.02,</s><s>GCaMP6f Z score=4.359±0.372,</s><s>jRGECO1a Z score=2.502±0.268,</s><s>n=34, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E</ref>) than in the events with weak direct pathway activation and strong indirect pathway activation (cum-degrees=46.42±8.56,</s><s>GCaMP6f Z score=1.915±0.261,</s><s>jRGECO1a Z score=3.651±0.368,</s><s>n=18, P&lt;0.0001, unpaired t-test between cum-degrees, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6H</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were also seen when the sensors were reversed in these two pathways.</s><s>The cumulative turning degrees were larger in the events with strong direct pathway activation and weak indirect pathway activation (cum-degrees=100.7±8.06,</s><s>jRGECO1a Z score=3.311±0.303,</s><s>GCaMP6f Z score=1.621±0.255,</s><s>n=18, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6F</ref>) than in the events with weak direct pathway activation and strong indirect pathway activation (cum-degrees=24.99±7.46,</s><s>jRGECO1a Z score=1.455±0.204,</s><s>GCaMP6f Z score=3.705±0.456,</s><s>n=33, P&lt;0.0001, unpaired t-test between cum-degrees, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6I</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These results suggest that strong direct-pathway activation combined with weak indirectpathway activation leads to 'start and go' type of contraversive movements featured with large turning angles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6G</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, weak direct-pathway activation with strong indirect-pathway activation leads to 'start and stop' type of movements featured by an abrupt termination of the contraversive movements (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6J</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>A unique feature of the fiber photometry system that we have described in this study is its capability of obtaining high resolution emission spectrum from multiple fluorescent sensors or proteins.</s><s>This feature is crucial for verifying that the emission photons collected through each band of the emission filter are indeed from the expressed fluorescent sensors or proteins (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>It is also required for subsequent mathematical extraction of each spectral component from the measured mixed spectrum, which is essential for eliminating the signal cross-contaminations caused by spectral bleed-through of multiple fluorescent sensors and proteins (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Another feature of the system is its high versatility.</s><s>By choosing different light sources and appropriate fluorescence filter sets, variable versions can be derived from the same core design to measure different fluorophores of interest and to manage the total cost of the system.</s><s>For example, LEDs and mercury arc lamps can be used as alternative excitation light sources to significantly reduce the cost.</s><s>A large selection of commercial multiband filter sets is available for simultaneous measurement of multiple fluorophores with different colors.</s><s>The system is easy to assemble from all commercially available parts by a person with a basic knowledge of optics.</s><s>It can be broadly applied in studying a variety of other cellular and molecular processes, such as intracellular signal transduction, cell metabolism and redox state <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Klarenbeek et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lukyanov and Belousov, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tao et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An important prerequisite for achieving multi-sensor measurements in different populations of neurons is to have the proper molecular tools to deliver the fluorescent sensors into specific types of neurons.</s><s>In this study, we adopted the Cre-on and Cre-off AAV vector strategy to target striatal direct-and indirect-pathway neurons, because these projection neurons constitute 90-95% of total neuronal populations in the striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Saunders et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This targeting strategy is only applicable for brain regions that are dominated by two molecularly distinct neuronal populations.</s><s>A more specific strategy that can be broadly applied to all brain regions is to combine promoter-specific Cre and Flpo mouse driver lines with DIO and fDIO AAV vectors when they have become more widely available <ref type="bibr">(Fenno et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Madisen et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A potential problem that may limit the use of the fluorescent sensors and confound the explanation of the results is the fading of fluorescence during long periods of illumination.</s><s>To test whether the method described in this study is suitable for longer experiments, we carried out additional experiments in mice expressing GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a in two striatal pathways.</s><s>We used intracortical electrical stimulations delivered every minute to evoke striatal responses, and compared the magnitude of evoked responses in GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a fluorescence over a period of 40 minutes.</s><s>We found that despite the decay of fluorescence intensity in both GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a (more severe in jRGECO1a) over the 40-min recording session (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref>, B), the magnitude (Z score) of the stimulationevoked fluorescence transients in GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a remained constant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4C</ref>, D), suggesting that the baseline fluorescence drop did not cause severe distortion of the reported values when using the dynamic fluorescence change of these Ca 2+ sensors to report the neural activity.</s><s>Interestingly, we also found that the faded fluorescence could fully recover to the initial intensity when measured the next day (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref>), suggesting that the fluorescence fading we observed was mainly caused by photoswitching <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dana et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Shaner et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The role of striatal direct and indirect pathways in movement control has recently been examined using opto-and chemo-genetic manipulations and optogenetic recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barbera et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cui et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ferguson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kravitz et al.)</ref>.</s><s>However, the temporal profile and the magnitude of activation in these two pathways have never been directly compared in the same animals.</s><s>Using the spectrally resolved fiber photometry method with differentially expressed GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a, our study provides the first set of evidence to reveal that the activities in direct and indirect pathways are highly synchronized within each hemisphere (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2D-M</ref>), and that the striatal neural activities are desynchronized between the two hemispheres (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>These results are consistent with previous findings that both direct-and indirect-pathway neurons show strong activation when the animals turn contraversively but not ipsiversively <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cui et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The observed synchrony between the direct and indirect pathways is not surprising, because the corticostriatal inputs that innervate direct-and indirect-pathway neurons are highly overlapped <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kress et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Since the information that flows through the indirect pathway has one or two more synaptic delays at the level of globus pallidus external segment and the subthalamic nucleus than the direct pathway, concurrent activation of these two pathways at the striatum level will produce an inherent temporal delay when these two pathways converge at the output nuclei of the basal ganglia.</s><s>This temporal delay makes it impossible for the indirect-pathway neurons to directly antagonize the effect of direct pathway activation during action initiation.</s></p><p><s>The most important finding revealed by our method is that the magnitude of activation in direct-and indirect-pathway neurons collaboratively determines the movement dynamics and fate.</s><s>In the events when the direct-pathway neurons showed strong activation paired with a weak activation in the indirect-pathway neurons, the animals were able to complete a large contraversive turn and move to a distant location (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, Movie S1).</s><s>However, in the events when the indirect-pathway neurons showed strong activation, the initiated contraversive movements were abruptly terminated, and the animals would either pause in the same location or initiate an ipsiversive movement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, Movie S2).</s><s>Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the direct pathway activation serves as a movement start signal, and its magnitude determines the vigor of a movement.</s><s>Meanwhile, the concurrently activated indirect pathway serves as a scalable stop signal that determines whether the initiated movement will continue or be terminated.</s><s>Our hypothesis is based on correlational observations described in this study.</s><s>The causal relationship between the neural activity and behavior needs to be further examined by interventional studies where direct-and indirectpathway SPNs are independently controlled to recapitulate different activation scenarios in vivo.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have developed a novel spectrometer-based fiber photometry method for simultaneous multi-color fluorescent signal measurement and unmixing from deep brain structures in vivo.</s><s>Using this method, we show for the first time that the neural activities of two parallel striatal projection pathways are highly synchronized, and the magnitude of activation in these two pathways collaboratively determines the dynamics and fate of movement.</s></p></div>
