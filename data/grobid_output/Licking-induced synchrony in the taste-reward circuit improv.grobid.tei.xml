<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral task</head><p><s>All experiments were performed in an operant box that contained two widely spaced (ϳ17 cm) drinking compartments.</s><s>Each compartment contained a photobeam lickometer (MED Associates) that was used to register each lick.</s><s>The sipper tube was composed of a bundle of 12 20gauge stainless-steel tubes cemented together in a larger steel tube (inner diameter, 7.5 mm), connected to solenoid valves <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Stapleton et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Each solution was maintained under air pressure to ensure a single delivery of a ϳ20 l drop of liquid (in 10 ms).</s><s>Access to each compartment was restricted with a sliding door operated with a hydraulic pump.</s><s>The behavioral task and details about the quantification of learning are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, before surgery, all rats were trained on the taste discrimination task.</s><s>A trial began when the door opened allowing access to the cue compartment.</s><s>Rats were then allowed to lick the tube and received a drop of water at the fourth lick.</s><s>Rats were required to continue licking the dry sipper five additional times and on the sixth lick, they received a cue consisting of a drop of either 0.1 M NaCl or 0.1 M monopotassium L-glutamate (MPG).</s><s>These two tastants were chosen because rodents can distinguish between them independently of sodium content <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Maruyama et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>In the first session, one of these tastants was randomly chosen as either the positive (Cϩ) or negative (CϪ) cue.</s><s>After cue delivery, access to the outcome compartment was allowed, and, although no more licks were required, rats continued licking, on average, 1.2 s before moving to the outcome port.</s><s>Rats had 10 s after cue delivery to move from the cue compartment to the outcome compartment, where after three empty licks they could receive the signaled outcome.</s><s>If after 10 s no response was observed, both doors closed, thereby terminating the trial.</s><s>In the outcome compartment, the positive cue (Cϩ) was associated with three deliveries of 0.4 M sucrose and the negative cue (CϪ) signaled the availability of up to three deliveries of 1 mM QHCl (quinine hydrochloride).</s></p><p><s>Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref> A (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) shows a schematic representation of the behavioral strategies used to solve the task.</s><s>In our go/no-go task, water-deprived animals initially adopt a behavioral strategy that favors responding to both cues with a "go" response ("always go behavioral strategy").</s><s>Note that, at the beginning of the session, the predictive value of either of the cues is unknown to the rat, thus exploring the outcomes of both cues with a go response will provide them with the experience needed to learn which cue predicts a reward (sucrose) and which predicts punishment (quinine).</s><s>After several trials in which learning had taken place, rats switched to a discriminative behavioral response pattern, in which they respond to CϪ cue by withholding a go response (correctly avoiding quinine), whereas rats maintained making a go response to Cϩ cue.</s><s>Rats respond correctly for nearly 100% of the Cϩ trials throughout the entire session (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref> B, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>Therefore, since both trials types are intermingled, it is not until the rat starts to avoid quinine that it is possible to know from a behavioral viewpoint that the rat has learned that the Cϩ predicts sucrose.</s><s>Indeed, rats that do not learn aborted the task and kept drinking for the cues but stopped making a go response or simply stopped working.</s><s>For this reason, we used both cues to obtain the "learning trial" (for definition, see below, Behavioral analysis of learning) (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6C</ref>,D, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>This initial training was followed by serial reversal training in which the response contingencies of the tastants were reversed.</s><s>Once the rats learned the new contingency (usually after one or two extra sessions covering 2 or more days), subsequent reversals were issued.</s><s>Electrode implantation did not occur until at least three complete reversal cycles were learned.</s><s>Therefore, animals were familiar with the taste discrimination task and with the tastants used as cues, but after each reversal they unlearned or suppressed previous cue-outcome contingencies so that their behavior could dynamically adapt to the new task rules.</s></p><p><s>During the recordings, the animal's behavioral performance was analyzed online.</s><s>If the state space algorithm (described below) determined that the subject learned, the trials were subdivided into prelearning and postlearning phases.</s><s>Furthermore, if in the postlearning phase a stable performance was observed (defined as correct performance Ͼ80% during at least 60 -100 trials), then another within-session reversal was issued.</s><s>This training protocol continued as long as quality recordings were obtained.</s><s>In these later sessions, however, rats unlearned the original meaning of the cues but never, in the same session, exhibited a complete reversal.</s><s>The results from the within-session reversal are not presented in this manuscript.</s><s>However, we note that the changes in the postlearning epoch described in this manuscript were significantly reduced in a few trials after the within-session reversal (our unpublished results).</s></p><p><s>Since rats in these experiments were trained in a continuous serialreversal task, we note that our operant definition of "prelearning" and "postlearning" phases refers specifically to the collection of trials before and after the learning trial (see definition below).</s><s>Thus, this definition does not imply occurrence of learning of a "novel" cue-pair association.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral analysis of learning</head><p><s>We used a state-space algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Smith et al., 2004)</ref> to determine within a single session the occurrence of a learning trial.</s><s>Briefly, this algorithm modeled learning as a dynamic process from the time series of binary responses across trials, where "0" represents an incorrect response and "1" represents a correct response.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Smith et al. (2004)</ref> demonstrated that this method estimates the learning curve and its confidence interval more accurately and earlier than several currently accepted methods (i.e., the moving average method).</s><s>In the state-space algorithm, the learning trial is defined as the first trial in which, from the point of view of an ideal observer (that is, one that has knowledge of the performance throughout the entire session), there is a reasonable certainty (95% confidence) that the subject is performing above chance level and that correct performance will be maintained for the rest of the session (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1 B</ref> <ref type="bibr">, right)</ref>.</s><s>In this model, the learning curve (confidence interval) and certainty were estimated using the expectation maximization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Smith et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>However, this algorithm does not treat learning as a gradual process but rather as a statistical event.</s><s>In this regard, the learning trial does not mean that learning occurred on that particular trial, but rather it reflects the trial at which there is sufficient evidence that the subject began performing above chance level and from which its correct performance remained for the rest of the session.</s></p><p><s>The sequence of correct and incorrect behavioral responses was obtained following the standard nomenclature; a correct trial is composed of both "hit" and "correct rejection" trial types.</s><s>(A hit is when Cϩ is delivered and the subject makes a go response and drinks at least one drop of sucrose.</s><s>A correct rejection occurs when CϪ is delivered and the subject withholds a go response to avoid punishment, quinine HCl.)</s><s>An incorrect trial comprises the pool of "false alarms" and "miss" trials types.</s><s>A false alarm occurs when CϪ is followed by a go response, meaning the subject will drink at least one drop of quinine.</s><s>A miss occurs when Cϩ is followed by a no-go response, and the subject will not receive the sucrose reward.</s><s>By using these definitions, together with this algorithm, a quantitative estimate of the learning trial was obtained (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1 B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s><s>In this task, from the first lick in the cue compartment, the mean intertrial interval was 24.5 Ϯ 1.2 s.</s><s>On average, a single session lasts for 70.9 Ϯ 5.4 min, and rats achieved the learning trial in 16.2 Ϯ 1.3 min.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analyses</head><p><s>All data analysis was performed using MatLab and R. Unless otherwise indicated, we used the SEM.</s></p><p><s>Coherence.</s><s>Multitaper spectral analysis and coherence were computed by segmenting two univariate binned point processes (licking and spike PSTHs) into chunks <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jarvis and Mitra, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>The coherence ( C) between licking and the spike trains was computed using the following formula: C( f ) ϭ I xy /͌(I xx I yy ), where I xx represents the spectrum of licking behavior, I yy is the spectrum of neuronal activity, and I xy is the cross-spectrum of licking and spike spectrum.</s><s>Note that the coherence ( C) is normalized to range between 0 and 1.</s><s>Finally, f is the frequency where coherence was computed (4 -10 Hz).</s><s>This frequency band corresponds to that normally observed in freely licking behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Spector et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>The confidence interval of the coherence, C( f ), and significance threshold (at ␣ of 0.05%) were computed with a jackknife method and finite size corrections using the procedures developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jarvis and Mitra (2001)</ref>.</s><s>A neuron was classified as licking-coherent only if its lower confidence interval (95%) crossed the significance threshold.</s><s>Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref> (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) shows an example of coherence calculation in a single neuron.</s><s>Each chunk of data corresponded to the first lick in the cue port up to 2.5 s of activity.</s><s>This time essentially represents the entire period that rats licked the sipper tube in the cue compartment (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>The maximum coherence value and frequency were computed using the Chronux 1.50 software package (www.chronux.org).</s><s>Multitaper coherence was also computed cycle-by-cycle in windows of 170 ms aligned to each lick in the cue compartment (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>; supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>, available at www. jneurosci.org</s><s>as supplemental material).</s><s>This window is large enough to observe theta rhythm.</s><s>Tapers 1 and 2 were used for this analysis, as were frequencies between 0 and 60 Hz (supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref> A, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>In Figure <ref type="figure">9C</ref>, we determined whether after cue (AC) cue-selective cells were licking coherent; thus, we used a single window from 0.2 to 1 s after cue delivery.</s><s>In the postlearning phase, both Cϩ and CϪ trials were combined.</s></p><p><s>Cross-correlation analysis.</s><s>In this analysis, a neuron from one region was compared with a neuron simultaneously recorded in a different brain area.</s><s>For instance, if two licking-coherent neurons were recorded in OFC, three in AMY, and two in IC, then there were six OFC-AMY pairs, four OFC-IC pairs, and six AMY-IC pairs.</s><s>The variability in the response of each neuron to repeated presentations of the same stimulus was removed by subtracting the shift predictor from the raw crosscorrelation.</s><s>The shift predictor was constructed by shuffling the trials of one neuron (reference cell), this procedure was repeated 100 times, and the average cross-correlation values were subtracted from the original raw cross-correlations.</s><s>Then, the absolute peak value of this crosscorrelation was identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Grossman et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Phasic, before cue, and after cue responses.</s><s>Neuronal firing modulations shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> were identified using a Wilcoxon rank sum test at an ␣ level of Ͻ0.05.</s></p><p><s>Phasic responses.</s><s>Phasic neuronal firing modulations were identified using a Wilcoxon rank sum test at an ␣ level of Ͻ0.05.</s><s>Briefly, the spike counts over the first 150 ms after cue delivery were compared against the neuronal firing produced during the 150 ms after a previous empty lick.</s><s>In cases in which the interlick interval of the previous lick overlapped with cue delivery, the next to last dry lick before the cue delivery was used as the baseline.</s><s>This approach determined whether cue delivery evoked a significant neuronal response relative to that produced by an empty lick, thus providing a rationale to separate oromotor-driven firing modulations from genuine taste cue-evoked neuronal activity (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine whether the neurons responsive to the delivery of the cues were also responsive to other gustatory stimuli (e.g., water, sucrose, quinine), we followed the same procedure outlined above for the cues, namely by calculating the differences in activity between the wet and dry licks.</s><s>This criterion allowed us to test whether neurons responded to other gustatory stimuli, but not whether these evoked responses were significantly different among gustatory stimuli (supplemental Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s><s>It is important to emphasize that in the present study we did not explore the contribution of a temporal code (in 150 ms), which has been shown to also carry taste information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Di Lorenzo and Victor, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stapleton et al., 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Before cue responses.</s><s>Neurons with excitatory activity before cue (BC) delivery were identified using a Wilcoxon rank sum test at an ␣ level of Ͻ0.05.</s><s>Neurons with this firing pattern had to meet two selection criteria: (1) they needed to show a significant inhibition during the first lick after cue delivery.</s><s>Thus, we compared the spike counts over the first 150 ms after cue delivery against the firing rate produced during 150 ms after a previous empty lick.</s><s>(2) The spike counts over the first 500 ms before cue delivery had to be significantly greater than the firing rate in the subsequent 500 ms after cue delivery.</s></p><p><s>After cue responses.</s><s>Neurons that fired after cue delivery were also identified using a Wilcoxon rank sum test at an ␣ level of Ͻ0.05.</s><s>These neurons showed a significant increase in firing rate during the first second after cue delivery, in comparison with the second before cue delivery.</s><s>Neurons that showed phasic activity [upon cue (UC) responses] were not included in this category.</s><s>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, both AC and BC neurons were ranked according to the root mean square of their firing rate.</s></p><p><s>Onset and peak latency.</s><s>The onset and peak latency were computed from perievent stimulus histograms (PSTHs) (bin width, 1 ms) using a 200 ms window after cue delivery.</s><s>The PSTHs were smoothed through convolution with a Gaussian function with a SD of 10 ms.</s><s>The onset latency was defined as the first bin exceeding 3 SDs above background activity.</s><s>The onset latency and average peak time are displayed as a function of cue type, learning phase, and brain area in supplemental Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).</s></p><p><s>Generalized linear model.</s><s>It is generally accepted that neuronal firing rates follow a Poisson distribution.</s><s>Therefore to determine whether spiking activity discriminated between cues in each learning phase, the spike counts were modeled using a Poisson generalized linear model <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Stapleton et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The generalized linear model (GLM) is more appropriate to use than a two-way ANOVA test, which assumes the spike trains are normally distributed.</s><s>Details of the Poisson GLM model can be found in supplemental Methods, Data analyses, GLM (available at www.jneurosci.</s><s>org as supplemental
