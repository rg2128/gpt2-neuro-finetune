<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphological basis of niche divergence</head><p><s>A large number of phenotypic traits contribute to niche score variation.</s><s>To determine this we measured nine functional morphological traits that play important roles in prey capture and retention, including craniofacial traits affecting the capacity to generate suction pressure, the speed and extent of jaw protrusion, and the retention of ingested prey items (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s><s>We additionally measured the x-and y-coordinates of 19 morphological landmarks indicating body and head shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>), which are expected to influence feeding performance.</s><s>We used all-subsets linear regression to test effects of functional morphological traits and body shape coordinates, separately, on niche score.</s><s>The best functional trait models (0 ‚â§ ŒîAIC ‚â§ 2) fitting niche score contained terms for three of the five components of the suction feeding index <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , two key oral jaw traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , and both gill raker counts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The best models fitting niche score to body shape contained terms for 22 of 38 landmark coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</s><s>Hereafter, we consider the traits included in the best models to be 'component traits' of niche divergence between Paxton benthics and limnetics.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic architecture of niche divergence</head><p><s>We conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping on all measured morphological traits and found 76 significant QTL, including 41 QTL for 19 of the 29 component traits.</s><s>The QTL exhibit small-to moderate phenotypic effect sizes (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Component trait QTL occur on 14 of the 21 linkage groups (LG) in the threespine stickleback genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>), suggesting that multiple genetic factors contribute to niche divergence between Paxton benthics and limnetics.</s><s>Both among LG and within certain LG, we find significant clusters of co-localized QTL (Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Supplementary Discussion 6), indicating close linkage of genes underlying different niche use traits or pleiotropic genetic effects.</s><s>Nearly all QTL for the component traits occur in known regions of repeated genomic differentiation between sympatric benthic and limnetic species in multiple lakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To determine how these QTL contribute to benthic-limnetic niche divergence, we fit multiple-QTL mapping (MQM) models of niche score to genotypes at QTL for component traits.</s><s>We selected only the single morphological QTL having the strongest estimated effect on niche score from each of the 14 LG containing QTL for component traits.</s><s>Although this method is conservative and likely underestimates the number of loci underlying niche score, it avoids overly complex models involving multiple, linked loci within LG.</s><s>We found additive allelic effects across multiple loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s><s>Seven of the 14 selected QTL significantly affected niche score (Extended Data Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</s><s>Two of these loci reside within clusters of co-localized QTL on LG 4 and 16 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Supplementary Discussion 6).</s><s>However, effect sizes are distributed approximately evenly among the seven significant loci (percentage variance explained [PVE] = 1.16-3.74%;</s><s>Extended Data Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</s><s>Next, we allowed all significant pairwise QTLxQTL interactions to enter the model and followed this by backward elimination of non-significant terms.</s><s>The resulting 'full' MQM model contained four pairwise interactions in addition to main effects representing eleven of the 14 morphological QTL (Extended Data Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To test the relative contributions of additive, dominance, and pairwise epistatic effects of these loci to niche score, we specified and compared three nested, general linear models at the markers nearest to the eleven significant QTL positions in the full MQM model.</s><s>The 'additive' model contained only the additive effects of the eleven loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>;
