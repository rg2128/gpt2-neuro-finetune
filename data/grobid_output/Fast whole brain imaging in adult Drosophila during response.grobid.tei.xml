<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Measuring activity simultaneously in the whole brain is critical to understanding how different brain regions interact to process and control sensory inputs, internal states, and behavior.</s><s>Whole-brain recordings not only reveal which regions are involved in which functions and with what network dynamics but also help to interpret the effects of a targeted intervention (e.g., a lesion or a local alteration with optogenetics) on the whole network and give context to local electrophysiology recordings.</s><s>Furthermore, they are necessary to characterize global changes affecting the brain on a large scale (such as different behavioral states) and detect patterns of activity involving distant regions.</s><s>This is already possible in humans, for which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has opened a new chapter in the study of brain activity underlying behavior, but this technique has low spatial and temporal resolution.</s><s>In animals, techniques for imaging a whole brain so far have allowed us to record activity at much higher resolutions but are still ordersof-magnitude slower than neuronal electrical activity.</s><s>For example, recent reports of scanning-based whole-brain imaging in zebrafish and Drosophila larvae had a frame rate of 12 Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and 5 Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, respectively.</s><s>By contrast, light field microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> makes it possible to image large volumes of scattering brain tissue at more than 100 Hz.</s><s>In this study, we leverage this technique to record large-scale activity in the brain of behaving adult fruit flies.</s><s>We present a method to optically access the fly's brain while enabling it to retain the ability to walk or groom.</s><s>We show that the near-whole brain can be imaged with a 20x objective at a frame rate up to 200 Hz and fluorescence recorded from pan-neuronally expressed calcium (GCaMP6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) or voltage (ArcLight <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) probes.</s><s>We present rich data sets of near-whole brain activity and behavior as well as two analysis methods.</s><s>First, we map activity for specific stimuli and behaviors with short time-scales; for example, we compared activity when the fly rested, walked, and groomed.</s><s>Second, we apply a computational method (principal component analysis [PCA], followed by independent component analysis <ref type="bibr">[ICA]</ref>) to extract components representing spatially distinct sources of activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>We show that these sources correspond to subneuropil areas or processes from small populations of neurons that are anatomically well characterized, and we compare their responses to flashes of light or odor puffs with those in literature reports of experiments done on restricted regions.</s><s>Additionally, by using this method, we discovered neuronal projections whose activity correlated with turning as well as previously unreported patterns of spontaneous voltage activity.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Imaging the near-whole brain of behaving adult Drosophila</head><p><s>We first fixed a fly's head by rotating it 45 degrees or more around the transversal axis to decrease the depth of the volume imaged and to improve access to the brain.</s><s>We then exposed the brain while keeping the eyes, antennae, and legs intact and clean (see Methods section and S1 Fig) .</s><s>A ball was placed under the fly's tarsi so that it could typically rest, walk, and groom.</s><s>We imaged the fly brain's fluorescence using light field microscopy.</s><s>As shown in Fig 1A , we modified an upright epifluorescence microscope (equipped with a 20x 1.0 numerical aperture [NA] or a 40x 0.8 NA objective) by adding a microlens array at the image plane of the objective and placing the camera sensor at the image plane of the microlens array through relay lenses.</s><s>We recorded light field images continuously with a high-speed scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) camera up to 100 Hz for GCaMP6 and 200 Hz for Arc-Light (using the middle of the camera sensor).</s></p><p><s>We then reconstructed the volumes-typically 600 x 300 x 200 μm 3 to encompass the whole brain (Fig 1B )-using the volumetric deconvolution method for light field microscopy described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Note that unlike other microscopy techniques that are based on scanning (e.g., two-photon, confocal, or light-sheet microscopy), excitation light illuminates the entire brain continuously, and all the photons emitted in the numerical aperture of the objective are used to reconstruct the image (minus an approximately 40% loss through the objective, tube lens, microlens array, and relay lenses).</s><s>This maximizes the number of photons collected (and thus information about brain activity) per units of volume and time.</s></p><p><s>We used 2-μm fluorescent beads embedded in a gel to measure the point spread function and found that it widens with distance from the focal plane, varying from 3.  We also examined near-whole brain activity in the absence of external stimuli (i.e., spontaneous behavior), which consisted of walking, grooming, and resting (see S3-S7 Movies).</s><s>Most strikingly, the brain was more active on a global scale when the fly walked than when it rested or groomed (see S3 Movie, Fig 2A, and S5A, S8, and S9 Figs), and global activity (average ΔF/ F) was correlated with walking (R 2 = 0.37 +/-0.19,</s><s>average +/-STD, N = 6).</s><s>To verify that this response was linked to walking rather than the optic flow from the ball, we repeated the experiment with a visually impaired norpA mutant fly and again found a global increase during walking in comparison with rest (see S4 Movie and S5A Fig) .</s><s>In contrast, we found only local activation in the region of the saddle, wedge, and antennal mechanosensory and motor center (in four out of five flies) during grooming.</s><s>To investigate whether the global increase during walking was coming exclusively from neurons expressing one type of neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, we performed the same experiments with more restricted lines.</s><s>We also found a global increase when GCaMP6f was expressed in cholinergic neurons, which form the majority of excitatory neurons in the fly brain (R 2   Near-whole brain activity maps for various conditions.</s><s>A) Comparison of fluorescence intensity when the fly rests and when it is active (either walking or grooming).</s><s>The pixel value is green if the fluorescence is higher during the behavior and magenta if the fluorescence is higher during rest.</s><s>Arrows point to regions (in the antennal mechanosensory and motor center) corresponding to the higher average change between groom and rest among flies (see also S9 Fig) .</s><s>The pan-neuronal driver was nsyb-Gal4 and the dopamine driver was TH-Gal4.</s><s>Both flies expressed GCaMP6f.</s><s>Note that there is an angle (39 degrees for the pan-neuronal experiment and 20 degrees for the dopamine experiment) between the z-axis and the anterior-posterior axis.</s><s>B) Comparison of fluorescence intensity when the fly turns left or right.</s><s>The arrows point to regions (in the posterior slope, gnathal ganglia, and superior lateral protocerebrum or anterior tubercule) symmetrical and reproducible from fly to fly.</s><s>The fly's genotype was nsyb-Gal4 and UAS-GCaMP6f.</s><s>Note that there is a 40 degree angle between the z-axis and the anterior-posterior axis.</s><s>The pixel value is green if the fluorescence is higher during turning left, magenta if the fluorescence is higher during turning right.</s><s>C) Comparison of fluorescence increase during the response to stimuli for odor (magenta) and light (green).</s><s>The arrows point to the posterior slope (bottom panel) and the optical glomeruli (middle panel).</s><s>The fly's genotype was Cha-Gal4, GMR57C10-Gal4, and UAS-GCaMP6f.</s><s>Note that the brain is tilted 19 degrees along the lateral axis.</s><s>See also S4-S9 Figs.</s><s>Data can be found on CNCRS.org</s><s>(http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/</s><s>K01J97ZN).</s><s>CNCRS, Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience; nsyb-Gal4, nSynaptobrevin-Gal4; TH-Gal4, tyrosine hydroxylase-Gal4; Cha-Gal4, choline acetyltransferase-Gal4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2006732.g002 of activity tightly locked with walking.</s><s>We also found surprisingly little activity during resting or grooming, apart from the mushroom body area.</s><s>This increase was observed in flies expressing GCaMP6f in both dopamine and serotonin neurons (TH-Gal4 and DDC-Gal4), but in that case, we also observed more background activity unrelated to behavior (S7 Movie and S5A Fig).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global activity during response to stimuli and behavior</head><p><s>We investigated the difference in activity when the fly turned left compared to right (Fig 2B and S5B Fig) .</s><s>Although there was a strong variability from fly to fly that will need to be characterized in future studies, we observed antisymmetric patterns in the ventral areas and in the lateral superior protocerebrum (as indicated by the arrows) in all flies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source-extraction algorithm reveals functional maps at the subneuropil level</head><p><s>We used a combination of statistical methods to extract maps and time series of spatially distinct sources of activity (see Methods section for details).</s><s>Briefly, we first applied PCA (using singular value decomposition) to find maps of correlated activity and to reduce dimensionality.</s><s>We then applied ICA to unmix the PCA maps and find sparse functional regions (see analysis pipeline in S4 Fig) .</s><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> shows z-stacks containing all components (z-score &gt; 3) from pan-neuronal GCaMP6 recordings (see also additional flies in S10 and S11 Figs).</s><s>We also performed the same analysis with flies that pan-neuronally expressed activity-independent green fluorescent protein (GFP) to help identify artifact-related components-movement, aliasing, or noise, as shown in S12 Fig.</s></p><p><s>Even though PCA and ICA are mathematical algorithms that make minimal assumptions about the brain, most functional maps matched well with anatomical structures.</s><s>We aligned the brain with an anatomical template <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> using landmarks registration and automatically sorted the components by brain region (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>).</s><s>In Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B</ref>, the left column presents the component's thresholded maps, whereas the right column presents central complex structures or neuronal processes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, assembled using Virtual Fly Brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Several subneuropil regions are recognizable from the shape of the maps (e.g., protocerebral bridge glomeruli, ellipsoid body rings, and fan-shaped body layers).</s></p><p><s>For some components, the combination of subneuropil regions present in the map allowed to assign it to a specific major neuron type (see Fig 4B, bottom part).</s><s>For example, z-scored maps with signals spanning both the alpha and the beta mushroom body lobes likely resulted from activity in alpha/beta Kenyon cell axons, maps with signals spanning both the alpha' and the beta' mushroom body lobes likely resulted from activity in alpha'/beta' Kenyon cell axons, whereas maps with signal in the gamma lobe likely resulted from activity in the gamma Kenyon cell axons.</s><s>Likewise, z-scored maps containing signals in one antennal lobe subneuropil region (with a glomerulus-like shape), in the calyx and in the lateral horn likely resulted from the activity of antennal lobe projection neurons.</s><s>Maps spanning a medulla column and a lobular layer were likely from transmedullar neurons.</s><s>Finally, the maps of the components matching the protocerebral bridge glomeruli also often contained radial parts of the ellipsoid body (e.g., Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B</ref>, left column, top panel), suggesting that these components might originate from tile or wedge neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extracted sources' time series retrieve known physiology in response to stimuli and reveal projections involved in turning left or right during walking</head><p><s>The component's time series (resulting from PCA/ICA or from region of interest [ROI] ΔF/F averages; S13 and S15-S17 Figs) were consistent with previous reports of activity from the  could be inaccurate in the case of maps containing small parts of large regions and noise in very small regions (i.e., the bulb or gall).</s><s>Data can be found on CNCRS.org</s><s>(http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K01J97ZN).</s><s>B) Comparison between functional and anatomical maps.</s><s>Left: functional maps from a pan-neuronal (GMR57C10-Gal4 and Cha-Gal4) GCaMP6f experiment.</s><s>Right: corresponding anatomical structures.</s><s>Maps were constructed using the Virtual Fly Brain database.</s><s>Three bottom images show neurons from major neuron types (three different Kenyon cell types, antennal lobe projection neuron, and transmedullar neurons) matching the functional maps.</s><s>The brain for the functional data is brain structures identified in the components' maps.</s><s>Most of the components responding to the onset and/or offset of light were in the optic lobe <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (S14 and S15 Figs).</s><s>In contrast, components responding to puffs of odors were mostly in the antennal lobe, the lateral horn, and the mushroom body <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> (S14 and S16 Figs).</s><s>Components likely representing the activity of antennal projection neurons were spontaneously active in the absence of odor, but some of them became more active when the odor was presented (S14C and S16A Figs), consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition, regions in the lateral protocerebrum, the posterior slope, the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC), the saddle, and the protocerebral bridge were strongly active when the fly walked (S17 Fig).</s><s>This is consistent with previous anatomical studies; the projection from the descending neurons are most dense in the posterior slope, ventrolateral protocerebrum, and the AMMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Some of these walking-related components were strongly correlated with turning left or right (see red components).</s><s>Their distribution in the brain as well as strong structural characteristics (e.g., tracks forming an inverted "V" shape, fine dorsal claw-like neurites) suggest that they were generated by the same neurons across flies.</s><s>Furthermore, the V-shaped components always preceded the other component correlated with turning toward the same direction-the peak of the cross-correlation function was at 68 ms for GCaMP6F (SEM = 11 ms, N = 6 pairs of components).</s><s>As shown in S18 Fig, we found similar components when using a Cha-Gal4 driver instead of a pan-neuronal driver (average cross-correlation peak time was 80 ms), which suggests that those neurons are cholinergic.</s><s>Note that these components are mostly present in the posterior slope, as are neurons involved in turning during flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Some maps had unequivocal anatomical counterparts.</s><s>For example, the first three maps matched well with the anatomy of processes from dopaminergic PPL1 neurons innervating mushroom body vertical lobe compartments, each component thus corresponding to only one or two cells per hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>number of components per brain region was typically smaller than it was for GCaMP6-we extracted an average 174 (STD = 68, N = 12) activity-related components (i.e., not noise or movement artifacts as detailed in the Methods section) from GCaMP6 recordings and 54 (STD = 14, N = 6) from ArcLight recordings, probably because of the probe's lower signal-to-noise ratio.</s><s>However, ArcLight components were similar to those found with GCaMP6: in the optic lobe, some components responded to the onset and/or offset of light, with various degrees of habituation.</s><s>In the posterior slope, we found peaks at the onsets of light.</s><s>We also recorded large peaks of activity in the ventrolateral protocerebrum.</s><s>Finally, we found components in the antennal lobe, lateral horn, and mushroom body responding to odor (S23 Fig).</s></p></div>

their maps contained shadows around areas with different background intensities as shown in S4 Fig.</s><s>For some flies, different conditions corresponded to different recordings, which we concatenated in time after preprocessing.</s><s>The reconstructed data as well as the data after preprocessing is available on the CRCNS website (https://crcns.org/NWB/Data_sets).</s></p><p><s>For early data sets (before direct synchronization of the cameras), the fluorescence and the behavior were aligned using the onset and offset of the excitation light.</s><s>The small discrepancy (approximately 30 ms per minute) between the total time given by the camera for the fluorescence and the camera for the behavior was corrected linearly.</s><s>The fluorescence data was then interpolated to match the behavior data using the MATLAB function Interpolate2vid.</s></p><p><s>We manually analyzed the behavior (noting the times of the behaviors or pressing different keyboard keys when we recognized different behavior using the MATLAB GUI Video_Annotate in https://github.com/sophie63/FlyLFM).</s><s>We also characterized the fly's walk by tracking the movements of the ball using FIJI's optic flow plugin (Gaussian Window MSE).</s></p><p><s>Maps comparing the activity during rest and walking, resting and grooming, turning left and turning right, and 1 second after stimulus presentation compared to 1 second before were obtained by simply averaging the time series in each voxel for the different conditions and subtracting these maps from one another.</s><s>The positive value was colored in magenta and the negative in green, thus showing which condition dominated in which voxel.</s></p><p><s>The average of the volume time series was aligned to an anatomical template (available from https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/DrosAdultBRAINdomains) in which the brain is segmented into regions according to the nomenclature described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The registration was performed using landmarks with ImageJ (as described in http://imagej.net/Name_</s><s>Landmarks_and_Register).</s><s>We marked several points in the protocerebral bridge, the tips of the mushroom body (between the alpha and alpha' lobes), the middle of the noduli, the lateral tip of the lateral triangles, the lateral tip of the lateral horns, the center of the ellipsoid boy, the center of the antennal lobes, and the bottom part of the trachea at the level of the noduli.</s><s>Although the landmarks were readily observable with the background fluorescence (see S3 Fig, for example), making a template superposing the components to the volume average helped to visually find the landmarks.</s></p><p><s>Dimensionality was then reduced by separating the volumes into slices of thickness corresponding to the point spread function height and averaging in z for each slice.</s><s>The 4D data sets were typically (x, y, z, t) = 200 x 100 x 10 x 10,000 at this stage.</s></p><p><s>For source extraction, we found that using melodic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> from the FSL package readily produced meaningful components.</s><s>However, as the code was running slowly on our large data sets, we adapted it in MATLAB to parallelize some steps.</s><s>A first step of SVD was used to remove the largest part of the components before calculating the pixel-wise temporal variance (without spatial filtering) that was used to normalize the data.</s><s>We then reapplied SVD and plotted the log of the singular value spectrum to automatically detect the shoulder at the point with a 45˚tangent.</s><s>We found that although the components with the smallest variance were noise, some activity-related components were still present after the shoulder point.</s><s>As such, choosing twice the number of components at the shoulder gave a good compromise between keeping activity and removing noise components.</s><s>ICA was then applied to the SVD spatial components with FastICA <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> (see ICAalamelodic.m file from https://github.com/sophie63/</s><s>FlyLFM).</s><s>The sign was chosen so that the average of the positive side of the map was larger than the negative side.</s><s>The components were then automatically sorted by brain region; after registering the standard brain to the data, we averaged the components maps in anatomically defined regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> using regions masks and chose the main region as the one with the highest average.</s><s>We removed components corresponding to movement or noise partly automatically (removing components present in more than five regions and containing more than 200 separate objects) and partly by hand (see example of typical artifactual components in S11 Fig) using a Jupyter notebook (the notebooks corresponding to the choices made for the figures in this paper can be found at https://github.com/sophie63/FlyLFM).</s></p><p><s>To obtain the time series from regions of interest, we first made masks using the PCA/ICA maps.</s><s>We calculated the standard deviation from the value in the map and set all voxels with values inferior to three times that standard deviation to zero.</s><s>We then used those masks to do a weighted average of the ΔF/F time series.</s></p><p><s>The time series for turning left or right were obtained by convolving the optic flow for the ball going left or right, with a kernel corresponding to the GCaMP6 impulse response.</s><s>These time series were then regressed with the components' time series, and we inspected the maps with the strongest regression coefficients.</s></p></div>
