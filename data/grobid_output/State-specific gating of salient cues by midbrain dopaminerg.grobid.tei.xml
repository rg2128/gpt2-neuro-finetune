<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cues predicting unavoidable aversive outcomes also activate VTA DAâžœBA axons</head><p><s>If VTA DAâžœBA axons carry information about motivational salience rather than strictly about rewards, they should also acquire responses to cues predicting highly salient aversive outcomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>To test this, mice previously trained on the task involving an aversive cue predicting avoidable quinine were subsequently trained on a modified task in which the aversive cue now predicted an unavoidable aversive outcome (air puff delivered to the face; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>; task performance remained high with few false alarms, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Strikingly, we observed a large increase in VTA DAâžœBA axon activity in response to air puffs, and emergence of significant responses to the aversive cue predicting this unavoidable outcome (AC-Un) within the first session (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c-e</ref>).</s><s>Air puff responses decreased across sessions, accompanied by a concomitant increase in AC-Un responses (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d-f</ref>).</s><s>These effects were not due to overall changes in network excitability, as RC response magnitudes remained stable throughout these sessions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6g</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to the lack of any obvious behavioral responses to the avoidable quinine-predicting cue following training, mice developed an active avoidance behavior -blinking -to the AC-Un (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a-b</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these findings suggest that cue-evoked increases in activity of VTA DAâžœBA axons reflect an unsigned (i.e.</s><s>valence-independent) signal of the motivational salience of appetitive and aversive predicted outcomes.</s></p><p><s>The relative magnitude of VTA DAâžœBA axon responses to appetitive vs. aversive cues changed depending on motivational state.</s><s>Satiation led to a decrease in RC responses in VTA DAâžœBA axons and an increase in AC-Un responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d-e</ref>), resulting in a shift in cue response preference from reward cues to aversive cues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>).</s><s>These findings suggest a shift from a reward-seeking state to a defensive state that results in a decrease in the relative motivational salience of food-predicting vs. punishment-predicting cues.</s><s>Accordingly, sated mice exhibited a persistent defensive behavior not observed in hungry mice -sustained, partial closure of the eye ipsilateral to the air puff (contralateral to the visual stimulus; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c-d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next addressed whether these VTA DAâžœBA axon responses were specific to air puffpredicting cues or whether they generalized to a different aversive outcome eliciting a distinct avoidance behavior.</s><s>We replaced air puff delivery (which elicited eye closure) with a mild unavoidable tail shock that elicited increased locomotion, possibly as part of an escape response (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7e</ref>,f; n = 6 mice previously trained on the quinine/air puff tasks and 2 newly trained mice; task performance remained high with few false alarms, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref>).</s><s>As with air puff delivery, tail shocks increased activity of VTA DAâžœBA axons early in training (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7g</ref>), as did tail shock-predicting cues (AC-Un) after one day of training (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6e</ref>).</s><s>As with cues predicting air puff, satiation resulted in significantly elevated responses to tail shock-predicting cues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3h</ref>) and a shift in response preference towards these cues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3i</ref>).</s><s>Control recordings from VTA DAâžœBA axons expressing GFP confirmed that cue-evoked responses were not generated or influenced by motion artifacts (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7h</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, despite differences in behavioral responses to aversive cues that predict air puff or tail shock, both these cues evoked similar hunger-dependent responses in VTA DAâžœBA axons.</s></p><p><s>Additional evidence supported the notion that VTA DAâžœBA axons may signal the motivational salience of cues predicting salient outcomes associated with active motor strategies.</s><s>Specifically, while visual cues predicting unavoidable tail shock drove strong VTA DAâžœBA axon responses following training (as well as delayed, cue-induced locomotor behavior), similar responses were not observed following training in experiments where the same visual stimuli predicted passively avoidable tail shocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3j-l</ref>;
