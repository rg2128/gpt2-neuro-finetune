<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>O lfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) initiate the sense of smell by detecting a vast number of odorous chemicals through odorant receptors (ORs).</s><s>ORs are G protein-coupled receptors with a putative seven-transmembrane domain structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>OR genes form the largest gene family present in any genome analyzed to date.</s><s>Phylogenetic analyses separate mammalian OR sequences into two distinct groups, which are referred to as class I and class II ORs 2 .</s><s>Class I OR genes, which were first identified in fish and then in frog <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , were initially considered to be evolutionary relics in mammals.</s><s>However, genomic analyses have revealed that mammals possess a substantial number of functional class I OR genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , suggesting that class I ORs have physiologically important functions.</s><s>On the other hand, class II OR genes are specific to terrestrial animals and account for ~90% of the mammalian OR repertoire.</s></p><p><s>Individual OSNs are believed to express a single functional allele of a single OR gene from the repertoire of either class I or class II ORs.</s><s>The process of the singular OR gene expression occurs through two sequential steps, a single OR gene choice that initiates the process and subsequent maintenance of transcription of the chosen single OR allele.</s><s>Regarding the initial choice of a single OR gene, Magklara et al. reported that all OR genes are epigenetically silenced prior to OR choice and that a singular OR allele is chosen by stochastic escape from heterochromatic silencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>The latter step, referred to as the "one neuron-one receptor" rule, is maintained by an OR-elicited negative-feedback signal that prevents the activation of additional OR genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>It has recently been demonstrated that this signal is triggered by components of the unfolded protein response, which detect the newly synthesized OR within the endoplasmic reticulum and thereby activate downstream signaling cascades to stabilize OR transcription and to prevent secondary OR gene choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Although these studies describe a molecular mechanism for ensuring singular OR gene transcription, the cis-regulatory elements/enhancers, which may open up the local chromatin architecture to orchestrate the first step OR choice are poorly understood.</s></p><p><s>The function of cis-regulatory elements for the transcriptional activation of a single gene within a multigene cluster has been well-documented for the β-globin cluster, in which the locus control region (LCR) located 6-22 kilobases (kb) upstream of the proximal globin gene enhances the transcription of one of five linked β-globin genes depending on the developmental stage of the organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>A few cis-regulatory elements have been reported in mouse class II OR genes.</s><s>The 2.1-kb H element resides 75 kb upstream of the nearest OR gene, Olfr1507, and functions as the LCR of a cluster of seven class II OR genes spread over 141 kb on chromosome 14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>A targeted deletion of the H element abolished the expression of three proximal OR genes and decreased the expression of four distal OR genes in the cluster but did not affect the expression of ORs outside the cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>The P element regulates the expression of 10 OR genes within the P-centromeric cluster, which consists of 24 OR genes spread over 471 kb on chromosome 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Because ~1100 mouse OR genes are scattered over 69 loci (including singletons) within the genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , additional regulatory elements are expected.</s><s>Recently, a genome-wide search for intergenic OR enhancers by DNase I hypersensitivity-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments uncovered 35 candidate elements linked to OR clusters, including H and P in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>The targeted deletion of one of these, Lipsi, led to reduced expression of the eight class II genes within the linked cluster on chromosome 2, whereas OR genes from a distal cluster on the same or different chromosomes were unaffected <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Thus, all three regulatory elements for class II genes operate locally and in cis, controlling 7-10 genes within the adjacent clusters.</s><s>The distances over which these elements exert effects are ~200 kb.</s><s>To date, no cis-regulatory elements for class I genes have been identified.</s></p><p><s>During evolution, class I OR genes were maintained in a single cluster and have come to form one of the largest gene clusters in the mouse genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>By sharp contrast, class II OR genes were spread over most chromosomes by duplication and intra-and inter-chromosomal translocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>The differential genomic organization of class I and class II OR genes is enigmatic, and the reason why class I genes did not migrate outside the cluster or to other chromosomes is unknown.</s><s>In the mouse, 158 class I genes reside in a single huge cluster spread over a ~3 megabase (Mb) genomic region on chromosome 7, and this cluster is interrupted by the β-globin cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>By focusing on one of the mouse class I genes, Olfr544, we previously provided experimental evidence for a cis-regulatory element using Bacillus subtilis genome (BGM) transgenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In this study, we analyzed a cis-regulatory element of the mouse class I OR cluster and identified the J element, which exhibits unique features with respect to its long-range regulation and is conserved in all mammalian species examined.</s><s>The J element regulates class I genes expression of a larger number of genes and over a greater genomic distance than known class II enhancers.</s><s>Genome analysis uncovers evolutionarily conserved sequence motifs in the J element from the platypus to humans.</s><s>In addition, we provide genetic evidence that the allelic exclusion of class I genes depends on the activity of the J element.</s><s>Thus, our data reveal a long-range cis-regulatory element that governs the singular expression of class I gene and has been phylogenetically preserved to retain a single cluster organization of class I genes in mammals.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The class I OR cluster.</s><s>One of the characteristic features of the class I OR family in mammals is that all class I OR genes reside on a single chromosome, comprising a single huge gene cluster that does not contain any class II genes.</s><s>In mice, 158 class I genes, including 29 pseudogenes, reside at positions 102,476,773-105,369,317 on chromosome 7 (mm10), forming a ~3 Mb cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The genomic size of the class I OR cluster is ~70 times larger than that of the β-globin cluster embedded in this region.</s><s>There are two phylogenetic groups of class I ORs, the αand β-groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>The α-group is specific to tetrapods, whereas the β-group is conserved across vertebrate species <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>In mice, the β-class I OR family consists of three genes, Olfr543, Olfr544, and Olfr545, which are located near the centromeric end of the class I cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>These OR genes have intact open reading frames and belong to the MOR42 family.</s></p><p><s>A cis-regulatory element for the class I OR gene Olfr544.</s><s>Because β-class I ORs are phylogenetically most well-conserved among vertebrates, we focused on this group to examine whether a cis-regulatory element is located in proximity to the β-class I genes.</s><s>Using BGM transgenesis, we recently reported the presence of a cis-regulatory element for the Olfr544 β-class I gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Conservation analysis of the genomic region of the transgene using VISTA revealed conserved synteny of the coding regions of class I OR genes and neighboring genes (Stim1, Rrm1, and Trim21) among placental mammals including human, macaque, horse, dog, and cow (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we found a strikingly homologous intergenic region between αand β-class I genes in all analyzed mammalian genomes but not in zebrafish or Xenopus tropicalis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To more precisely identify the region responsible for Olfr544 transgene expression, we generated a 5′ deletion series based on a Tg-220 transgene in which Olfr544 was tagged with an IRES-tauEGFP reporter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Referring to the VISTA plots, we truncated the 5′ end to yield shorter transgenes with 79 kb (Tg-U79), 29 kb (Tg-U29), and 16 kb (Tg-U16) of genomic DNA upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of Olfr544.</s><s>All four lines carrying Tg-220 showed a punctate pattern of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression within the dorsal zone of the MOE and axonal projections into the dorsal glomeruli of each olfactory bulb (OB) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>In a deletion series, Tg-U79 and Tg-U29 also showed robust transgene expression with consistent glomerular convergence, whereas none of the Tg-U16 lines or founders showed EGFP expression.</s><s>These results indicate that a 13-kb intergenic region located 16 kb to 29 kb upstream of the TSS of Olfr544 contains a cis-regulatory element for Olfr544 expression.</s></p><p><s>Identification of a potential enhancer element.</s><s>Because critical intergenic regions such as transcriptional enhancers are frequently conserved during evolution, we first searched for homologous sequences between mouse and human genomes to identify a potential enhancer element in the 13-kb region.</s><s>A VISTA plot of the mouse 13-kb enhancer region to the human genome delineated several homology peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Next, to examine the conservation of these homology peaks in other mammalian species, we selected one species as a representative of each placental mammalian order: human (Primates), guinea pig (Rodentia), rabbit (Lagomorpha), horse (Perissodactyla), dog (Carnivora), cow (Cetartiodactyla), and African elephant (Proboscidea).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> shows the genomic maps of the junctional regions between αand β-class I ORs in mouse as well as seven placental mammalian genomes deduced from the whole-genome alignments in the UCSC database.</s><s>This locus comprised a syntenic region among those placental mammals.</s><s>Genome sequence analysis revealed that a 1.9-kb region that included a cluster of high homology peaks in the middle of the 13-kb region was well conserved among all tested placental mammals (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Although a β-class I OR gene is pseudogenized in humans, the 1.9-kb region was also conserved in humans, suggesting that it may function as an enhancer not only for β-class I ORs but also for α-class I ORs.</s><s>Because this conserved 1.9-kb sequence is located in the junctional region of two phylogenetic groups, the αand β-class I OR genes, we named it the "J element".</s></p><p><s>To evaluate the importance of the J element, we compared the evolutionary conservation of the J element with that of 35 other mouse OR enhancers, including putative ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> (see Methods section).</s><s>Among the 36 elements examined, 15 elements, including the J element, are conserved in all tested placental mammalian genomes and linked to OR gene (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, each OR gene linked to the conserved enhancer element belongs to the same orthologous gene group (OGG) among mammalian species (Supplementary Data 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , suggesting that the evolutionarily conserved OR enhancer elements regulate the expression of an OR subfamily whose physiological functions are generally important for mammalian species.</s><s>Our conservation analysis indicated that the J element was one of the most highly conserved of the 15 conserved OR enhancer elements (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>).</s><s>These results strongly suggest that the J element is evolutionarily conserved as an enhancer for class I OR genes in placental mammals.</s></p><p><s>Functional analysis of the J element.</s><s>To examine the function of the J element, we constructed two transgenes, J13k-gVenus Tg and J-gVenus Tg, in which the 13-kb fragment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) and the 3.8-kb NcoI fragment including the J element were placed upstream of the 0.9-kb Olfr544 promoter region and the gapVenus reporter gene, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>Note that the Olfr544 promoter region itself could not activate reporter gene expression (see Tg-U16, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Both transgenic (Tg) lines/founders of J13k-gVenus Tg and J-gVenus Tg exhibited reproducible and robust expression of gapVenus in OSNs located in the dorsal MOE, where class I OSNs reside (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the majority of gapVenus-positive axons in both Tg mice projected diffusely to multiple glomeruli in the dorsal OB, corresponding to the class I OSN projection domain.</s><s>These results suggest that the J element possesses class I OSN-specific enhancer activity.</s></p><p><s>To confirm the class I OSN-specific enhancer activity, we analyzed the co-expression of gapVenus with class I or class II OR genes in J-gVenus Tg mice by two-color in situ hybridization (ISH) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s><s>GapVenus signals are co-localized with both αand β-class I genes, suggesting that the J element functions as an enhancer not only for β-class I but also for α-class I genes.</s><s>In addition, quantification analysis of a total of 6364 neurons from three independent mice demonstrates that gapVenus-expressing OSNs predominantly labeled with class I genes but not with class II genes (class I, 258/3112 (coexpression rate = 8.3%); class II, 4/3252 (0.12%); Fisher's exact test, p &lt; 2 × 10 -16 ; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>), indicating that the J element has class I OSN-specific enhancer activity.</s><s>We also examined the enhancer activity of the J element in zebrafish because some class II enhancers support reporter expression in zebrafish OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>However, unlike the H and Lipsi elements, the J element did not activate reporter expression in the OE of any of the tested zebrafish (Supplementary Fig. <ref

of ten class I genes tended to decrease (fold change &lt; -1.3, p &gt; 0.05), and those of 43 genes including two atypical class I OR genes, Olfr556 and Olfr686 16 , which are exceptionally expressed in the ventral MOE were unaltered.</s><s>Although ΔJ had a slightly graded effect on the expression of class I OR genes that was commensurate with genomic distance, i.e., it decreased the expression of more genes located in proximal positions to the J element (log2-fold change vs. genomic distance from the J element; Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.42, p = 9.7 × 10 -7 ), ΔJ also affected the expression of Olfr692, which is located at the opposite end of the cluster (2.9 Mb from the J element), indicating that the J element exerts an effect over a ~3-Mb genomic region that includes the whole cluster.</s><s>Because there was no significant effect on class II gene expression or on the expression of any of the tested genes other than ORs, the effect of ΔJ was specific to the class I cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The J element regulates the probability of OR gene

4.31, n = 3 for wild-type; 19.2 ± 3.97, n = 3 for ΔJ; mean ± s.e.m.; unpaired t-test, p = 0.91), suggesting that the deletion of the J element does not result in cell death.</s><s>Because there was no significant effect of ΔJ on class II genes expression, it is conceivable that OSNs that fail to express class I genes by ΔJ arrest neuronal differentiation rather express class II genes as secondary choice.</s><s>Although the decreased number of class I OSNs might result in a thinner dorsal MOE, there was no morphological difference in the dorsal MOE between ΔJ and wild-type mice.</s><s>Because OSNs expressing class I and class II genes are intermingled within the dorsal MOE, the reduction in the number of class I OSNs could not be detected morphologically.</s></p><p><s>The J element

co-expression rate of GFP with Olfr545 was 54.3% (n = 3), supporting monoallelic and mutually exclusive expression of the tagged and untagged alleles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>).</s><s>In ΔJ heterozygous mice (J/ΔJ), all the Olfr545-positive cells were GFP-positive (co-expression rate of 100%, n = 3), indicating that deletion of the J element abolished expression of Olfr545 in cis.</s><s>The intact J allele could not rescue the expression of Olfr545 of the mutant ΔJ allele in trans; thus, the J element operates in cis.</s></p><p><s>Allelic exclusion depends on the activity of the J element.</s><s>Each OSN expresses only one OR gene in a monoallelic and mutually exclusive manner.</s><s>If allelic exclusion of the OR gene occurs in a

GFP-positive OSNs in Olfr545-IRES-tauGFP heterozygous mice with either an intact J (J/J) or a heterozygous ΔJ mutation (J/ΔJ) background in whole-mount specimens (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a-c</ref>).</s><s>Unexpectedly, the number of GFP-positive cells in J/ΔJ was nearly double that in J/J (148 ± 13.8, n = 6 for J/J; 306 ± 43.5, n = 5 for J/ΔJ; mean ± s.e.m.), indicating that expression of the GFP-tagged Olfr545 allele with the intact J increased two-fold in J/ΔJ.</s><s>To further confirm this observation, we quantified the number of OSNs expressing other class I OR genes by ISH.</s><s>If the expression frequency from the intact J allele did not increase in J/ΔJ, the number of OSNs expressing class I OR genes would be reduced to ~50% of the sum of the

increases to complement the loss or reduction of class I gene expression from the ΔJ allele.</s><s>In other words, the allelic exclusion of class I genes is not solely established by a stochastic choice of a single class I allele but depends on the activity of the J element.</s></p><p><s>Conserved sequence motifs in the J element.</s><s>Finally, we analyzed the conserved sequence motifs in the J element.</s><s>In the class II enhancers, the H and P elements contain conserved sequence motifs of multiple homeodomain sites and neighboring O/E-like sites that are essential for their enhancer

scanned the mouse J sequence and found several homeodomain sites and O/E-like sites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6a</ref>).</s><s>Intriguingly, the homeodomain and O/E-like sites were clustered within the 430-bp region that corresponded to the highest homology region between the mouse and human J elements (hereinafter referred to as the core J element).</s><s>This motif organization of multiple homeodomain sites and a neighboring O/E-like site is similar to that found in the H and P elements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6a</ref>), suggesting that the sequence motifs in the J element also have a critical role in class I OR gene expression.</s></p><p><s>Because class I ORs exist not only in placental mammals but also in marsupials and monotremes, it is possible that functional motifs in the core J element are conserved in all mammals from humans to the platypus.</s><s>By focusing on the 430-bp core J element, we further analyzed conserved sequence motifs among mammals by constructing hidden Markov models (HMM).</s><s>Using HMM, the top hit sequence was obtained from four aplacental mammalian genomes, including three marsupials (opossum, wallaby, and Tasmanian devil) and a monotreme (platypus).</s><s>The obtained genomic sequences were orthologous to the core J element as shown by the fact that they resided near the β-class

target="#fig_8">6b</ref>), four homeodomain sites, a neighboring O/E-like site, and a conserved sequence motif (5′-AAACTTTTC-3′).</s><s>The 5′-AAACTTTTC-3′ motif that was perfectly conserved among the analyzed mammalian genomes was not present in the H and P elements but was specific to the J element, suggesting that this motif may be responsible for the characteristic features of class I gene expression.</s><s>Identification of factors that bind to the class I-specific conserved sequence motifs will further unveil molecular mechanisms underlying J-element dependent class I OR gene expression.</s><s>II genes within a ~200 kb genomic range <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , the impact of ΔJ is much larger both in terms of number of genes (75 genes) and genomic reach (~3 Mb). Mo</s><s>eover, the J element regulates the class I gene expression of much larger number of genes and over a much greater genomic distance than any other known enhancer elements, e.g., the largest number was ~30 genes of the cluster control region for the protocadherin-β cluster and some protocadherin-γ genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , and the longest genomic distance was ~1.3 Mb of 3′ enhancer element for the protooncogene Myc 26 .</s><s>Thus, our experiments demonstrate the existence of a long-range enhancer element for the class I cluster.</s><s>The mechanisms underlying the differential impact of the enhancer activity of the J element and the class II enhancers are unknown.</s><s>One possible explanation for a long-range regulation of the J element is that class I genes throughout the cluster can be accessible by the J element, which is established by the organization of 3D chromatin structure of this locus.</s><s>The probability of class I OR gene choice depends on 3D chromatin structure rather than linear genomic distance.</s></p></div>
