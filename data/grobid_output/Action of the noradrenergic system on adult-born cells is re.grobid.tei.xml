<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p><s>For all experiments, before any drug treatment and/or environmental manipulations (enrichment with ϩ/Ϫlimonene), all groups of animals were tested for their ability to spontaneously discriminate between three pairs of similar odorants: ϩ and Ϫlimonene, pentanol/butanol, and decanal/dodecanone using an olfactory cross habituation test (see below).</s><s>To assess the efficacy of our manipulations to modulate olfactory discrimination abilities, mice were then subjected to an identical post-test, beginning the day after the end of treatment, again using all of the three odorant pairs to assess changes in their discrimination ability.</s></p></div>

perceptual olfactory learning is reinforced by the fact that NA is important for the occurrence of long-term potentiation in the OB; indeed, NA antagonists disrupt induction of long-term potentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wilson and Sullivan, 1994)</ref> and longterm potentiation in the OB seems to depend principally upon adult-born cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nissant et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Here we found that, despite their immature electrical property, newborn cell are already sensitive to noradrenergic stimulation.</s><s>NA is capable of triggering molecular mechanisms leading to long-term potentiation which could promote survival of newborn cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kermen et al., 2010)</ref> and increased excitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mouly et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>As a result, the neuromodulatory action of NA could alter receptive fields of the mitral cells to sharpen the contrast between odor neural representations and improve discrimination.</s></p><p><s>The present study examines the mechanisms underlying the survival of adult-born cells during perceptual learning.</s><s>We found that the improvement of discrimination relied on the action of the noradrenergic system on the adult-born cells.</s><s>Thus, our findings support a major role of the noradrenergic top-down control in perceptual learning, acting on inhibitory adult-born cells and refinement in odorant feature encoding, contributing to experiencedependent changes in odorant discrimination.</s></p></div><figure
