Everitt, 1983)</ref>.</s><s>Using this paradigm, direct administration of the 5-HT 1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT into the prefrontal cortex was found to improve attentional performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Winstanley et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>However, both indirect administration of the same compound <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carli &amp; Samanin, 2000)</ref> and global 5-HT depletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Harrison, Everitt, &amp; Robbins, 1997)</ref> resulted in impaired performance on the same task.</s><s>This suggests that if activation of the 5-HT 1A receptors is not limited to the prefrontal cortex, the overall reduction in the release of 5-HT from the raphe that results from activation of the presynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors in this region will lead to an impairment of attention.</s></p><p><s>There is considerable anecdotal evidence that attentional processes are affected by psilocybin (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Shulgin &amp; Shulgin, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McKenna, 1992)</ref> and formal self-rating scales indicate that psilocybin can cause a subjective reduction in vigilance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hasler et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>However, only one study has attempted to assess the effect of psilocybin on attention objectively.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al.
