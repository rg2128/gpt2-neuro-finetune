<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>cells with a means to be seen deep inside mammalian hosts, facilitating the study of the mammalian microbiome and the development of diagnostic and therapeutic cellular agents.</s></p><p><s>Gas vesicles comprise all-protein shells with sizes on the order of 200 nm that enclose hollow interiors, allowing dissolved gases to freely permeate in and out while excluding water <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>We recently discovered the ability of these proteins to scatter sound waves and thereby produce ultrasound contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>However, the ability of the multi-gene clusters encoding gas vesicles to serve as reporter genes in heterologous species has not been demonstrated.</s><s>Gas vesicles are encoded in their native bacterial or archaeal hosts by operons of 8-14 genes, which include the primary structural protein GvpA, the optional external scaffolding protein GvpC, and several secondary proteins that function as essential minor constituents or chaperones <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>As a starting point for developing ARGs, we chose a compact E. coli-compatible gas vesicle gene cluster from Bacillus megaterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>, top, left).</s></p><p><s>While cells containing this construct were able to produce small, bicone-shaped gas vesicles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1, b-c</ref>, left), its expression did not result in bacteria detectable by ultrasound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>, left), most likely because the small gas vesicles produced from this construct have weak acoustic scattering.</s><s>At the same time, transforming E. coli with a gas vesicle gene cluster derived from the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae, whose gas vesicles are highly echogenic <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , did not result in gas vesicle expression.</s><s>Given the high sequence homology of GvpA between organisms (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>), we hypothesized that a combination of the structural GvpA genes from A. flos-aquae with the accessory genes GvpR-U from B. megaterium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>, middle) would result in the formation of gas vesicles with characteristics favorable for ultrasound imaging.</s><s>Indeed, expression of this engineered gene cluster resulted in E. coli containing gas vesicles with significantly larger dimensions compared to the B. megaterium operon, and these nanostructures appeared to occupy a greater fraction of intracellular volume (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1, b-c</ref>, middle).</s><s>Strikingly, these cells produced robust ultrasound contrast compared to green fluorescent protein (GFP) controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>, middle).</s><s>Further engineering comprising the addition of a gene encoding the A. flos-aquae scaffolding protein GvpC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>, right) resulted in wider and more elongated gas vesicles more closely resembling those native to A. flos-aquae <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1, b-c</ref>, right), and generated stronger ultrasound contrast (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>, right).</s><s>We refer to this optimized genetically engineered construct as acoustic reporter gene 1 or ARG1.</s></p><p><s>To confirm that the ultrasound signal from ARG1-expressing cells is due to the presence of gas vesicles, we applied acoustic pulses with amplitudes above the gas vesicles' critical collapse pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>In purified form, this results in the immediate collapse of these protein nanostructures and dissolution of their gas contents, eliminating ultrasound contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>As expected, the application of high-pressure pulses made cells expressing ARG1 invisible to ultrasound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>).</s><s>The ability of ARG-based contrast to be erased in situ is used throughout this study to confirm the source of acoustic signals and subtract background.</s><s>ARG1 expression resulted in average gas vesicle contents of 9.4 ± 0.4 mg/g E. coli (N=3, ±SEM), corresponding to approximately 100 gas vesicles per cell.</s><s>These nanostructures occupy roughly 10 percent of the intracellular space.</s><s>Acoustically silent cells expressing the B. megaterium gene cluster produced a similar quantity of gas vesicle proteins (9.7 ± 1.5 mg/g, N=3, ±SEM), underscoring the importance of genetic engineering in producing intracellular nanostructures with the appropriate size and shape to be detected with ultrasound.</s><s>A fraction of ARG1-expressing cells was buoyant in aqueous media (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, a-b), suggesting that gas vesicles occupy more than 10% of their volume.</s><s>However, the expected buoyant force on these cells, even at much higher expression levels, is weak compared to other forces such as flagellar thrust (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine the detection limit of ARG-expressing cells, we imaged a concentration series of E. coli transformed with ARG1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>).</s><s>Cells at concentrations as low as 5 × 10 7 cells/ml produced detectable signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2, a-b</ref>).</s><s>This equates to a roughly 0.005% volume fraction, or approximately 100 cells per voxel based on cubic voxel dimensions of 100 µm.</s><s>This sensitivity should be sufficient for many in vivo scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, bacteria enriched for buoyancy prior to imaging provide 2.4-fold higher signal (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2, c-d</ref>), suggesting that sensitivity could be improved further by optimizing ARG expression.</s></p><p><s>To test whether ARGs could provide a readout of state-dependent genetic pathways, we placed ARGs under the control of a promoter regulated by the chemical inducer isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).</s><s>Ultrasound signals from E. coli expressing ARG1 in this configuration followed the expected dose-response curve of IPTG-controlled expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2, c-d</ref>), confirming their ability to serve as the output signal for engineered genetic circuits.</s><s>Significant ultrasound contrast could be observed 4 hours after IPTG induction (pvalue = 0.01, N=4), and continued to increase during the 22-hour culturing period (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine whether the expression of ARGs has any deleterious effect on host cells, we measured the growth curves of E. coli expressing ARG1 or GFP.</s><s>After induction, cells expressing both constructs continued to divide and reached similar saturation densities (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>).</s><s>For both ARG1 and GFP the final density was somewhat lower than in uninduced controls, as expected from the metabolic demand of protein expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>We also assessed the viability of ARG-expressing cells after ultrasound imaging and acoustic collapse.</s><s>TEM images of cells acquired before and after exposure to collapsing acoustic pulses show that gas vesicles can be eliminated without obvious cellular damage (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>).</s><s>To examine the impact of ultrasound exposure on cell growth, we cultured E. coli expressing ARG1 as colonies on solid media and applied acoustic collapse pulses to half the plate.</s><s>Gas vesicle collapse in insonated cells was confirmed by a decrease in optical scattering (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4, c-d</ref>).</s><s>After incubation for an additional 20 hours, no significant difference was observed in the diameter of the insonated colonies compared to un-insonated controls, indicating that ultrasound exposure does not affect cell viability (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4e</ref>).</s><s>Strikingly, insonated colonies re-expressed gas vesicles during this period, as indicated by the restoration of pressure-sensitive light scattering (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>, e-f).</s></p><p><s>It is often informative to simultaneously image more than one population of cells, as done optically using spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins.</s><s>Analogous acoustic multiplexing can be performed using genetic variants of gas vesicles that collapse at different pressures using multiple images acquired during sequential application of increasing pressure pulses (Supplementary Note 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>To explore whether this could be done with ARGs, we constructed a new version of the ARG gene cluster containing a modified version of A. flosaquae GvpC.</s><s>Deletion or truncation of this outer scaffolding protein results in gas vesicles with lower collapse pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , allowing the production of nanostructures distinguishable from each other under ultrasound <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Following this approach, we modified our gene cluster by truncating GvpC to retain only one of its five repeating alpha-helical domains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>).</s><s>E. coli expressing the resulting gene cluster, which we refer to as ARG2, showed robust gas vesicle production and ultrasound contrast, similar to ARG1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3, b-c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5, a-c</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with our design, gas vesicles purified from ARG2-expressing E. coli had a lower critical hydrostatic collapse pressure than nanostructures formed by cells expressing ARG1 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5d</ref>), and cellular ARG2 contrast was erasable at lower acoustic pressures (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e</ref>).</s><s>The two variants' distinct collapse spectra (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5f</ref>) allowed E. coli expressing ARG1 and ARG2 to be imaged in multiplex using pressure spectrum unmixing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3, d-e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>After establishing the core capabilities of ARGs in vitro, we set out to demonstrate their detectability in vivo by imaging ARG-expressing cells in biologically relevant anatomical contexts.</s><s>One particularly important target for in vivo microbial imaging is the mammalian GI tract, given the impact of the gut microbiome on the host's health <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and the development of GI-targeted microbial therapeutics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Due to its location deep inside the body, the GI tract is difficult to image using optical techniques.</s><s>To establish a proof of concept for ultrasonic imaging of microbes in this context, we expressed ARGs in a probiotic bacterial strain and assessed the ability of ultrasound to localize this bacterium inside the colon (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>) in comparison with bioluminescent imaging.</s><s>The E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a probiotic microbe capable of colonizing the mammalian GI tract <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>EcN has been used clinically in humans for 100 years to treat enteric infection and inflammatory bowel conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , and is a common chassis for therapeutic synthetic biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>EcN cells transformed with a plasmid expressing ARG1 produced abundant gas vesicles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>) and ultrasound contrast (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4, c-d</ref>).</s><s>For comparison, we transformed EcN cells with the luminescence operon LuxABCDE (LUX), which has previously been used to visualize gene expression in microbial populations in vivo using bioluminescent imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>LUX-expressing EcN cells produced no ultrasound contrast (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4, c-d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To establish a proof of concept for ultrasound imaging of ARG-expressing bacteria within the GI tract, and to compare the result to bioluminescent imaging, we introduced EcN cells expressing ARG1 or LUX into the colons of anesthetized mice.</s><s>To assess the ability of each modality to resolve the spatial distribution of bacteria within the colon, we injected the ARG1 and LUX cells in the center or periphery of the colonic lumen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4, e-h</ref>).</s><s>Ultrasound images clearly revealed the localization of ARG-expressing EcN cells in the appropriate region of the colon (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>, e and g) at concentrations of 10 9 cells/ml -within the range of certain commensal and therapeutic scenarios, and below the density reached by EcN in gnotobiotic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, bioluminescent images showed only that the bacteria are present somewhere in the mouse abdomen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4, f</ref> and<ref type="figure">h</ref>).</s><s>To facilitate visualization of ARG-specific signals, our ultrasound image analysis used background subtraction following gas vesicle collapse, with the resulting contrast overlaid on grayscale anatomical images to show the location of the bacteria within the context of other internal organs.</s><s>Alternatively, ARG-expressing cells can also be seen in the colon in raw ultrasound images (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Contrast from colon-localized E. coli was consistent across mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>These results establish the ability of ARGs to make genetically labeled microbes visible noninvasively in deep tissue, and demonstrate the advantage of ultrasound relative to optical imaging in terms of spatial localization within deep organs.</s><s>Some degree of burden is expected to accompany heterologous protein expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>To assess the burden on EcN cells presented by ARG1, we characterized their growth, viability, reporter expression maintenance, and release of microcins.</s><s>We observed that ARG1 expression is generally well tolerated, with some scope for optimization (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, Supplementary Note 2).</s></p><p><s>In addition to the GI tract, another emerging application of engineered microbes is as antitumor therapies and diagnostics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>To test whether such microbes could be imaged with ultrasound, and assess whether ARGs could be generalized to additional species besides E. coli, we adapted the genetic construct encoding ARG1 for expression in the attenuated, tumor-homing S. typhimurium strain ELH1301 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , and showed that we could image these cells following injection into tumors (Supplementary Note 3, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">9</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finally, to facilitate future genetic engineering of ARGs, we assessed the amenability of these constructs to high throughput screening.</s><s>In fluorescent protein engineering, directed evolution has served as an effective approach to identify variants with new spectral and biochemical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , often using mutant bacterial colonies as a convenient platform for high-throughput screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>To determine whether a similar approach could be used with ARGs, we developed a method to scan bacterial colonies with ultrasound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>).</s><s>In this method, colonies are immobilized on agar plates with an over-layer of agarose, then scanned with an ultrasound transducer translated by a computer-controlled robot.</s><s>This results in a series of transverse images that can be reconstructed to from an in-plane image of the plate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>).</s><s>We used this technique to image a mixed plate of E. coli transformed with ARG1, ARG2 or GFP.</s><s>Serial acoustic collapse imaging (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>) revealed three distinct colony populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref>), allowing the genotypes to be distinguished from each other with 100% accuracy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5d</ref>).</s><s>This result suggests that colony screening can discriminate acoustic phenotypes with sufficient accuracy to serve as a highthroughput assay for acoustic protein engineering.</s></p><p><s>Our study establishes engineered gas vesicle gene clusters as the first reporter genes for ultrasound, giving this widely used noninvasive imaging modality the ability to visualize genetically modified bacteria inside living animals.</s><s>Future work will build on the in vitro and in vivo proofs of concept presented in this study to answer scientific and translational questions.</s><s>This research will benefit from the development of ultrasound techniques to optimally detect ARG signals and distinguish them from background (Supplementary Note 4), further genetic engineering to optimize the stability and host burden of ARG constructs, and expression of these reporters in a broader range of microbial species (Supplementary Note 5).</s><s>In addition, it is ultimately desirable to express ARGs in mammalian cells, which will require a significant dedicated effort.</s></p><p><s>We anticipate that the ARGs presented in this work are only a starting point for future engineering of ultrasound reporter genes.</s><s>Since their initial discovery as optical reporters, fluorescent proteins have been engineered, evolved and used in thousands of unforeseen optical imaging applications.</s><s>Our findings that genetic engineering can be used to generate ARGs with distinct acoustic properties and that ARGs are amenable to colony-based highthroughput screening suggest that a similar trajectory may be available for this new technology.</s></p></div>
