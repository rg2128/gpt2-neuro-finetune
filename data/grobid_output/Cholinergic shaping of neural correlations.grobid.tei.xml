<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>The capacity of a network of neurons to represent the sensory world depends not only on the way individual neurons respond to sensory stimuli but also on the similarity of activity across neurons comprising the network.</s><s>This similarity can be quantified as the correlation of activity across neuronal pairs, or neural correlations.</s><s>This work presents a unique finding, demonstrating that a neuromodulator, in this case acetylcholine, can produce specific changes in the correlation structure of the cortical network that ultimately increase the encoding capacity of the network.</s></p><p><s>We define the signal-to-noise ratio as SN = σ 2 S =σ 2 ξ , where σ 2 S is the variance of the signal, or signal amplitude, and σ 2 ξ is the variance of the noise, or noise amplitude.</s><s>This definition of signal to noise can be understood as the ratio of the dynamic range of the neuronal responses over the amplitude of the noise.</s><s>It is directly linked to the information capacity of a single neuron <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and has been proposed as an appropriate measure to quantify neural coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>We found that optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons increased the amplitude of the neuronal signal (sign test, P &lt; 0.001 across bin sizes; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) but left the amplitude of the noise intact (sign test, P &gt; 0.1 across bin sizes; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (P &lt; 0.005 across all bin sizes; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>This specific effect of acetylcholine on the amplitude of the signal, but not the noise, has not been previously reported.</s><s>The observed increase in signal-to-noise ratio indicates that acetylcholine augments the encoding capacity of individual neurons.</s><s>The encoding capacity of the network, however, also depends on the correlation structure of the network.</s></p><p><s>Despite their putative importance in shaping the encoding capacity of a network, signal correlations are frequently overlooked, and this study analyzes their modulation by acetylcholine.</s><s>We calculated the signal correlation between each pair of neurons as the Pearson correlation between the pair's signals across all time bins <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</s><s>We did not find an effect of cholinergic stimulation on signal correlations (sign test;

0.001 across all bin sizes; Table <ref type="table">S3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), thereby suggesting an increase in the encoding capacity of the cortical network.</s></p><p><s>Although previous work suggests that a decrease in the correlation slope is beneficial for network encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, such work uses simulations in which all neurons have the same signal-tonoise ratio and similar (homogeneous) receptive fields; both are assumptions that can limit the validity of the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>To better understand the role of neural correlations in network encoding, we developed a technique that allows quantification of the network's encoding efficiency in terms of arbitrarily defined signal and noise covariance matrices, and that is applied to networks in which the neurons have Poisson statistics (SI Methods).</s><s>Because of limitations in the software and running time of the computationally heavy simulation, we limit the size of the simulated network to 25 neurons.</s><s>The essence of the technique is to generate a set of correlated signals and to use those signals to generate realizations of neural activity with correlated-Poisson (24) statistics.</s><s>Furthermore, we used Bayesian methods to estimate the probability of a stimulus given the neural response and quantifying the accuracy of this "ideal estimator."</s><s>This technique can be applied to investigate encoding efficiency for any possible covariance matrices.</s><s>In this work, we use it to evaluate the effect of the correlations' slope on encoding efficiency.</s><s>To do this, we generate a signal covariance matrix, and then we generate a noise covariance matrix such that the correlations' slope is high (SI Methods), and subsequently shuffle (to various degrees) the neurons' identities in the noise correlations matrix.</s><s>This manipulation has the advantage of changing the correlations' slope while keeping the internal structure of the signal and the noise correlations intact.</s><s>The accuracy of the estimator is quantified as the mean equivocation (SI Methods) over a set of realizations; a similar result is obtained when we use the success rate of a maximum likelihood predictor.</s><s>For all simulation parameter sets chosen, we robustly observe that, as the correlations' slope decreases, the encoding efficiency increases (P &lt;

0.05 for each set of parameters; SI Methods and Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In summary, during the animals' passive observance of visual stimuli, optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons modulated the cortical network by (i) increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of individual neurons, (ii) leaving the signal correlations intact, (iii) decreasing noise correlations, and (iv) reducing the dependence between signal and noise correlations (correlations' slope) in a manner that increases encoding efficiency.</s><s>Thus, our analyses demonstrated that acetylcholine can modulate the statistical dependencies of cortical neurons to increase the encoding capacity of the network.</s></p></div>
