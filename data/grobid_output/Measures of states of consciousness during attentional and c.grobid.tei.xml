<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The ability to objectively detect the presence, absence, level, or degree of consciousness in individuals is of both clinical and theoretical relevance.</s><s>Here, we focus on the most basic concept of consciousness, defined as phenomenological experience, or what it feels like for a person (or in general: a system) to be in a state, for example for a human to be happy.</s><s>Thus, if an individual or a system has any phenomenological experience at all, it is considered to be conscious.</s><s>It is generally assumed that humans are conscious when they report being conscious, and they are considered to be largely unconscious during dreamless states of sleep, general anesthesia, or during coma.</s><s>Several methods aiming at objectively assessing or quantifying the presence or absence of conscious or unconscious states, or the level or degree of consciousness, have been developed, based on various metrics such as behavior (i.e. the Glasgow Coma Scale; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Teasdale &amp; Jennett, 1974)</ref> , brain metabolism (i.e.</s><s>brain glucose consumption; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Shulman, Hyder, &amp; Rothman, 2009)</ref> , and electrophysiological activity (i.e. the electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BIS index; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Myles, Leslie, McNeil, Forbes, &amp; Chan, 2004)</ref> .</s><s>While several measures have shown promising results in being able to reliably distinguish awake states from states of general anesthesia or sleep, it's important to investigate whether and how they may change within each of these states.</s><s>For example, it's important that a clinical marker is not strongly affected by attention and other cognitive functions, which both can vary during normal wakefulness, and can be impaired in some groups of patients.</s></p><p><s>Two of the EEG-based measures inspired by theories of consciousness are the perturbational complexity index (PCI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Casali et al., 2013)</ref> and the P3b component of the sensory event related potentials (ERP) elicited by the so-called "global-local" oddball paradigm of sensory stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bekinschtein et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">King et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sergent, Baillet, &amp; Dehaene, 2005)</ref> .</s><s>The PCI is a measure based on quantifying the spatiotemporal complexity of the global EEG responses to local transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and is inspired by the integrated information theory of consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Oizumi, Albantakis, &amp; Tononi, 2014)</ref> .</s><s>The P3b ERP is a late EEG response reflecting detection of temporal pattern irregularities, usually elicited by the "auditory global-local" paradigm, and is inspired by the global neuronal workspace (GNW) theory of consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baars, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dehaene, Kerszberg, &amp; Changeux, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dehaene &amp; Naccache, 2001)</ref> .</s><s>However, in the original studies employing the auditory global local paradigm to elicit the P3b response, it was observed that participants doing a distracting task (or who were just allowed to mind-wander) during the paradigm, did not show the same response as those that specifically paid attention to the auditory stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bekinschtein et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">King et al., 2013)</ref> .</s><s>The authors argued that the P3b can be more correctly described as a marker of being conscious of specific content rather than being in a generally conscious state.</s><s>Thus, the presence of the P3b wave may be a strong indicator of conscious access or attention to a stimulus; but a lack of the P3b wave might only indicate faulty sensory processing, failure to follow commands, or internally generated conscious states like dreaming, and not indicate overall state unconsciousness per se.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, according to several studies, the PCI is apparently not dependent on or noticeably influenced by attending to any specific stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Casali et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Casarotto et al., 2016)</ref> .</s></p><p><s>However, the TMS method gives not only purely magnetic stimulations of the cortex, but is normally also accompanied by a high-frequency audible "click" as well as a noticeable somatosensory sensation caused by stimulation of nerves in the scalp.</s><s>While both sensations can be reduced by using noise masking and foam padding, respectively, they may still be perceived and are time-locked to the magnetic stimulation.</s><s>Therefore, it is conceivable that the EEG-responses to TMS may be contaminated by sensory responses to these TMS-related auditory and somatosensory stimuli.</s><s>There is currently disagreement to what extent such sensory contamination may occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Biabani, Fornito, Mutanen, Morrow, &amp; Rogasch, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Conde et al., 2019)</ref> , but if it's significant, it's possible that sufficient attentional distractions (such as concurrent task performance) might have similar effects on the TMS-evoked EEG responses as have been seen for the P3b.</s><s>However, the PCI measure has shown similar values in the dreaming state, when one is presumably unconscious of the TMS stimulations, as in the awake state <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Casarotto et al., 2016)</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, it seems improbable that attention towards sensory aspects of TMS stimulation affects PCI, when the TMS-EEG procedure is properly executed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Belardinelli et al., 2019)</ref> .</s><s>However, there is an alternative hypothesis: the observed difference in response to auditory pattern irregularities (P3b) might not only be modulated by attentional focus but also by the cognitive load and the use of attentional resources demanded by the task itself.</s></p><p><s>Both attentional and cognitive load can alter the underlying neural activity measured by EEG.</s><s>Focusing on different sensory modalities are linked to increased activations in the related primary and secondary sensory areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pessoa, Kastner, &amp; Ungerleider, 2003)</ref> , as well as different sensory related functional networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Smith et al., 2009)</ref> , while task engagement is linked to variations in power spectral density distributions in EEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hsieh, Ekstrom, &amp; Ranganath, 2011)</ref> , general task related networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fox et al., 2005)</ref> , as well as task specific modulation of activity in specific brain regions.</s><s>Such changes may contaminate measures of conscious and non-conscious states if they are sensitive to properties not specifically relevant for consciousness.</s><s>Therefore, it's important to verify that any measure of consciousness is at least independent of attentional focus and cognitive load.</s></p><p><s>This study aimed to investigate the effect of attentional and cognitive load modulation on PCI, P3b, and some other recently developed EEG-based measures that have shown promise for classification of states of consciousness;

<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schartner et al., 2015)</ref> .</s><s>In addition, we implemented a novel measure, based on directed functional connectivity estimated using the Directed Transfer Function (DTF;
