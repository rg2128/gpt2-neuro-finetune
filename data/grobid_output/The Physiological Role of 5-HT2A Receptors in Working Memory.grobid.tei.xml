<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has an essential role in the cognitive process of working memory, dysfunction of which is considered to be a core deficit in schizophrenia.</s><s>Although this cortical region is densely innervated with 5-HT 2A receptors to which atypical antipsychotic drugs bind with high affinity, little is known of the influence of this serotonin receptor subtype on prefrontal function.</s><s>We addressed this issue by examining the effects of iontophoresis of selective receptor ligands on prefrontal neurons possessing spatially tuned delay activity, or "memory fields," in monkeys performing a delayed-response task.</s><s>Memory fields of putative pyramidal cells were attenuated by iontophoresis of 5-HT 2A antagonists, which primarily produced a reduction in delay activity for preferred target locations.</s><s>Conversely, 5-HT 2A stimulation by ‚ê£-methyl-5-HT or 5-HT itself, accentuated the spatial tuning of these neurons by producing a modest increase in activity for preferred target locations and/or a reduction in activity for nonpreferred locations.</s><s>The agonist effects could be reversed by the selective antagonist MDL100,907, and were dose-dependent, such that high levels attenuated spatial tuning by profoundly reducing delay activity.</s><s>A role for feedforward inhibitory circuitry in these effects was supported by the finding that 5-HT 2A blockade also attenuated the memory fields of putative interneurons.</s><s>We conclude that prefrontal 5-HT 2A receptors have a hitherto unrecognized role in the cognitive function of working memory, which involves actions at both excitatory and inhibitory elements within local circuitry.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p><s>Use of animals.</s><s>Studies were performed on two adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), which were cared for under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and Yale Animal C are Committee.</s><s>They were prepared for chronic daily recording as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Funahashi et al., 1989)</ref>.</s><s>The recording cylinders were centered over the caudal principal sulcus using x-ray imaging and stereotaxic coordinates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> A) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Rao et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Magnetic resonance imaging in a number of recent monkeys has shown a high level of concordance in the coordinates used.</s><s>Single-unit recordings at this site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> B, central position) frequently reveal spatially tuned delay activity: the hallmark of response properties in caudal area 46 and rostral area 8a of <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Walker (1940)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>ODR task .</s><s>The animals were trained in a spatial ODR task shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Funahashi et al., 1989)</ref>.</s><s>In this task the monkey commences each trial by fixating a central stimulus (small square on monitor, or a light-emitting diode) within 2¬∞for 0.5 sec and must continue to fixate while one of 8 peripheral stimuli (45¬∞separation in circumference, 13¬∞e ccentricity) is illuminated for 0.5 sec (cue period).</s><s>There then follows a delay period of 2.5 or 3.0 sec during which the monkey must maintain fixation.</s><s>At the end of this time the central stimulus is extinguished, and the monkey must make a saccade, within 0.5 sec (response period), to the position of the peripheral stimulus shown earlier (again within 2¬∞) to be rewarded with fruit juice.</s><s>The peripheral cues were presented in a semirandom order across trials such that, during the delay period, the monkey had to remember the cue location shown within the present trial to make the correct response.</s><s>Note that the response period can be divided into a presaccadic epoch (lasting 250 msec from the end of the delay) because this incorporates the typical time required to initiate a saccade in this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Funahashi et al., 1991)</ref>, and a postsaccadic epoch (lasting 500 msec) starting 500 msec after the end of the delay and therefore, by definition, after the performance of a successf ul saccade.</s></p><p><s>Electrode design and construction.</s><s>Electrodes were constructed either from 33 m carbon fiber (AVC O, L owell M A) inside quad-barreled glass (C lark Electromedical Instruments, Reading, UK) or, more commonly, from 20 m pitch carbon fiber (EL SI, San Diego, CA) inserted into the center of seven barrel nonfilamented capillary glass (Friedrich and Dimmock, Millville, NJ).</s><s>The assembly was pulled through a heating coil element (nichrome wire; Narashige, Tokyo, Japan) using a proprietary, computer-controlled electrode puller.</s><s>The latter allowed for the precise control of the heating-coil temperature, the time and velocity required to pull the shaft of the electrode (60 -62 mm in length), and the timing of the solenoid used to pull the tip of the electrode.</s><s>The tip was f urther fashioned by a combination of spark etching and beveling on diamond (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) and stone (polishing) wheels.</s><s>This helped to produce sharp tips, 20 -40 m, in length with impedances ranging from 250 k‚çÄ to 1.2 M‚çÄ (at 1 kHz) and a noise level of œΩ15 V peak to peak.</s><s>E xtracellular voltage was recorded with a custom (SK Y-L AB) low-noise preamplifier and was bandpass filtered between 180 Hz and 8 kHz (four pole Butterworth; Krohn-Hite, Avon, M A).</s><s>At the beginning of each track, the dura was punctured with a 25 gauge hypodermic stainless steel guide tube (projecting from a 21 gauge guide tube), within which the electrode was lowered slowly into the brain using a MD-2 motorized hydraulic drive mounted on an MO-95 micromanipulator (Narishige).</s></p><p><s>Pharmacolog ical agents and iontophoresis.</s><s>In these and previous studies, we have focused on the effects of ligands that act as antagonists at particular receptors rather than agonist drugs.</s><s>This is because the phys- iological activation by neurotransmitters at their designated receptors at particular locations on different neurons, and with a particular time course, can be best studied by examining the consequences of removing that action.</s><s>Iontophoresis of an agonist may level the normal spatial and temporal profile of receptor action and, consequently, could obscure its f unctional significance.</s><s>The drugs used in this study have well documented affinities at 5-HT 2A receptors.</s><s>MDL 100,907 (Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) has high affinity (œΩ1 nM) at 5-HT 2A receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Johnson et al., 1996)</ref>, whereas ritanserin (Janssen Pharmaceutical, Titusville, NJ) and LY53857 (Sigma / RBI, Natick, M A) have an order of magnitude higher affinity at 5-HT 2A receptors (œΩ10 nM) than at 5-HT 2C receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Schreiber et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mazzola-Pomietto et al., 1996)</ref>.</s><s>The partial agonist ‚ê£-methyl-5-HT (Sigma / RBI), which has high affinity at 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity at 5-HT2C receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Garnovskaya et al., 1995)</ref>, was used to compare with, or reverse, the action of the antagonists.</s><s>Serotonin (HC l salt; Sigma / RBI) was also used in some experiments to compare the actions of endogenous and exogenous agonists.</s><s>The drugs were dissolved in 1 ml of triple distilled water (adjusted with HC l to pH 3.5-4.0)</s><s>at a concentration of œ≥ 0.01 M and stored in aliquots of 50 l at œ™70¬∞C.</s><s>Immediately before use, the drugs were sonicated briefly and drawn up into fine, f used-silica glass pipette fillers (W PI, Sarasota, FL), each instilled into one barrel of quad electrodes or two adjacent barrels of seven barrel electrodes, and forced to the tip by compressed air.</s><s>Thus, three drugs could be tested with one electrode, typically one agonist and two antagonists.</s><s>Teflon-coated platinum -iridium wires (Medwire, Mt.</s><s>Vernon, N Y) were then fitted inside each drug barrel and connected to a Neurophore BH2 iontophoretic system (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, N Y) such that one channel (I P-2) of the device controlled the delivery of one drug.</s><s>The results presented here are taken from findings with ejection currents ranging from 5 to 100 nA.</s><s>Retaining currents of œ™3 to œ™5 nA were used in a cycled manner (1 sec on, 1 sec off) when not applying drugs, and current balancing was not required because of the low impedance of the electrode.</s><s>Drug ejection did not create noise in the recording, and there was no systematic change in either spike amplitude or time course at any ejection current.</s><s>Iontophoresis was started after a sufficient number of trials (’Ü8) had been collected for each target position in the task under the control condition.</s></p><p><s>Data acquisition and anal ysis.</s><s>Eye movements were monitored with a magnetic search coil system (C NC Engineering, Seattle, WA) or by infrared pupil tracking (ISCAN, Burlington, M A).</s><s>These data were incorporated into task control, performed by a PDP-11 running MON K software or by a personal computer running TEM PO (Reflective Computing, St. L ouis, MO).</s><s>Spike waveform-sorting and data acquisition was run on a micro1401 using Spike2 software (C ambridge Electronic Design, C ambridge, UK).</s><s>Waveform sorting (template matching algorithm) made it possible to isolate up more than one unit at the same recording site.</s><s>The waveform templates constructed in the sorting were of sufficient range in amplitude that they could incorporate any moment by moment change in the magnitude of the spikes or slow drift in spike amplitude over time.</s><s>The data collected from each unit was time-stamped (and the spike waveform stored) to precisely determine when each spike occurred relative to task events, and output via a text file for subsequent analysis.</s><s>Unit activity was measured in spikes per second during each epoch of the trial (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Data were first collected from the cell under a control condition, followed by a drug condition in which one of the 5-HT 2A ligands was applied, and then typically a recovery condition after drug application had been terminated.</s><s>Because the synthetic, high-affinity drugs used in these experiments take many seconds to act, they can also take a long time to wear off.</s><s>Thus, although the general activity level of the cell may f ully return to normal by the end of the recovery condition, the value obtained for spatial tuning over the entire condition can only approach that in control (because multiple trials for each target direction are required in the analysis).</s><s>However, in some recordings we used a post-drug condition immediately after drug application to ensure an optimal recovery condition afterwards.</s><s>Occasionally dose-dependent effects of the drug were tested in two or more consecutive conditions, or an agonist was applied in the condition immediately after application of an antagonist (and vice versa) to detect reversal or opposing effects.</s><s>Data were obtained from at least five trials (typically 10 or more) at each cue location for each condition.</s><s>The first 30 -90 sec of data (or originally data from the first trial at each cue location) from noncontrol conditions was omitted from the text file to allow for the time taken for drug action.</s><s>The text file data were processed by a proprietary Cœ©œ© program for statistical analysis using the Student's two-tailed t test with unequal variance and an ‚ê£ of 5%.</s><s>In this way, data with a statistical probability level of œΩ 0.05 were obtained for neuronal activity within each epoch of the task in comparison to baseline activity, and the effects of drug application on unit activity within each period of the task in comparison with the previous control condition.</s><s>Population analysis was performed on normalized data, derived by first aligning the preferred directions of the population of tuned cells to 0¬∞.</s><s>The mean firing rate for each target location for each unit was then taken as a ratio to the mean activity over all target locations and plotted relative to the preferred direction.</s><s>A similar analysis was performed for the percentage change in activity between drug and control conditions for each target location.</s><s>One-way and two-way ANOVAs were performed on this normalized data, and the results were analyzed with post hoc Scheffe tests.</s></p><p><s>Identification of single units.</s><s>As previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Mountcastle et al., 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wilson et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rao et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rao et al., , 2000))</ref>, it was possible to identif y two distinct putative cell types in vivo by measuring the time course of their spike waveforms.</s><s>Fast-spiking (FS) neurons had relatively low-amplitude spikes (typically œΩ50 V), biphasic action potentials, relatively high firing rates, and short spike durations of œΩ 0.9 msec.</s><s>Regular-spiking (RS) neurons typically had more complex triphasic waveforms with a larger initial negative deflection, relatively low basal firing rates, and long durations of typically œæ1 msec.</s><s>FS units could only be tracked for typically œΩ20 m, whereas RS units could often be tracked for œæ100 m, a distinction that probably arises from the larger dendritic field of pyramidal cells.</s><s>Using a cutoff point of 0.9 msec spike-based width (the extracellular impulse being a close corollary to the first order differential of the action potential recorded intracellularly) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McCormick et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kawaguchi, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kawaguchi, , 1995))</ref>, the two cell types could be readily segregated, in accordance with their other spike properties.</s><s>A recent report by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gur et al. (1999)</ref>, recording from macaque V1 neurons, provides support for the assumption that units with different spike properties are likely to originate from cells of different types, which also show different physiological properties, as recognized in many previous in vivo rodent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Simons, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Swadlow et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Shimegi et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dantzker and C allaway, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Morris and Henderson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baeg et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Timofeev et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>For f urther details on the unit isolation and spike segregation used, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rao et al.

target="#b2">(Aghajanian and Marek, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Prefrontal dysfunction is also implicated in depression, in which there is evidence that stimulation of 5-HT receptors may be so low as to result in reduced cerebral blood flow in prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bremner et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Smith et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Treatment of this insufficiency by serotonin reuptake blockers can reinstate normal blood flow in the frontal lobes, indicating the requirement for serotonergic facilitation of neuronal activity for proper function of this brain region.</s><s>Therefore, our results support the proposal that 5-HT 2A signaling may also play an important role in the amelioration of cognitive function in this mental disorder <ref

point to a beneficial role for 5-HT 2A receptors in the working memory process in primates performing a well learned task, although it remains to be seen whether increased activation of this serotonin receptor subtype could actually lead to disruption of mnemonic processing when task demands increase.</s><s>Hence, our results support the assertion that alterations in 5-HT 2A receptor signaling may be a contributing factor to the development of cognitive dysfunction in mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression, and thus, may provide an important target for drug therapy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Region of recording and experimental
