<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p><s>Three rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), B, C and D, were used as subjects in this study.</s><s>All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the National Eye Institute and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the Public Health Service Policy on the humane care and use of laboratory animals.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY</head><p><s>One recording chamber was placed over the midline of the occipital cortex, tilted posteriorly by 40 • , and was aimed at the LHb; another chamber for the stimulating electrode was placed over the frontoparietal cortex, tilted laterally by 35 • , and was aimed at the GPi.</s><s>Recordings and electrical stimulations were performed using tungsten electrodes (Frederick Haer) that were advanced by an oil-driven micromanipulator (MO-97A, Narishige).</s><s>The recording and stimulation sites were determined using a grid system, which allowed recordings at every 1 mm between penetrations.</s><s>An electrode was introduced into the brain through a stainless steel guide tube, which was inserted into one of the grid holes and then to the brain via the dura.</s><s>We preferentially recorded multi-unit activity in the LHb using electrodes with low impedances (about 0.5 M Ohm).</s><s>The signal was amplified with a band-pass filter (200 Hz-5 kHz; BAK, Mount Airy, MD) and collected at 40 kHz via a custom-made window discriminator (MEX).</s><s>Single neurons were isolated online using a custom voltage-time window discrimination software (MEX, LSR/NEI/NIH).</s></p><p><s>To record LHb activity, the position of the LHb was mapped first by MRI.</s><s>The electrophysiological features of the LHb <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007)</ref> were also used to locate the LHb.</s><s>To examine the basal ganglia's influence on the LHb, electric stimulations were applied to the basal ganglia while recording multi-unit activity from the LHb (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In most cases we used 1 biphasic pulse of 100 µA lasting 0.2 ms.</s><s>We chose these parameters because it was shown previously that stimulation with similar parameters in the CN in awake monkeys produced significant effects on single neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hikosaka et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>However, single pulse stimulation in the striatum often elicited only weak effects on LHb neurons.</s><s>For this reason, we used three biphasic pulses of 133 µA each lasting 0.2 ms at 300 Hz (for the striatum only).</s><s>The inter-stimulation interval was about 1 sec with some variability.</s><s>The stimulation-triggered LHb activity was stored and analyzed offline.</s><s>To see the effect of stimulation at different structures of the basal ganglia, stimulations were applied 100 times at every 200 µm along the electrode penetration.</s><s>To minimize stimulation-induced electrical artifacts, we used a commercially available artifact remover (Artifact Zapper-1, Riverband Instrument).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA ANALYSIS</head><p><s>At the end of each penetration, a map of effective stimulation sites was made by averaging the 100 times of stimulating effect at every 200 µm along the whole tract.</s><s>At each depth of stimulation, LHb neuron activity during the 200 ms period preceding the stimulation onset was analyzed to generate a 95% confidence threshold.</s><s>The threshold was used to determine the significant deviation of LHb activity after stimulation.</s><s>In the center figures of Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, significant excitations are shown in white and significant inhibitions are shown in black.</s></p><p><s>To determine the latency of the stimulation-induced response of LHb neurons, we used a Poisson distribution test <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hong et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>For this, we first counted the number of accumulated spikes across the trials within a 1 ms bin along the 500 ms period before stimulation.</s><s>Using these data, a histogram was constructed, with the abscissa representing the number of spikes and the ordinate representing the number of bins that had the number of spikes corresponding to the values on the abscissa.</s><s>The histogram was fitted with a Poisson distribution curve.</s><s>Using the Poisson curve, the threshold value of spikes per bin was determined that matched the p value of 0.01.</s><s>Then, the number of spikes of each bin during the post-stimulation period was examined.</s><s>The point in time when the histogram exceeded the significance level was taken to be the time of significant modulation by the stimulation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>To examine the basal ganglia's influence on the LHb, electric stimulation was applied in the basal ganglia while recording multi-unit activity from the LHb.</s><s>Across the experiments, the stimulating electrode was aimed at different positions of the striatum, while the recording electrode was aimed at the LHb on the same side.</s><s>We monitored multi-unit activity, rather than single-unit activity, for two reasons.</s><s>First, LHb neurons show very similar activity in relation to changes in reward values (Matsumoto and Hikosaka,</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2007</head><p><s>).</s><s>Second, multi-unit activity remained more stable even when the recording lasted several hours.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> shows the effects of electrical stimulations (one biphasic 100 µA pulse of 0.2 ms duration) along the electrode track traveling through the putamen, GPe, and GPi.</s><s>The stimulation effect changed dramatically with the depth of the stimulating electrode.</s><s>Stimulations in the putamen induced little effect.</s><s>As the stimulating position moved closer to the border part between the putamen and GPe, a small excitatory effect appeared about 35 ms after the stimulation.</s><s>As the stimulating electrode approached the GPe, inhibitory and then excitatory effects appeared with shorter latencies (about 25 ms).</s><s>In the dorsal part of the GPe, however, there was little stimulation effect.</s><s>In the ventral GPe, an excitatory effect appeared at about 20 ms.</s><s>Interest-ingly, as soon as the electrode came out of the GPe and entered the GPe-GPi border region (GPb), a strong phasic excitatory response occurred with a short latency (5 ms), which was followed by an inhibition.</s><s>The phasic excitation continued throughout the GPi and further into a region ventral to the GPi (which may also belong to the GPb).</s><s>The data suggest that LHb neurons receive excitatory or inhibitory inputs from different regions in the basal ganglia and that their sources were distributed in a patchy manner.</s></p><p><s>Another source of short latency responses was found in the VP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>The stimulating electrode passed along the lateral edge of the putamen, the anterior part of the GPe, the anterior commissure (AC), and reached the VP.</s><s>The stimulation effect was mostly confined in the VP and was an inhibitory response that started about 15 ms after the stimulation and lasted about 40 ms.</s><s>Stimulation in the striatum elicited diverse effects in the multi-unit LHb activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Excitatory responses were evoked from patchy areas in the putamen, in its rostral portion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) and central portion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) (latencies: 30-40 ms).</s><s>Inhibitory responses with shorter latencies (15-25 ms) were evoked from the ventral portion of the central putamen, close to the transition to the GPe (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Stimulations in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), evoked inhibitory responses (latencies: 50-70 ms) followed by an excitation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, center).</s><s>Stimulations in the rostral portion of the caudate nucleus (CN) evoked excitatory responses with different latencies (dorsal CN: 60 ms, ventral CN: 30-40 ms).</s><s>Overall, the effective sites of stimulation were distributed in a patchy manner in the striatum.</s><s>Their effects (i.e., combination of excitatory and inhibitory effects) and latencies were variable across the patches.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
