may define a basal activity level in neurons for example, and a corresponding transcriptomic profile.</s></p><p><s>We tested the first hypothesis by evaluating whether OR genes sharing a common enhancer are transcriptionally closer to each other than to those under the control of other cis-regulatory elements.</s><s>We took advantage of two well defined cis-regulatory elements acting on mouse OR genes (the H and P elements), whose OR gene targets are quite dissimilar (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-d</ref>), and have been well described <ref type="bibr"

target="#fig_1">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>No increase in transcriptomic similarity was observed between genes under the control of the H or P elements.</s><s>To further explore this hypothesis, we took a global approach based on the possible link between the genomic distance separating OR genes and their difference in transcriptomic identity, the idea being again that since olfactory cisregulatory elements act on adjacent genes, those located in proximity may also result closer transcriptionally.</s><s>Pairwise genomic distances between OR genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) were calculated for all pairs of genes located in the same gene cluster and compared to the transcriptomic distance between the OSN populations expressing these ORs.</s><s>A weak positive association between genomic and transcriptomic proximity was observed in the first 30% of the genomic distance value range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8f</ref>).</s><s>This association decreased when using a binning based on the intergenic distance between OR genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) and including approximately the first 10% of the genomic distance value range.</s><s>This relationship was more visible when considering different equal width bins of the observed range of transcriptomic distances, in relation to the proportion of pairs of neighboring genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We then evaluated our second hypothesis, which proposes that the ORs themselves define transcriptomic profiles.</s><s>We determined the levels of sequence homology between ORs using Miyata scores (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8e</ref>) and tested their potential association with the transcriptomic distances between the corresponding neuronal populations.</s><s>We found a positive association between transcriptomic proximity and OR sequence similarity in the first 30% of the amino acid difference value range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8g</ref>), that was further supported by a clear overrepresentation of similar OR pairs in sensory populations that are transcriptionally close (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8e</ref>).</s><s>Given this last observation and knowing that OR genes tend to duplicate in cis, it is likely that sequence identity is a confounding factor when measuring genomic proximity.</s><s>To reevaluate whether genomic proximity plays indeed a role in addition to receptor identity, we took advantage of evolutionary accidents that led duplicated OR genes to land in close vicinity or distantly from their princeps allele.</s><s>We thus evaluated the potential differences in transcriptional proximity between neuronal populations expressing ORs that are similar and associated in the genome, and neuronal populations expressing ORs that are similar but located in different gene clusters.</s><s>In parallel, we evaluated the transcriptomic distances of neuronal populations expressing ORs that are dissimilar and are associated in the genome (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>We found no significant difference in the average transcriptional distance between neurons expressing similar OR genes, whether these genes are located in proximity or are distant from each other.</s><s>On the contrary, we found an increase in transcriptomic distances between dissimilar and similar ORs associated in the genome, supporting our second hypothesis, that is a role played by the OR identity in transcriptome determination.</s></p><p><s>Activity-induced transcriptomic modulation in defined OSN populations.</s><s>Following the identification of specific transcriptomic identities characterizing the different olfactory neuronal populations at rest, we explored their potential evolution after agonist activation.</s><s>To address this question, we determined the transcriptome of defined and well described

Olfr151 and Olfr16, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>To extract the most possible transcriptomic information, we did not opt here for a scRNA-seq approach but rather for the bulk sequencing of purified neuronal populations.</s><s>Following exposure, fluorescent Olfr151-and Olfr16expressing neurons were isolated by FACS, and their transcriptomes were determined and analyzed.</s><s>In all conditions, high amounts of transcripts of the OR gene corresponding to the targeted population were detected and sequence reads from other OR genes were almost absent (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Significant and robust transcriptomic modulations were observed for both

Olfr16-transcribing neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d-g, j-m</ref> and Supplementary Data 1).</s><s>The fold-change modulation ranged from 0.032 to 1505 and from 0.056 to 517 in the Olfr151-and

neurons were significantly dissimilar (882 genes were differentially expressed between the two neuron populations (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b-e</ref>).</s><s>Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations, several genes related to axon guidance were identified, such as Pcdh7, Pcdh9, Nrp1, and Sema7A (Supplementary Data 2).</s></p><p><s>We then compared the activity-induced modulated genes between the Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations (Fig. <ref type="figure">4f-h</ref>), that without surprise, showed again a significant difference between populations.</s><s>A principal component analysis (PCA) of the Olfr151 and Olfr16 transcriptomic sets, before and after agonist exposure, showed 39% of variance explained by cell identity, and 20% of variance by activity.</s><s>The overlap between the activity-induced responses of the Olf151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations was further explored by comparing their potentially common down and upregulated genes.</s><s>A significant proportion of these genes were shared, 215 (51.3%) and 134 (37.6%) of them being commonly upregulated and downregulated, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">4i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In both Olfr151-and Olfr16-activated populations, the dispersion of downregulated genes decreased, while it increased for upregulated genes; this was also true for the genes shared by both populations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>).</s><s>We then aimed to functionally interpret our data by attributing Gene Ontology (GO) terms to the activity-dependent modulated genes common to the Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations.</s><s>Among the significantly enriched terms, we found "signaling" and "Gprotein-coupled receptor activity" in the GO biological processes terms, "molecular transducer activity" in the GO molecular functions category, and "plasma membrane" and "cell periphery" in the GO cellular components category (Fig. <ref type="figure">4j</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>A pattern thus emerged, pointing to actors of the transduction cascade being modulated by agonist exposure.</s></p><p><s>We finally looked at genes that were modulated after activation in one OSN population and not in the other (fold change after activation &lt; 0.5 for downregulated genes and &gt;2 for upregulated genes, Supplementary Data 3).</s><s>Among these genes, we observed that a large proportion encoded transcription factors (8.2% and 7.1% for Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing populations, respectively, to be compared to 5% observed in commonly modulated genes).</s><s>Modulation of transcription following odorant exposure.</s></p><p><s>Modulations in mRNA concentration may result from various processes.</s><s>Among them and first in line, the regulation of transcriptional activity and the modulation of mRNA half-life.</s><s>Our previous work has pointed to a rapid downregulation of OR gene mRNA concentration following odor exposure (as fast as 20 min), and in some cases an almost absence of OR mRNA 5 h after stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>This nearly immediate modulation and complete loss of messenger is suggestive, or at least compatible with an active degradation of cytosolic mRNAs.</s><s>To explore this question, we took advantage of the different characteristics of nascent and mature mRNAs, namely the presence and lack of intronic sequences, respectively.</s><s>We first analyzed the exonic versus intronic reads of the modulated genes that we identified after odorant exposure of Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>Following agonist exposure, a large portion of the genes whose modulation was determined after analysis of exonic reads, were also modulated, both up and down and in both Olfr151-and Olfr16-transcribing neurons, when restricting the analysis to intronic reads (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>-g and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>).</s><s>To further explore this question, we exposed wild type mice to ethyl isobutyrate (Fig. <ref type="figure">5h</ref>), an agonist for which we previously determined a set of highly responsive OR genes, among which Olfr60, Olfr166, Olfr169, and Olfr171, whose corresponding mRNA concentrations drastically decrease after exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>We evaluated this potential modulation at the level of nascent mRNAs.</s><s>We observed a downregulation of OR mRNAs that was similar using exonic and intronic reads as readouts (Fig. <ref type="figure">5i</ref>) (although, for some OR genes, the number of intronic reads in the bulk RNA-seq was too low to evaluate differential expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref>)).</s><s>Finally, we looked at the cellular localization of transcripts (Fig. <ref type="figure">5h</ref>).</s><s>We took advantage of the high level of OR transcription that makes nascent transcripts easily visualized using in situ hybridization.</s><s>Since OR genes are transcribed monoallelically, a single nuclear transcriptional spot corresponding to their expressed OR gene is observed in the nucleus of each sensory neuron (Fig. <ref type="figure">5j</ref>).</s><s>We exposed wild type mice to ethyl isobutyrate and performed in situ hybridizations with a probe specific for Olfr171, whose mRNA we previously showed to be modulated following ethyl isobutyrate stimulation.</s><s>We quantified the intensity of the nuclear signal, before and after agonist exposure, and found a significant decrease in signal intensity after ethyl isobutyrate exposure (Fig. <ref type="figure">5j</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these data all point to an odorant-induced modulation of transcription, and not to a mechanism involving degradation or stabilization of mature mRNAs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this work, we took advantage of the unique opportunity provided by the mouse olfactory epithelium, which contains hundreds of singular cell subpopulations, each defined by the expression of a known chemoreceptor gene, and activable at will.</s><s>We first characterized the transcriptomes of these subpopulations in a basal state, at rest, that is in mice living in their usual environment without exposure to specific olfactory stimuli.</s><s>Second, by activating defined OSN subpopulations in vivo using odorants, we further explored how these neurons adapt to environmental changes.</s><s>We found that the transcriptomic identity of mouse OSNs is remarkably variable, a variability that results from the apparent interplay of two dimensions: a first, steady state transcriptomic identity that characterizes each OSN population, to which a second is added, following the recent odor-driven activity of the sensory neuron.</s><s>What does determine the transcriptomic identities of OSN populations?</s><s>It is the expressed OR that appears to be the main factor in the establishment of these identities.</s><s>Our data indeed show that transcriptomic similarities are better predicted by receptor similarities than by shared OR regulatory sequences.</s><s>In agreement with our data, the importance of the OR in the establishment of the transcriptional identity was shown in a recently published manuscript <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We showed here that odorant recognition triggers OSN transcriptomic modulation, that not only includes the downregulation of the expressed OR genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , but the up-and downregulation of hundreds of additional ones.</s><s>By comparing the agonist response of two olfactory populations expressing different ORs and responding to different odorants, we found a significant overlap between activity-modulated genes.</s><s>These represent late responsive genes (in opposition to early response genes), typically encoding proteins that regulate dendritic growth, synapse elimination or spine maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>For example, a gene that was significantly upregulated in both Olfr151-and Olfr16-populations upon activation was the late responsive gene Mustn1, whose transcription is regulated by immediate early genes including c-Fos and JunD 36 .</s><s>Mustn1 may constitute an activity marker in OSNs, although additional experiments would be required to generalize this observation.</s><s>More generally, in our case most modulated genes pertain to signal transduction categories, which possibly reflects the peculiarly ordered and relatively invariant olfactory circuitry.</s><s>Interestingly, among the main genes involved in the olfactory transduction cascade, including those coding for ORs, GnaI, Adcy3, Cnga2, Cngb1b, or Cnga4, none were upregulated after odorant-mediated activation, and most were Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Odorant-induced transcriptomic modulations.</s><s>a Schematic of the experiment.</s><s>After being exposed

parallels the data presented by Tsukahara et al. in which most of these genes were also found modulated after naris occlusion and long-term odorant exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Such transcriptomic contraction affecting all members of the olfactory cascade suggests a functional transcriptional adaptation, leading in the case of a sustained odorant exposure to a decreased response to the experienced odor.</s><s>Such an adaptive mechanism would not be surprising, since functional plasticity of sensory inputs mediated by olfactory stimulation has been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We also report different transcriptomic identities of OSN populations at rest (that is in the absence of actively exposing mice to odors).</s><s>In this almost silent state, how does the olfactory receptor translate its identity to the OSNs that express it?</s><s>One may argue, as Tsukahara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> that some OSNs expressing -log 10 adjusted p-value Olfr16 specific ORs will fire in a nose even without experimental stimulation, as some volatile molecules are always present in the environment.</s><s>But we rather suggest that there is an inherent activity state that may characterize each sensory population at rest, that translates into a specific transcriptomic identity.</s><s>This last view is supported by the observation that the elimination of odorantinduced activity through naris occlusion does not abolish transcriptomic variability between OSN populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, also supporting this view, it was previously shown that OSN populations expressing different ORs exhibit different basal activity levels, that is levels of basal transduction activity and fluctuation of currents, which drive concomitant firing of action potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Even in the absence of odor-stimulation, OSNs are indeed characterized by high adenylate cyclase 3 activity and by large fluctuations in cAMP levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , both of which are suggestive of intrinsic OR activity.</s><s>An interesting candidate mechanism for the generation of such odorant receptor-dependent and odorant-independent graded cellular states is the agonist-independent natural basal activity of G-coupled receptors (GPCRs).</s><s>Both GPCRs and other ligandactivated receptors are indeed known to spontaneously oscillate between two conformations, one active and the other inactive, in the absence of ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> (in the presence of these latter, the receptors are stabilized in an active state <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> ).</s><s>For GPCRs, this effect was already observed over 30 years ago with the delta opioid receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Since then, and despite being often considered as noise, many more examples of such constitutive GPCR activity have been reported (with some receptors exhibiting high levels of agonistindependent activity such as the Ghrelin receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> ), as well as various diseases associated with GPCR mutations affecting this constitutive activity.</s><s>In the olfactory system, odorant-independent OSN basal activity has also been described in the context of axon guidance, where it plays an important role in regulating anterior-posterior targeting of OSN axons during development <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>Constitutive OR activity thus appears to produce several different cellular states, whose number would be sufficient for defining enough nonoverlapping neuronal categories to which distinctive rostrocaudal projection positions are assigned.</s><s>The extent to which odor-induced activity experienced during development may influence the establishment of the glomerular map in addition to intrinsic activity, remains to be explored in details.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we identified the process at the origin of the agonistinduced variations of mRNA concentrations, which appears not to involve the half-life of mRNAs nor the nuclear export of these latter, but the modulation of transcription itself.</s><s>Which molecular players are involved in this process is still unknown, but obvious candidates come to mind, such as the cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB), a transcription factor critical for activitydependent neuronal plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> that is involved in the activationinduced prolonged lifespan of OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The mammalian olfactory mucosa thus represents a multifunctional sensor whose neuronal elements, that use olfactory receptors as internal and external chemical probes, are in constant evolution, adapting to the world via the activation of largescale transcriptomic programs.</s><s>Whether this transcriptomic diversity and dynamics functionally parallels the one recently observed in some central structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> , and whether the molecular tools involved in transcriptomic adjustments are shared between different circuits, remains to be explored.</s><s>Given the transcriptomic diversity of neurons in the mammalian brain and knowing that 90% of non-sensory GPCRs are expressed in mammalian brains, the question is worth asking.</s></p></div>

OSN populations (defined by the OR gene they express) are transcriptionally dissimilar from each other, the pairwise transcriptomic Euclidean distances between pairs of OSNs were computed on the first 15 PCs of the mature OSN dataset devoid of OR gene counts (computed from the sctransformnormalized and integrated count matrix; see scRNA-seq data filtering for more details).</s><s>The Euclidean distances were calculated on the PC space used for clustering and UMAP representation, rather than the gene counts, to faithfully represent and quantify the co-clustering of OSNs expressing the same receptor observed in Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>.</s><s>Note that when the analysis was performed on the mature OSN dataset including the OR gene counts, the top 14 PCs were used (the right part of Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>; with OR genes).</s></p><p><s>In Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref> and Supplementary Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref>, pairwise Euclidean distances were calculated between pairs of OSNs pertaining to populations represented by at least 3 cells in the dataset.</s><s>These distances were sorted into two categories: distances between pairs of OSNs expressing the same olfactory receptor (intra) or pairs expressing different receptors (inter).</s><s>To compare and measure the dissimilarity between these two distributions of pairwise transcriptomic Euclidean distances, the Cohen's d was calculated between the intra and inter distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>) using the cohen.d</s><s>function of the effectsize R package version 0.8.1 with default settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, to test if the difference in the distributions of Euclidean distances between pairs of OSNs expressing the same or different olfactory receptors was not a random effect, we generated a permuted dataset by randomly redistributing the cell identities (and hence the corresponding OR identities) of the top 15 PCs and recalculated pairwise distances for OSNs with identical random identities (intra perm).</s><s>By iterating this process, the random distribution was estimated from 1000 permuted datasets.</s><s>As described above, the Cohen's d was then calculated between the intra or inter OSN population transcriptomic Euclidean distance distributions and each of the permuted distributions.</s><s>This resulted in 1000 Cohen's d values for each set of comparisons (i.e., intra versus intra perm and inter versus intra perm).</s><s>The two distributions of Cohen's d values were then compared using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</s><s>When this analysis was performed on each cluster separately, the original PC space was used for distance calculation but only the distances between cells from that given cluster were retained for the analysis, and the p values of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction method, as indicated in the figure legends.</s></p><p><s>Evaluation of the effect of PC choice on transcriptomic Euclidean distances between pairs of OSNs.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of the choice of PCs on the results obtained, the Cohen's d values were calculated to measure the dissimilarity between the distributions of intra and inter OSN population pairwise transcriptomic Euclidean distances, as described in the previous paragraph, when varying the number of top PCs used for the analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>We found that the discriminability between the intra and inter OSN population transcriptomic Euclidean distances reaches a plateau with the top 11 PCs (or higher), and the computational approach to select the top PCs for downstream analysis is robust and allows to capture most of the OSN population-based variance in the dataset.</s></p><p><s>Evaluation of the effect of dataset integration on transcriptomic Euclidean distances between pairs of OSNs.</s><s>Though dataset integration corrects for batch effects found in the data, it also alters the gene expression profile of the cells.</s><s>When dataset integration is performed, shared cell types are identified between datasets and their gene expression profiles are "corrected" (i.e., altered) so to remove batch effects that might hamper their co-clustering during downstream analysis.</s><s>Given the differences in the frequencies of OSN populations, dataset integration might impact differently small and large OSN populations.</s><s>For the large OSN populations, whose cells were sampled from most if not all mice, dataset integration might only correct for batch effects found between the individual datasets, as the search for common cell types (i.e., anchors) between the datasets might result in the identification of cells expressing the same OR.</s><s>This is not the case for small OSN populations whose cells are sampled from a few of the mice used in this experiment.</s><s>For example, an OSN population formed of 3 cells can be sampled from only one mouse, and therefore none of the datasets from the other mice would contain cells from that given population.</s><s>A byproduct of this could be the alteration of the transcriptomic profiles of two small OSN populations so to make them more similar for dataset integration, especially since the OR gene expression information was removed from the dataset, which could have helped to discriminate these two populations.</s><s>In other words, the neighbors of cells from a given small OSN population sampled from a given mouse can be identified as the cells pertaining to another small OSN population sampled from another mouse.</s><s>Hence, in this case, the search for neighbors between the datasets can be biased towards small OSN populations.</s><s>To evaluate this, OSN populations were binned based on their size into equal frequency bins and the two extreme bins (one formed by populations of small sizes, and the other of large sizes) were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>).</s><s>Subsequently, the inter OSN population pairwise transcriptomic distances between pairs of OSNs from each of the two bins were subsampled to include the distances between 1/3 of the OSNs from each population, and the subsampled distances were compared to each other and to all intra OSN population distances using Cohen's d as described above (see Transcriptomic Euclidean distance calculation between pairs of OSNs).</s><s>This process was repeated 10,000 times, hence resulting in 10,000 Cohen's d values for each set of comparisons (i.e., inter small versus inter large, inter small versus intra, and inter large versus intra) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In parallel, the analysis detailed in Transcriptomic Euclidean distance calculation between pairs of OSNs was also performed for each mouse without dataset integration (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Following PC selection using the kneed python package described above, the analysis was computed on the top 14 PCs for mouse 1, the top 12 PCs for mouse 2, the top 10 PCs for mouse 3, and the top 14 PCs for mouse 4.</s></p><p><s>Transcriptomic Euclidean distance calculation between OSN populations.</s><s>To compare the transcriptomic Euclidean distances between OSN populations with the genomic or phylogenetic distances between the olfactory receptors they express, population transcriptomic distances were calculated on the same PC space used for clustering and UMAP representation (i.e., top 15 PCs of the mature OSN dataset without OR gene counts).</s><s>To this end, OSN population centroids were estimated on the PC space and the distances between the centroids were used as a proxy for the distances between pairs of OSN populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>-g and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8d</ref>).</s><s>To reduce small sample biases in centroid estimations, this analysis was restricted to OSN populations represented by at least 10 cells in the dataset.</s></p><p><s>Functional OR gene identification and OR phylogeny.</s><s>The functional OR phylogeny was partly built from the same sequence set as used in von der Weid et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>To constitute this set, OR coding sequences were identified de novo in the mouse genome assembly GRCm38 using TBLASTN searches with previously annotated mouse OR protein sequences as queries.</s><s>The hits were manually curated to filter out putative non-functional receptors.</s><s>The criteria to consider an OR to be functional was the conservation of evolutionary constrained residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> , the integrity of the seven transmembrane domains and the absence of intron within the coding sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> , resulting in a set of 1141 putatively functional OR.</s><s>After this filtering, 11 filtered out ORs were retrieved as they were found to be expressed in a monoallelic fashion in one or more OSNs, in our scRNA-seq data.</s><s>For these ORs, we used coding sequences as annotated in Ensembl version 102.</s><s>Notably, 8 of these 11 ORs have their coding sequence spanning two exons, with most of the coding sequence (covering the seven transmembrane domains) included in the last exon.</s></p><p><s>A multiple sequence alignment including the resulting OR protein sequence set was obtained with Clustal Omega v1.2.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> , using the-full and-full-iter options.</s><s>The resulting alignment was trimmed to keep the sites between the most conserved start methionines and the last position with less than 90% of gaps.</s></p><p><s>The maximum likelihood phylogeny of the mouse functional ORs was calculated with Phyml version 20120412 <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> using the following parameters: -d aa -m JTT -f e -v e -c 4 -a e -s BEST -o tlr.</s><s>The resulting tree was rooted on the node at the origin of class I and class II ORs.</s><s>For display of transcriptomic identities of associated OR in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, each OSN population was assigned to the transcriptomic cluster to which the majority of cells belong.</s><s>In case of equivalences, we assigned the transcriptomic cluster randomly.</s><s>Branch tips were colored according to the assigned transcriptome cluster identity of OSNs expressing the corresponding OR.</s></p><p><s>Genomic distances and gene cluster definition.</s><s>Pairwise genomic distance between OR genes was measured as the distance in base pairs between start codons of OR genes.</s><s>For the 8 OR genes that have their start codon on another exon, we instead used the first position of the last coding exon.</s><s>Genomic distances were only obtained between genes in the same chromosome.</s></p><p><s>Pairwise distances between adjacent genes were used to aggregate OR genes in cluster.</s><s>For this, the sorted distances were split into two groups using the Jenks natural break optimization for k = 3.</s><s>In that manner, the middle break is used to separate unbiasedly two categories of distances: the smaller distances representing the intracluster distances and the longer distances representing the intercluster distances.</s><s>Next, we calculated the mean and the standard deviation of the intracluster distances and defined the clustering threshold as the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation.</s><s>Finally, gene clusters were obtained by aggregating neighboring genes whose genomic distance was closer to each other than the clustering threshold.</s></p><p><s>Amino acid difference metric.</s><s>Pairwise amino acid difference was measured on the protein alignment that was used for the phylogenetic reconstruction.</s><s>For a given pair of aligned sequences, each substitution was scored according to the Miyata amino acid replacement matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> .</s><s>Insertions were scored as the mean replacement scores of each additional amino acid.</s><s>The sum of these scores gave the pairwise amino acid difference.</s></p><p><s>Evaluation of genomic proximity and sequence identity as determinants for transcriptome identity.</s><s>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>, we defined thresholds of genomic distance and amino acid difference to attribute pairs of OSN populations as being close in terms of genomic proximity between the OR genes they express or in terms of sequence identity between their respective OR.</s><s>For genomic proximity, we evaluated all intergenic distances between neighboring ORs belonging to the same cluster and chose the 95th percentile of this distribution as the threshold value for a pair to be considered close.</s><s>For sequence identity, we evaluated all pairwise amino acid differences between ORs belonging to the same class and chose the 5th percentile of this distribution as the threshold value for a pair to be considered close.</s><s>For Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>, a pair was considered distant in terms of genomic proximity when the corresponding OR genes were located in different OR gene cluster.</s><s>A pair was considered distant in terms of sequence identity when the amino acid difference between their corresponding ORs was higher than the threshold used to identify the close pairs.</s><s>Chemicals.</s><s>Odorants were directly purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, ethyl isobutyrate (W242802), acetophenone (42163).</s><s>Lyral was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Christian Margot (Firmenich).</s></p><p><s>Odorant exposure.</s><s>For all odorant exposures, on the day preceding the odorant exposure mice were isolated and single-housed in a standard type II long cage.</s><s>Exposure assays started at 8:00 a.m. and lasted 5 h.</s><s>For the exposed condition, a cotton swab was imbibed with 200 µL of 5% odorant in a DMSO solution and was
