p &lt; 0.01; n = 20 astrocytes, 5 mice), likely reflecting merged events.</s><s>No change in Ca 2+ signals was observed by current injection via an open pipette, indicating that the astrocyte responses were not due to mechanical effects (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>; n = 20 astrocytes, 5 mice).</s><s>Furthermore, astrocytes responded similarly when either D1 or D2 MSNs were depolarized (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1A-S1C</ref>), likely reflecting developmental maturity in adult mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Martı ´n et al., 2015)</ref>, consistent with anatomical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Octeau et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>MSN depolarizationevoked astrocyte Ca 2+ signals were resistant to tetrodotoxin (TTX; 300 nM; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>; n = 21 astrocytes, 5 mice), which blocked all APs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1F</ref>).</s><s>However, astrocyte Ca 2+ signals were abolished by Cd 2+ (50 mM;

n = 20 astrocytes, 5 mice) increased astrocyte Ca 2+ signals (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1F</ref>; p &lt; 0.01).</s><s>The effect of baclofen was blocked by the GABA B receptor antagonist CGP55845 (10 mM;

and AAV2/5 GfaABC 1 D-Cre in relation to panels A-D: In data reported in the main text, we deleted GB1R from astrocytes using striatal AAV2/5 GfaABC 1 D-Cre microinjections.</s><s>We could identify astrocytes based on their bushy morphologies as well as by marker expression (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2B</ref>), and we could therefore easily monitor the consequences of deleting GB1Rs in single cell evaluations.</s><s>However, we could not use Gabbr1 f/f mice for astrocyte-selective evaluations of more complex phenomena such as animal behavior.</s><s>There are two reasons.</s><s>First, there is no Cre mouse line that targets only striatal astrocytes, and thus crossing Gabbr1 f/f mice with even the best available Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 mice would delete GB1Rs from all astrocytes in the CNS, and from all Aldh1l1-expressing cells in the periphery <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chai et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Srinivasan et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Such an approach would not allow meaningful assessment of astrocyte GB1Rs functions for striatum-dependent behaviors.</s><s>Second, we could not use AAV2/5 GfaABC 1 D-Cre microinjections, because as reported previously these viruses lead to low-level Cre expression within striatal neurons, which was sufficient to cause excision of floxed genomic sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Srinivasan et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>It is important to note, however, that the AAV2/5 GfaABC 1 D constructs do not lead to expression of other cargo such as reporters, channels and receptors in neurons (e.g., GFP, tdTomato, Kir4.1, DREADDS and GCaMP).</s><s>For these molecules, the AAVs are demonstrably astrocyte selective <ref type="bibr"

AAV2/5 and the GfaABC 1 D promoter favors for astrocytes, but prevents for neurons.</s><s>However, in the case of Cre expression, even a very low number of recombinase molecules are sufficient to cause excision of floxed genomic sequences, resulting in observable effects in both neurons and astrocytes, as previously shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Srinivasan et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>We report a specific set of experiments in panels A-D to document that the AAV constructs were astrocyte selective for reporter expression, but not for Cre-mediated excision of genomic sequences.</s><s>Reporter expression was observed in 86 ± 4% of astrocytes and no neurons (0%), but Cre-mediated excision was observed in 91 ± 3% of astrocytes and 61 ± 3% of striatal neurons (C-D, n = 4 mice for each).</s><s>For these reasons, we could not use the Gabbr1 f/f mice to evaluate reliably astrocyte GB1R contributions to mouse behavior.</s><s>We emphasize that these limitations of
