absent and is much larger in an awake animal.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, in mice undergoing go-no go learning the responses of MTs to rewarded and non-rewarded odors are extremely different.</s><s>Thus

unrewarded odor.</s><s>Importantly, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref> if the odor that was a rewarded is made an unrewarded odor the response is reversed.</s><s>This evidence strongly suggests that the positive response elicited by the odor does not reflect its identity, but rather whether that odor is rewarded as opposed to unrewarded.</s><s>As a result this shows that

are rate invariant over the complete breathing cycle, this neuronal population expresses fine temporal changes in firing within the sniff that contain sufficient information to be used to discriminate between different odorants <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gschwend et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This kind of subsniff temporal coding could then convey information about the odorant identity.</s><s>However whether this coding strategy is used in awake behaving animals need to be clarified in future studies.</s></p><p><s>Few studies have explored the role played by respiration in

in exploring behavior and actively sniffing, LFP recording of the OB exhibits a pronounced theta oscillation band (4-12 Hz) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kay et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the theta LFP oscillations and sniffs are somewhat related and it has been proposed that the sniff cycle could elicit the theta oscillation in the bulb.</s><s>This hypothesis is supported by findings that OSNs can function both as chemical and mechanical sensors generating sniffrelated output to the glomeruli even in the absence of odor presentation, and because the knockout of cycle nucleotide gated channel that blocks transduction in OSNs elicits inactivation of the theta LFP in the OB <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Grosmaitre et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In awake behaving animals, however, this strong correlation of sniff and theta LFP varies depending on the behavioral context.</s><s>For instance, in an experiment involving rats tracking odor trails, the correlation between sniff and theta oscillation was largely variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Khan et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, in a go-no go odor discrimination task, it was shown that odor learning was highly correlated with the coherence of the LFP in the OB and higher olfactory centers such as the dorsal hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kay, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Future studies should determine the theta oscillation/sniff relationship in go no-go and alternative forced choice discrimination tasks and whether variations in sniff/LFP relate to animal performance.</s></p><p><s>The gamma oscillation from the OB (40-90 Hz) usually appears at a specific phase of the sniff cycle, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cenier et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Manabe and Mori,

type="bibr">Aylwin, 2011, Manabe and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mori, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, high-frequency sniffing prolonged the overall response to odorants and increased the frequency of oscillation, indicating that highfrequency sniffing reduces the adaptation to continuous odorant stimulation.</s><s>Therefore, the modulation of sniff frequency on gamma oscillation may facilitate odorant memory formation for subsequent odorant identification.</s></p><p><s>The sniff coupled gamma oscillations from mitral vs. tufted cells are quite different at the temporal domain.</s><s>The gamma oscillations recorded from tufted cells are fast and at early phase of the sniff, while the gamma oscillations from mitral cells are slow and at late phase of the sniff <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Manabe and Mori, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The shift of gamma oscillations probably corresponds to the difference in activation timing of tufted cells and mitral cells.</s><s>This kind of sniff coupled gamma oscillation from different cell types is also dependent on brain states: both fast and slow gamma oscillations can be induced during awake state, while both oscillations failed to induce during slow wave and rapid-eye-movement sleep.</s><s>Interestingly the axons from mitral and tufted cells differ largely in their main targeting of piriform cortex as opposed to the olfactory tubercle <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Nagayama et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In general, sniff can shape gamma oscillations at a single cycle, and modulate the intensity and temporal
