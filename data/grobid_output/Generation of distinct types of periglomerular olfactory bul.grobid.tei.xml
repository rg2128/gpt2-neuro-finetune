not reflect a simple turnover of the whole interneuron population of the GL, but it may serve to finely modulate the relative amounts of distinct OB neuron subpopulations.</s><s>This is strengthened by comparison of the results obtained by FG injection into adult mice with data on the percentages of the different subpopulations in the OB GL <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Parrish-Aungst et al.,

SVZ progenitors with a PG fate is composed of a heterogeneous pool of neurochemically specified elements, and indicate that the relative contribution of these different subsets changes with time.</s><s>However, results obtained after SVZ progenitor transplantation partially diverge from those obtained by dye labeling.</s><s>In particular, different percentages of CB-or THpositive cells are found when dye injections in the neonate are compared with transplantation of neonatal SVZ.</s><s>These quantitative differences may be well related to the two experimental approaches.</s><s>Indeed, the procedures of dissociation and transplantation may favor the survival and/or engraftment of certain cell types, whereas dye injection and uptake may be differentially efficient on distinct progenitor subsets.</s><s>Such "selective" mechanisms would support the idea of intrinsically different subsets of progenitor cells destined to generate the variety of PG cell phenotypes.</s><s>In any case, although the absolute numbers observed in the transplants cannot be compared with those obtained by tracing endogenous precursors, both sets of results are consistent in showing some clear trends in the age-dependent production of specific phenotypes.</s><s>SVZ progenitors preferentially adopt the CB phenotype during embryonic life, whereas acquisition of the same identity gradually becomes less frequent during postnatal development and adulthood.</s><s>In contrast, the production of CRand TH-expressing PG cells follows an opposite trend with a progressive
