execution.</s><s>Due to the monosynaptic connections between cortex and the STN that make up the hyperdirect pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nambu et al., 2002)</ref>, unexpected sensory events (e.g., stop signals) can be quickly relayed through the STN to raise the decision threshold for ongoing action plans to prevent execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Wiecki and Frank,

original value.</s><s>However, some evidence suggests that STN exerts bidirectional control over decision threshold, capable of promoting the adoption of both speed and accuracy policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Herz et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, relating the adaptive threshold in the DPM to recordings in the STN will likely require a more nuanced approach to generalize beyond the current task.</s><s>Future studies will be needed to examine how these BG-mediated adaptation mechanisms are recruited to modify behavior, the relevant task dimensions they are sensitive to, and the extent to which they differ from cortical sources of feedback learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Purcell and Kiani, 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Considered in the context of the emerging literature on BG pathways, the current study highlights two distinct feedbackdependent learning mechanisms: (1) a gradual tuning of the execution drift rate that corrects for timing errors; and (2) a cautionary increase in the execution threshold following failed action inhibition.</s><s>While cognitive models, such as the adaptive DPM, are unable to capture the complexity of neural information processing that underlies adaptive action control, they do provide a rich description of the component operations, helping to guide study design and interpretation in experimental neuroscience.</s><s>Using a straightforward hybridization of accumulation-tobound dynamics and reinforcement learning, the current study provides evidence for a dual-mechanism account of feedbackdependent learning in inhibitory control.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Finally, additional probe Stop
