Experimental protocol for memory-guided attention.</s><s>(A) In both EEG and fMRI experiments, participants first completed a learning task in which they searched for a target stimulus that was embedded within naturalistic scenes.</s><s>Targets were presented on the right (Right Memory), left (Left Memory) or not at all (Neutral Memory).</s><s>(B) Over repeated sessions, participants found, and learned, the location of target stimuli.</s><s>The learning profile from the EEG experiment is plotted for search accuracy (left y axis, red) and search time (right y axis, blue) as a function of training session number (x axis).</s><s>(C) On the following day, participants performed an attention task in which scenes from the initial learning task were used to cue the location of a subsequent target.</s><s>The first scene was always presented without the target stimulus, whereas the second scene contained a target on 50% of trials.</s><s>On target-present trials, previously learned locations were 100% predictive of the subsequent target location.</s><s>Consequently, valid memory cue scenes could be used to predict the precise location of the subsequent target, whereas memories for neutral cues contained no task-relevant spatial information.</s><s>(D) Behavioral data are shown for the EEG experiment, with sensitivity (left y axis, bars) and RT (right y axis, triangles) plotted as a function memory condition (memory vs. neutral).</s><s>Detection sensitivity was higher for spatially predictive memories, and RTs were shorter.</s><s>Error bars represent ±1 SEM.</s><s>sociated with alpha desynchronization during explicitly cued attention tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr">refs. 11, 26, and 28)</ref>.</s><s>A repeated-measures ANOVA, with factors for electrode side (left vs. right) and cue side (left vs. right) revealed a significant interaction, which reflects contralateral desynchronization (F 1,15 = 3.0, P = 0.039; no main effects, P &gt; 0.1).</s><s>The temporal evolution of contralateral alpha desynchronization is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2B</ref>, which plots the difference in alpha power associated with left and right cues as a function of time and electrode side.</s><s>For the left hemisphere, positive values reflect contralateral desynchronization whereas negative values reflect desynchronization in the right hemisphere.</s><s>This index of differential alpha power shows evidence of contralateral desynchronization after approximately 400 ms.</s></p></div>

0.05 in all other comparisons).</s></p><p><s>As noted earlier, we used long and varied cue-target stimulus onset asynchrony in this fMRI experiment so we could separate activity associated with the memory cue from the neural response to target stimuli.</s><s>As this separation is critical to our  analyses of preparatory activity, we performed subsequent control analyses to confirm that preparatory activity associated with the cue was not contaminated by target-related activity.</s><s>First, we tested for any evidence of lateralized differences in visual activity patterns associated with neutral memory cues for trials within which left or right target stimuli were subsequently presented.</s><s>If target-related activity had contaminated our valid memory cue effects, a similar profile should also be observed even when the cue is not associated with a target-predictive location in memory.</s><s>ROI analyses did not reveal any evidence for spatially specific activation contralateral to the subsequent target location (P &gt; 0.29 for all comparisons, uncorrected for multiple comparisons; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref>).</s><s>More importantly, direct statistical comparison between the preparatory bias associated with the valid memory cue and the equivalent contrast performed on neutral memory cues confirmed that contralateral activity was specific to valid memory cues.</s><s>Analysis of variance, with factors for validity (valid vs. neutral) and ROI (V3v vs. V3a vs. V4) revealed a significant main effect for validity (valid &gt;

0.031), but no other significant terms, suggesting that the pattern of lateralized preparatory activity was not dependent on the presence or absence of the subsequent target stimulus.</s><s>From the results of these control analyses, we can be confident that lateralized activation biases reflect preparatory neural states triggered by spatial predictions stored in LTM.</s></p><p><s>Preparatory Neural Activity: Control Network.</s><s>Similar to the results of the EEG study, the pattern of lateralized changes in preparatory visual activity measured with fMRI strongly resembled changes in pretarget activity observed following an explicit cue that directs the focus of spatial attention (e.g., ref. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>However, instead of an explicit cue directing attention to one or other hemifield, in our study, the cue stimulus does not intrinsically signal any useful spatial information.</s><s>Rather, these cues trigger stored memories for task-relevant spatial locations, which in turn guide attention.</s><s>In this section, we explore the neural substrate for directing preparatory biases from spatial predictions stored in LTM.</s></p><p><s>Previously, Summerfield and colleagues (in 2006; ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>) observed increased activity for frontal and parietal brain areas during experimental trials containing memory-valid cues.</s><s>The network of high-level brain areas closely resembled control areas previously described in the attention literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, suggesting that memory-guided attention could operate through a similar neural mechanism.</s><s>However, because the previous design did not enable dissociation of cue-related and target-related activity, it was not possible to rule out an alternative explanation that activity in the frontoparietal network was elicited by target-related processes, such as stimulus-driven attentional capture, perceptual decisionmaking, and/or response generation.</s><s>As demonstrated in the previous section, the long and variable cue-target stimulus onset asynchrony used in this experiment now allows us to test directly the extent to which activity specific to memory predictions was also specific to memory cues.</s></p><p><s>A whole-brain analysis contrasting the parameter estimates for valid vs. neutral memory cues revealed a network of frontal and parietal brain areas, including intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal eye field (FEF; Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, no significant clusters were identified for the comparison between target events fol-lowing valid or neutral memory cues.</s><s>Next, more detailed analyses were performed on frontal and parietal ROIs based on coordinates for IPS and FEF that were previously reported for memory-guided attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Condition-specific beta parameters estimated for each ROI in each participant were assessed via a repeated-measures ANOVA, with factors for memory validity (valid vs. neutral), event (cue vs. target) and ROI (IPS vs. FEF).</s><s>Main effects were observed for ROI (IPS &gt; FEF: F 1,19 = 26.4,</s><s>P &lt; 0.001) and validity (valid &gt; neutral: F 1,19 = 16.8,</s><s>P = 0.001).</s><s>Most importantly, there was also a validity-by-event interaction (F 1,19 = 15.9,</s><s>P = 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>) caused by significant validity effects associated with cue (P &lt; 0.001), but not with target events (P = 0.87).</s><s>There were no other significant ANOVA terms (P &gt; 0.05).</s><s>These results confirmed that memory-related differences in frontoparietal activity were associated with attentional preparation triggered by the cue, rather than by target-related processes.</s></p><p><s>In the previous study of Summerfield et al. ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), valid-memory trials also elicited more activity in the left hippocampus than neutral-memory trials.</s><s>Although we could not be sure that this differential response was related to cue, and not target-related processing, memory-specific hippocampal activity is consistent with the hypothesis that the hippocampus provides an important interface linking predictions stored in LTM with frontoparietal control mechanisms that can selectively modulate preparatory activity in visual areas according to memory predictions.</s><s>Because the design of the present fMRI experiment separates activity associated with cue and target, we can now confirm that activity in the left hippocampus is triggered by the presentation of the cue scene, rather than during target processing.</s><s>Parameter estimates were extracted from an ROI defined according to the results of the previous and submitted to a two-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA, revealing a main effect for event (cue &gt; target: F 1,19 = 15.1,</s><s>P = 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure">4C</ref>).</s><s>Although there were no other significant terms (P &gt; 0.05), the overall pattern of results clearly resembled the pattern observed for frontoparietal brain areas with a trend for a validity effect associated with cues but not targets.</s></p></div>

from the hippocampus could be integrated within frontoparietal cortex, which in turn generates the appropriate top-down attentional signal to modulate preparatory visual activity.</s></p><p><s>Recent studies highlight the importance of oscillatory dynamics in forming functional connections between distant brain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>, including and prefrontal and visual cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>.</s><s>It will be important for future studies to identify how brain areas for memory, attention, and perception are coupled during memory-guided attention.</s><s>Moreover, further studies could test the critical involvement of frontoparietal cortex in memory-guided orienting by using TMS to disrupt key nodes of the attention network.</s><s>Previously, Summerfield et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> found that memory-guided orienting could facilitate reaction times to memory-predicted targets even with a very short cue period (100 ms).</s><s>Rapid attention effects could reflect direct connections between medial temporal lobe memory structures and visual cortex; whereas modulation via the frontoparietal

perceptual processing according to past experience stored in LTM (see also refs.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>, and that the hippocampus
