1,000 distinct OSN subsets, each defined by the expressed OR gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Multiple additional types of chemosensory neuron have been identified in the mouse MOE, including cells expressing the guanylyl cyclase D receptor (Gucy2d or GC-D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and cells expressing trace-amine associated receptors (TAARs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>These smaller cell populations have been the focus of some recent functional studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , but the full molecular identity and the extent of heterogeneity among the vast majority of chemosensory neuronal cell types in the MOE remain unknown.</s></p><p><s>Here we combine RNA-seq with Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) in a hierarchical fashion: from crude tissue samples containing MOE down to single mature OSNs.</s><s>Our three-step approach is based on purification of mature, GFP-expressing OSNs from whole olfactory mucosa (WOM) scrapes of heterozygous OMP-GFP mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Olfactory marker protein (OMP) is a widely accepted marker for mature OSNs, but some chemosensory neurons in the nasal cavity such as Gucy2d-expressing neurons express little or no OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>We find evidence for expression of 1,087 from 1,099 (98.9%) intact OR genes within these FACS-sorted cell populations, with intact referring to a full length (~1 kb), uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF).</s><s>Importantly, the expression levels in sorted OSNs are proportional to their levels in WOM samples, indicating that our methods of tissue dissociation and FACS reliably retrieve and isolate the many distinct OSN subsets from the MOE component of WOM samples in a highly representative manner.</s><s>We uncover a hitherto unknown bipartition between OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high expressing OSNs, representing a discrete subdivision within the OMP-positive OSN population defined by markers of neuronal maturity.</s><s>By RNA-seq of 21 single OMP-GFP high expressing OSNs, we find that 19 cells express a single intact OR gene abundantly, with some evidence of much lower levels of expression for several other OR genes.</s><s>We demonstrate that the monoallelic expression of an OR gene in a single OSN is extremely tight in the 9 single OSNs for which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) enable discrimination between the two alleles in the mixed 129P2 x C57BL/6 background of the OMP-GFP strain.</s><s>Finally, with the remaining two OMP-GFP high cells, we molecularly characterize a recently described type of chemosensory neuron in the MOE: type B Trpc2 + cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s><s>We demonstrate that these two cells do not express ORs, TAARs, Gucy2d or any of the other known chemosensory G-protein coupled receptors.</s><s>We identify 55 upregulated genes that establish these cells as a novel neuronal type within the MOE, which is fundamentally distinct from canonical OSNs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The transcriptional profile of mature olfactory sensory neurons.</s><s>To characterize gene expression in mature OSNs, we need to purify them away from the many other cell types that are present within the crude tissue samples that can be scraped from the nasal cavity and contain not only pure MOE but also submucosa and adjacent tissues.</s></p><p><s>We FACS-sorted cell suspensions of dissociated WOM samples from 25-day old, heterozygous gene-targeted mice engineered to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the endogenous Olfactory Marker Protein (OMP) promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s><s>We applied RNA-seq to three independent pools of ~10 million OMP-GFP + OSNs (hereafter referred to as "OSNs"), which is approximately the number of OSNs present in the nose of a single adult mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , and to three WOM samples from mice of the same age, strain, and mixed genetic background (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>We find that gene expression levels are highly correlated between independent biological replicates of WOM (Spearman's rho = 0.975) and between OSN pools (Spearman's rho = 0.969) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>A differential expression (DE) analysis identified 790 genes that are expressed higher in OSNs relative to WOM (fold-change &gt; 3; FDR &lt; 5%) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), 50.1% of which are OR or TAAR genes (Supplementary Data S1).</s><s>A gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that genes more highly expressed in the OSN pools relative to WOM are significantly enriched in terms related to the olfactory transduction pathway, as well as in G-protein coupled amine receptor activity (Supplementary Data S1).</s><s>Other enriched GO terms include genes related to synaptic vesicles, branching morphogenesis of a nerve, and peptide hormone processing.</s><s>Of the 5,227 genes that are expressed higher in WOM (fold-change &lt; 0.33; FDR &lt; 5%), 55.46% are expressed at least ten times higher than in the OSN pools, suggesting these are likely to be restricted to entirely different cell types within the WOM samples.</s><s>To validate these observations, we interrogated an existing microarray dataset of OSN gene expression from the same strain of OMP-GFP mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>We find that genes enriched in our FACS-sorted OSNs are consistent with OMP + enrichment in Sammeta et al., and conversely, that genes enriched in our WOM samples are consistent with OMP -enrichment in the same study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>).</s><s>We surveyed the top 200 DE genes between OSNs versus WOM to identify novel genes likely to be involved in olfaction (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>).</s><s>Among the most abundant genes that are more highly expressed in OSNs are Gnal, Gnb1, Adcy3, and Cnga2, all of which are involved in canonical odorant-mediated signal transduction.</s><s>We identified a number of novel genes of interest because of their high differential expression in OSNs, such as Fstl5 and Cmip (the 8 th and 20 th most abundant DE genes in OSNs respectively, Supplementary Data S1).</s></p><p><s>We next compared OR and TAAR gene expression levels between OSNs and WOM.</s><s>To capture the full abundance levels, we mapped the sequencing data to full-length transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> instead of the much shorter Ensembl transcript models, which typically only capture the coding region (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>).</s><s>We find that OR and TAAR gene expression levels are strongly correlated between the OSN and the WOM samples (Spearman's rho = 0.953) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).</s><s>Indeed only 19 (1.52%) OR genes, all expressed at very low levels in the WOM, lack representation in any of the OSN pools, and 13 of these are annotated as pseudogenes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>On average, OR and TAAR genes, as well as other OSN-specific markers, are expressed 2.56 fold higher in the OSN samples than in the WOM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), consistent with mature OSNs comprising a minority of the cells within the WOM.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we have generated the transcriptome of almost the entire mouse OSN repertoire by RNA-seq, identifying hundreds of genes that are OSN-specific and thousands that are restricted to other cells contained within the WOM.</s><s>Our exhaustive sampling approach maintains excellent proportionality of abundance between the purified OSNs and the WOM.</s><s>There are thus no major differences in recovery of OSN subsets expressing the various OR genes by tissue dissociation and FACS-sorting compared to their in situ representation within the MOE.</s></p><p><s>A bipartition of mature olfactory sensory neurons.</s><s>While performing FACS of OSNs on heterozygous OMP-GFP mice, we noticed two distinct subpopulations based on GFP intensity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s><s>As OMP is widely accepted as a marker of mature OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , these may represent subpopulations of mature neurons at distinct stages of maturation.</s></p><p><s>To investigate this hypothesis, we performed RNA-seq on three pools of 10,000 OSNs sampled from the two subpopulations (termed OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high ), each time from a single heterozygous OMP-GFP mouse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>We find that gene expression levels are highly correlated between biological replicates among the OMP-GFP low pools and among the OMP-GFP high pools (Spearman's rho = 0.89-0.91)</s><s>(Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>).</s><s>One OMP-GFP high sample yielded a substantially lower number of sequencing reads (Supplementary Data S2) so we excluded it from our subsequent analyses.</s><s>Consistent with the FACS distributions, we confirmed ~1.5 higher levels of Omp expression in the OMP-GFP high compared to the OMP-GFP low subpopulations, independently by qRT-PCR and RNA-seq (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next investigated the expression levels of 1,235 genes that have been reported to be differentially enriched in immature (670) or mature (565) OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>We find that the mature OSN-enriched genes are robustly expressed at similar levels in both the OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high subpopulations (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.45) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the mature OSN-specific genes are expressed at significantly higher levels than the immature OSN-specific genes in both populations (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P &lt; 2.2-16 for both OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high ), suggesting that OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high cells both correspond to mature OSNs.</s><s>Further, the expression of genes recently implicated in establishing and maintaining monogenic expression in OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> do not significantly differ between the subpopulations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>).</s><s>Among genes involved in OSN axon guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , only Robo2 has a small but significant decrease in expression in the OMP-GFP high subpopulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Consequently, we carried out an unbiased comparison between the two subpopulations to determine how they differ in their transcriptional profile.</s><s>We identified 537 DE genes (FDR &lt; 5%) of which 420 (78.2%) are more highly expressed in the OMP-GFP low subpopulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Applying GO term analysis to these genes in order to obtain indications about the cellular processes they regulate, we find a statistically significant enrichment for terms related to development, morphogenesis, negative regulation of neuronal differentiation and positive regulation of cell proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>; and Supplementary Data S2).</s></p><p><s>A hallmark of neuronal differentiation/maturation is the exit from the cell cycle, late in the G1 stage, by the neural progenitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>We investigated the cell-cycle phase of the OSNs from each subpopulation.</s><s>We selected 971 genes with a "cell cycle" GO annotation, calibrated their expression against a published dataset of staged ES cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>), and analyzed three test sets (blastomeres, brain, and liver, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C</ref>) to ensure that we can accurately allocate RNA-seq data to different cell cycle stages (see Supplementary Methods).</s><s>Testing the RNA-seq datasets from ~10 million OSNs, OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high cells, we found that all samples are allocated to the G1 phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We have thus uncovered a hitherto unknown bipartition among mature OSNs.</s><s>Both subpopulations are postmitotic, but the OMP-GFP low subpopulation, while mature based on its OMP expression level and expression profile of known marker genes, appears to be somewhat less mature than the OMP-GFP high subpopulation.</s></p><p><s>RNA-seq of single olfactory sensory neurons.</s><s>Having identified and isolated a subpopulation of OSNs that represent the most mature state (OMP-GFP high ), we proceeded to the ultimate objective of this study: characterizing gene expression in single mature OSNs by single-cell RNA-seq.</s></p><p><s>We used a Fluidigm C1 microfluidic system to capture 58 single cells from the OMP-GFP high subpopulation of an individual mouse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The remaining wells in the 96-well capture chip were either empty, contained visible debris and/or more than one cell (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>By applying stringent, hierarchical quality control criteria to the RNA-seq data, we further excluded 37 cells.</s><s>We focused our downstream analysis on the remaining 21 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>.</s><s>See Methods and Supplementary Methods for details of the quality control procedure).</s><s>On average 4.4 million sequence fragments were obtained from a single cell.</s><s>Each fragment provides ~200 bp of cDNA sequence, which we mapped to the mouse reference genome (Supplementary Data S3).</s><s>Based on their expression of cell cycle genes, all 21 cells were allocated to the G1 stage, consistent with mature neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3C</ref>).</s><s>To verify that these 21 cells belong to the OMP-GFP high OSN subpopulation, we compared their individual transcriptomes to the gene expression profiles derived from WOM, the pools of 10 million OSNs and the bulk OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high OSN subpopulations.</s><s>As expected, all 21 cells correlate better with the OSN samples than with the WOM samples (paired t-test, P &lt; 2.2-16), and better with the OMP-GFP high than the OMP-GFP low OSN samples (paired t-test, P &lt; 2.2-16) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>We detect, on average, 4,717 + /-175 (SEM) genes per single cell.</s><s>Collectively, 13,582 different genes are expressed in at least one cell, representing 74.2% of the genes expressed in the OMP-GFP high OSN pools.</s></p><p><s>Next we examined expression of a catalog of genes that are widely accepted to characterize distinct cell types within the MOE and the vomeronasal organ (VNO).</s><s>Satisfyingly, we find that all 21 cells show high expression of genes characteristic of mature OSNs (such as Omp, Gnal, Cnga2, Ano2, and Adcy3), and low or no expression of markers of other MOE cell types (such as Gucy2d and Taar), of immature OSNs (such as Gap43, Ascl1, and Neurog1), and of vomeronasal sensory neurons (such as Vmnr and Fpr genes) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>We assessed the expression of 87 additional marker genes that have been identified from microarray and other large-scale analyses of olfactory and vomeronasal mucosae, but have been less well characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> .</s><s>Again, we observe a strong enrichment for expression of marker genes from mature OSNs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have here applied RNA-seq hierarchically to the main olfactory system of the mouse, starting with WOM (crude tissue samples that can be dissected from the nasal cavity and contain non-olfactory cell types), proceeding to GFP + cell pools that were FACS-sorted from heterozygous OMP-GFP mice (mature OSNs), further to sorted OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high subpopulations, finally arriving at single OMP-GFP high OSNs.</s><s>These samples all originated from heterozygous OMP-GFP gene-targeted mice in a mixed 129P2 × C57BL/6 background <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Our data afford six conclusions.</s></p><p><s>First, we show that 1,087 from 1,099 (98.9%) intact OR genes are expressed in mature OSNs, indicating that essentially every member of the OR gene repertoire is a candidate receptor for odorants based on the minimal criterion of expression in mature OSNs.</s><s>Second, the OR gene expression levels in sorted OSNs are highly correlated to their levels in WOM.</s><s>This proportionality proves that our methods of tissue dissociation and FACS retrieve and isolate these different OR-expressing OSN subsets from the MOE in a reliable and representative manner -a critical experimental requirement that thus far had not been demonstrated.</s><s>Third, we uncover a hitherto unknown bipartition between OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high OSNs.</s><s>We show that these subsets represent a subdivision within the population of mature OSNs, with OMP-GFP low cells being somewhat less mature than OMP-GFP high cells.</s><s>Fourth, we find that 19 of 21 single OMP-GFP high OSNs each express a single intact OR gene abundantly, providing the most direct evidence for the one neuron -one receptor rule to date.</s><s>Interestingly, these 19 cells each coexpress a variety of other OR genes at low levels, but so do non-olfactory cells like T-helper lymphocytes and embryonic stem cells, thereby providing a warning for unvalidated interpretation of low-level coexpression of OR genes in OSNs.</s><s>Fifth, we demonstrate that monoallelic expression of the OR gene that is abundantly expressed in an OSN is extremely tight in the 9 of 19 OSNs where SNPs enable discrimination between the two alleles in the mixed 129P2 × C57BL/6 background of the OMP-GFP strain.</s><s>Sixth, the remaining two single OMP-GFP high OSNs appear to be examples of the recently discovered type B Trpc2 + MOE cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref

neuron within the MOE that is fundamentally distinct from canonical OSNs.</s><s>Our hierarchical strategy has thus proven that it can identify and classify a minor MOE cell type, paving the way for identification of additional MOE cell types in an unbiased, explorative, discovery-based approach.</s></p><p><s>Advances in RNA sequencing technologies have made possible the fast and cost-effective whole transcriptome profiling of organs, tissues, and now single cells.</s><s>We and others have recently applied RNA-seq to the mouse olfactory system, allowing us to generate complete lists of the average expression level for each annotated gene across all cell types that are contained within the crude tissue samples that can be dissected from the nasal cavity <ref type="bibr"

especially sensitive to these issues, due to its vast functional diversity of neurons and supporting cells.</s><s>A growing body of work has addressed cellular diversity by sequencing RNA extracted from pools of neurons that express a shared, single marker <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>More recently, single neurons from specific brain areas have been sampled for RNA-seq,

.</s></p><p><s>OSNs constitute an extreme challange for the molecular subclassification of neurons by RNA-seq.</s><s>Since all mature OSNs are likely to fulfill the same general role in chemoreception and are distinguished only by the molecular identity of the odorants that they detect, it is widely accepted that expression of a single allele of a single intact OR gene is a functional molecular classifier.</s><s>Different subsets of OSN can thus be identified, molecularly compared, and contrasted in the context of the expressed OR gene.</s><s>Two early studies analyzed RNA from nine single OSNs using microarrays and LongSAGE, but no data on OR gene expression were reported most likely due to extensive 3' bias in cDNA amplification <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr"

sampled the entire transcriptome of over 99.4% of the population of canonical OSNs.</s><s>Focusing on the most mature subpopulation (OMP-GFP high ), single-cell RNA-seq analysis allowed us to directly test the widely held paradigms of monogenic and monoallelic OR gene expression, and enabled us to characterize a minor type of MOE neurons that do not express OR genes or other known chemoreceptor genes.</s></p><p><s>Most OR genes remain candidate receptors for odorants because no odorous ligands have been identified.</s><s>Arguably a minimal criterion for a gene that phylogenetically belongs to the OR gene repertoire to serve as a receptor for odorants, is that it must be expressed in an olfactory epithelium such as the MOE.</s><s>This issue has become more relevant in light of increasing evidence of ectopic (non-olfactory) expression of OR genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>We here report evidence for expression of 98.9% of intact OR genes in mature OSNs.</s><s>We obtained no reads in our OSN samples for only six intact OR genes (Olfr247, Olfr331, Olfr456, Olfr663, Olfr1008, Olfr1128) that are nonetheless expressed in our WOM samples, albeit at extremely low levels.</s><s>This minor discrepancy suggests that OSNs that express these OR genes are sparse and/or do not mature to the OMP + stage, possibly because the genes do not encode a functional OR.</s><s>On the other hand, this discrepancy between WOM and OSNs also emphasizes the importance of very deep sampling of cells for the study of the complete OSN population.</s><s>Using conservative

type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , but we observed only very minor differences in the expression of these genes.</s><s>Instead, the set of genes that do distinguish them suggests that their constituent OSNs are at different stages during late neuronal maturation, with OMP-GFP low cells being somewhat less mature than OMP-GFP high cells.</s><s>It appears that OSNs increase Omp RNA levels during late maturation.</s><s>We speculate that a discrete and reasonably rapid event must be occurring during the transition between the OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high subpopulations in adult mice, such as completion of successful and stable innervation of a glomerulus that is appropriate for the expressed OR.</s><s>A recent analysis of OSN maturation in postnatal day 7 mice 51 revealed the temporal sequence of expression Gap43, OR, Adcy3, and Omp, but did not indicate a distinction between OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high .</s><s>Conceivably this distinction cannot be made histologically.</s><s>Picking single OMP + OSNs with a pipette prior to single-cell RNA-seq may also suffer from the inability to distinguish between the OMP-GFP low and OMP-GFP high subpopulations.</s><s>Until proven otherwise, we consider it prudent to select OSNs from the most mature, OMP-GFP high population for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, in order to minimize the likelihood

target="#b53">54</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, we cannot discount the possibility that one or more of the additional OR genes could generate low levels of functional OR protein.</s><s>Moreover we sampled less than 1.6% of the subsets of OSN, and our strict quality control procedure selected against the inclusion of OSNs potentially expressing more than one OR at high levels, because these cannot be distinguished empirically from cross-contamination, even when only one cell is visible in the Fluidigm microfluidic chip <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>New technologies for single-cell transcriptome analysis continue to emerge, enabling tens of thousands of neurons to be analyzed in parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s><s>A comprehensive sampling on this scale will be necessary to fully assess the pervasiveness of the one neuron -one receptor rule in OSNs.</s></p><p><s>By capturing cells from a single mouse on a mixed genetic background, we could use SNP analysis to quantify allele-specific OR gene expression for approximately half of the single OSNs.</s><s>In all cases we find that monoallelic expression is extremely tightly regulated.</s><s>Together, these data provide a novel insight into the extraordinary stringency of transcriptional control of OR expression at single-cell resolution.</s><s>It is likely that allelic choice or silencing in OR genes is the first restrictive event to occur, perhaps even in progenitor cells prior to the development of the olfactory system <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>We find that this process is extremely strongly maintained in mature OSNs (&gt; 99.7%).</s><s>In contrast, the promoter and/or splicing machinery of an active OR allele appears to be under weaker regulatory control, permitting in some cases multiple OR gene transcripts from the same allele often in roughly equal abundances.</s><s>All of the transcript variation we detected is within the untranslated regions (UTRs), most likely resulting in no functional consequence for the OR protein and hence exerting no pressure to ensure a single transcript is produced.</s><s>However variation in UTRs can influence the amount of OR protein produced by altering the stability, localization, or translational efficiency of the transcript <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition to the canonical OSNs, which express OR genes, small subsets of neurons that express other chemoreceptor types have been reported in the mouse MOE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> .</s><s>The subset of mature OSNs that express Gucy2d expresses little or no OMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Our experimental design precludes the discovery of further chemosensory cell types that do not express OMP at all, or at low levels.</s><s>However other minor cell types express OMP and therefore would be expected to be represented in the OSN pools or in the mature, OMP-GFP high subpopulation.</s><s>Full transcriptome analysis of single OSNs revealed two that represent a molecularly distinct type, but are not TAAR-expressing neurons.</s><s>Instead, these appear to be examples of the recently described type B Trpc2 + MOE cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with these recent reports, these two OSNs lack expression of Adcy3 but abundantly express Gucy1b2 and Trpc2.</s><s>Importantly, we identified an additional 53 genes not expressed in the canonical OSNs but expressed in both type B cells, and validated three as markers of these cells by ISH.</s><s>It remains puzzling that two out of 21 single captured OSNs (~10%) represent a minor population of OMP + cells in the MOE: a 3-week old mouse has only 16,115 of these type B Trpc2 + MOE cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , which is a mere 0.24% of the estimated ~6.6 million OR-expressing OSNs at the same age <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</s><s>We speculate that the superficial location of type B Trpc2 + MOE cells within the sustentacular layer may facilitate dissociation of these cells.</s><s>Alternatively, these cells may have a different shape or size compared to canonical OSNs, more amenable to capture by the microfluidic device.</s><s>Are these neurons chemosensory?</s><s>Interestingly, they do not express an OR gene abundantly, nor any other previously described chemoreceptor.</s><s>However, they express many of the genes involved in olfactory signal transduction and project axons to form glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Further work will be necessary to determine whether, analagous to the role of Gucy2d in another minor type of OSN <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> , Gucy1b2 itself serves a chemosensory function in these cells.</s></p></div>
