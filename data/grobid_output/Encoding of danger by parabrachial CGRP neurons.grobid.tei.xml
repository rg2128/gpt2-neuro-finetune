<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding of painful stimuli by CGRP PBN neurons</head><p><s>We injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing Cre-dependent GCaMP6m into the lateral PBN of transgenic mice with Cre recombinase targeted to the CGRP-encoding gene (Calca Cre/+ ), thereby introducing a calcium-sensitive fluorophore specifically into CGRP PBN neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1a</ref>).</s><s>This strategy allowed us to record calcium dynamics from individual neurons in mice implanted with a graded-index lens (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>).</s><s>Tail pinch transiently increased calcium activity in CGRP PBN neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1d</ref> and Supplementary Video 1); all 384 neurons responded to at least four out of five tail pinches during a single recording session.</s><s>Most neurons exhibited increased calcium activity following a pinch to the tail or any of the four paws (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether CGRP PBN neurons are activated by noxious stimuli on the face, we placed a warm metal rod on the lip, which activated the same neurons that responded to tail pinch (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>Intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which mimics bacterial infection and causes visceral malaise, also activated pinch-responsive neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1g</ref>, h and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1c</ref>).</s><s>Thus, individual CGRP PBN neurons are activated by noxious stimuli applied to all body parts examined, consistent with studies examining electrical activity from unidentified PBN neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To determine whether CGRP PBN neurons code for the intensity of noxious stimuli, we placed the tail of unconscious mice into a temperature-controlled water bath.</s><s>Neurons were unresponsive to temperatures below 44°C, but most neurons were activated at 46°C and above (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1i</ref>).</s><s>CGRP PBN neurons exhibited more calcium activity with increasing temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1j</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a-e</ref>), similar to studies examining unidentified PBN neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Likewise, CGRP PBN neurons had more calcium activity in response to increasing intensities of electrical shock delivered to the tail (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2f</ref>).</s><s>In awake mice, neurons also exhibited more activity in response to increasing temperatures during a hot-plate test (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>), although they were able to mitigate some of the pain by alternating the paws making contact with the hot plate.</s><s>We conclude that CGRP PBN neurons encode stimulus intensity.</s></p><p><s>In awake and anesthetized mice, electrical shock induced a rapid increase in the calcium activity of most CGRP PBN neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1k</ref>, l and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</s><s>We also measured calcium activity in oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons in the dorsal lateral PBN, a neighboring neuronal population that controls fluid intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Electrical shock did not rapidly affect the activity of those neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1e</ref>).</s><s>The time-locked response of CGRP PBN neurons, but not neighboring PBN neurons, further implicates CGRP PBN neurons as a primary relay for pain signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response to non-painful noxious stimuli</head><p><s>Pain can signal ongoing harm, whereas itch is an adaptive response that may lead to avoidance of harmful plants and insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Although itch-responsive sensory neurons overlap with those that respond to painful stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , little is known about brain circuits contributing to itch-related behaviors.</s><s>We monitored calcium activity in anesthetized mice that received a subcutaneous injection of chloroquine, a drug that causes itching <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Chloroquine injection increased calcium activity in most CGRP PBN neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine whether activation of CGRP PBN neurons is required for chloroquine-induced scratching, we injected an AAV expressing Cre-dependent tetanus toxin light chain (AAV-DIO-GFP:TetTox) bilaterally into the PBN of Calca Cre/+ mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b</ref>).</s><s>TetTox cleaves synaptobrevin, a synaptic-vesicle protein necessary for neurotransmitter release <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> thereby completely preventing neurotransmitter release from Cre-expressing neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Compared to mice injected with GFP-control virus, chloroquine-induced scratching was attenuated in mice with TetTox 'silencing' of CGRP PBN neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>We examined whether activation of CGRP PBN neurons also contributes to scratching induced by a non-chemical stimulus by placing an adhesive sticker on the neck of mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2e</ref>).</s><s>This manipulation activates mechanoreceptors and elicits scratching and paw swipes to remove the sticker, but is not thought to be painful <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ; TetTox silencing of CGRP PBN neurons attenuated stickerremoval attempts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2f</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, CGRP PBN neurons can be activated by non-painful noxious stimuli and their activation is required to elicit appropriate behavioral responses.</s><s>These findings identify a specific population of PBN neurons that contribute to itch-related behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CGRP neuron activity during feeding</head><p><s>Because CGRP PBN neurons contribute to satiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , we examined whether they are modulated by feeding-related stimuli in mice that were food-deprived overnight and then given access to their familiar chow pellet.</s><s>Calcium activity of CGRP PBN neurons was rapidly inhibited when food was presented (Supplementary Video 2), even before taking the first bite (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a</ref>, b and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3a</ref>).</s><s>We also observed rapid decreases in calcium activity before bites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3b</ref>).</s><s>The homogeneity of inhibitory responses was notable (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>To ensure that these effects were not due movement artifacts, we analyzed fluorescence in regions of interest lacking neurons and observed no changes before or during feeding (data not shown).</s><s>We also analyzed calcium recordings using constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Individual traces extracted from CNMF analysis show that calcium transients are not synchronized, but all neurons are similarly inhibited upon presentation of food and before bites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3d</ref>, e and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</s><s>Since activation of CGRP PBN neurons suppresses appetite 3 , their inhibition should support feeding.</s></p><p><s>We also examined calcium activity as feeding progressed.</s><s>Food deprivation lowered the activity of CGRP PBN neurons relative to the sated state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3f</ref>), consistent with increased inhibitory input from AgRP neurons, which are activated during food deprivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , and/or decreased excitatory input from anorexigenic neurons in the NTS 4,5 .</s><s>After 30 min of feeding, neurons became more active (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3f</ref>), which corresponded to a decrease in food intake compared to the first 30 min (0-30 min, 0.71 ± 0.04 g, 30-60 min, 0.22 ± 0.02 g; mean ± SEM).</s><s>In general, these neurons became more active as feeding progressed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3g</ref>), with the majority of neurons exhibiting more calcium activity relative to either nonfasted or fasted baseline conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3h</ref>).</s><s>All neurons that were analyzed in the feeding study also responded to tail pinch (data not shown).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding of food neophobia</head><p><s>Given that CGRP PBN neurons respond to anticipatory signals before food consumption, we asked whether they respond to other complex sensory inputs by examining the neophobia response to a novel food, an adaptive trait that limits consumption of unfamiliar, potentially toxic foods.</s><s>In contrast to their response to the familiar diet, we observed increased calcium activity when mice were presented with a novel, high-fat food pellet (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4a</ref>f and Supplementary Video 3).</s><s>CGRP PBN neurons were also activated following each bite during the first trial (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4g</ref>).</s><s>However, after acclimation, CGRP PBN neurons became inhibited before and during consumption of the palatable diet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4h,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>), similar to consumption of their normal diet.</s><s>The change in the pattern of calcium activity corresponded with a decreased latency to begin consumption during the last trial (20.4 ± 4.1 s; mean ± SEM) compared to the first trial (115.2 ± 16.0 s; mean ± SEM).</s><s>We also monitored calcium activity in response to an inedible novel object (marble).</s><s>Neurons were activated upon first presentation (Supplementary Video 4), a response that dissipated as mice became acclimated to the object (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>).</s><s>After acclimation, neuronal activity did not decline as with the palatable diet, likely because food is appetitive whereas the marble becomes neutral after acclimation.</s></p><p><s>We examined the necessity of CGRP PBN neurons for behavioral expression of food neophobia by silencing them with TetTox (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4d</ref>).</s><s>Compared to control mice, TetToxinjected mice exhibited an attenuated food neophobia response, which was apparent during the first two exposures to a novel palatable diet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4e</ref>), indicating that CGRP PBN neurons contribute to food neophobia.</s><s>This result is consistent with attenuation of food neophobia caused by lesions of the lateral PBN <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reactivation of CGRP PBN neurons by fear memory</head><p><s>With food neophobia, fear behavior dissipates after repeated exposures, suggesting that a positive memory was formed and that CGRP PBN neurons are sensitive to learning processes.</s><s>We postulated that CGRP PBN neurons might also respond to a negative memory, such that exposure to a stimulus paired with a painful event would lead to activation of CGRP PBN neurons by that conditioned stimulus.</s></p><p><s>Mice were subjected to footshock/tone conditioning, an experimental paradigm in which mice learn to associate a neutral stimulus (tone) with an electrical footshock (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a</ref>).</s><s>These mice formed a fear memory, made evident by the fact that the tone alone was sufficient to elicit 'freezing' (rodent fear response) the next day (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5b</ref>).</s><s>After conditioning, CGRP PBN neurons were activated during the 10-s tone presentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6a</ref>).</s><s>Neuronal activation became less robust during extinction with repeated presentations of the tone in the absence of footshock (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5d</ref>, e and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6a</ref>), which corresponded with a decrease in freezing behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5b</ref>).</s><s>Mice that did not receive footshocks with the tone during conditioning did not exhibit tone-induced freezing or increased calcium activity in CGRP PBN neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5f-j</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6b</ref>).</s><s>We also examined whether non-specific contextual cues can activate CGRP PBN neurons in mice that underwent footshock fear conditioning (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6c</ref>).</s><s>Compared to test trials before conditioning, placing mice in the shock chamber after conditioning was sufficient to increase calcium activity in CGRP PBN neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6d-g</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, in addition to being a primary relay of pain signals necessary and sufficient to form a fear memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , CGRP PBN neurons also become activated during recall of that aversive memory.</s></p><p><s>To examine whether activation of CGRP PBN neurons contributes to learned behavioral fear responses, mice underwent footshock fear conditioning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6a</ref>) followed by CGRP PBN neuron silencing with TetTox after the fear memory had been formed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6b</ref>).</s><s>We used greater shock intensities than in the previous experiment to form a more robust fear memory because extinction training occurred weeks after conditioning to allow sufficient time for TetTox expression.</s><s>Compared to GFP control, mice with TetTox silencing of CGRP PBN neurons rapidly extinguished their freezing response during repeated presentations of the tone without footshocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6c</ref>).</s><s>By the second fear-extinction training session, fearconditioned TetTox mice exhibited minimal freezing behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6d</ref>), similar to control mice that did not undergo fear conditioning (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6e-h</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, fear-conditioned GFPcontrol mice continued to freeze in response to the tone during the second extinction training session (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, activation of CGRP PBN neurons significantly contributes to fear responses during recall of an aversive memory.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Here we show that CGRP PBN neurons become activated in response to danger signals of diverse sensory modalities -visceral and cutaneous pain (chemical, mechanical, thermal, electrical), itch, and meal-related satiety signals -that involve various ascending sensory pathways (trigeminal, spinal, vagal).</s><s>CGRP PBN neurons are also activated by danger signals that require cognition as shown by the food-neophobia and fear-conditioning assays, and TetTox loss-of-function studies reveal that these neurons contribute to both innate and learned fear behaviors.</s><s>Thus, CGRP PBN neurons convey negative valence, while parallel pathways likely provide information regarding sensory modality and stimulus origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> to help elicit appropriate responses.</s><s>In addition to modalities examined here, we hypothesize that CGRP PBN neurons respond to gustatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , olfactory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , auditory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , vestibular <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , and other visceral stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Calcium recordings show that CGRP PBN neurons as a population are activated or inhibited in response to (putative) salient stimuli.</s><s>This arrangement is observed in AgRP 'hunger' neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and in that case separate projections to distinct brain regions contribute to various aspects of hunger-related behaviors and physiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> .</s><s>CGRP PBN neurons project to the CeA and BNST <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , nuclei that mediate behavioral and physiological responses to ingestive and fear-related stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Downstream CeA neurons express the CGRP receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , and a subpopulation of those neurons co-express protein kinase C-δ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , but the identity of downstream BNST neurons is unknown.</s><s>We postulate that the CeA and BNST contribute to different aspects of behavior and/or alter behaviors over different timescales.</s><s>Behaviors may also be tuned by the magnitude and duration of CGRP PBN neuronal activation, which could lead to differential activation of postsynaptic targets.</s></p><p><s>Although we focused on aversive stimuli, pain-responsive CGRP PBN neurons also respond to feeding-related stimuli.</s><s>CGRP PBN neurons are rapidly inhibited before food consumption, indicating that there is bidirectional control of their activity and revealing that they also participate in a normal, non-aversive behavior.</s><s>Inhibition from AgRP neurons or decreased input from anorexigenic neurons in the NTS 5 likely dampens CGRP PBN neuron activity during fasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , but the decreases in calcium activity during food consumption are unlikely to come from AgRP neurons because they are inactive during feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Because CGRP PBN neurons transmit potential danger signals, their inhibition during starvation might contribute to adaptive behaviors, such as increased risk taking to acquire food <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , in addition to permitting increased food intake.</s></p><p><s>Numerous forebrain projections to the PBN have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> that are candidates for control of CGRP PBN neurons in response sensory signals requiring complex processing during neophobia and learning.</s><s>Interestingly, we observed similar behavioral responses between fear-conditioned mice with either intact or inhibited CGRP PBN neurons during the first tone trial of extinction training, but the TetTox-treated mice extinguished their fear memory faster.</s><s>This result suggests that activation of other brain areas is initially sufficient to elicit a learned fear response, but CGRP PBN neuronal activation is critical for maintaining a persistent fear state and retarding extinction.</s><s>Current fear-extinction hypotheses suggest that extinction of a fear memory involves weakening of the original associative memory and/or consolidation of a newly acquired "safe" memory that overrides the original fear memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Our findings are congruent with either interpretation, since activation of CGRP PBN neurons could strengthen the original fear memory or preclude formation of a "safe" memory.</s></p><p><s>We expect that future studies will reveal how CGRP PBN neurons are rapidly controlled by various neuronal inputs and shed light on how core brainstem circuits are recruited to produce complex behaviors.</s><s>These endeavors may ultimately lead to a better understanding of how CGRP PBN neurons alter affective-motivational behaviors associated with transient <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and chronic threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , and mental disorders that might involve dysregulation of upstream
