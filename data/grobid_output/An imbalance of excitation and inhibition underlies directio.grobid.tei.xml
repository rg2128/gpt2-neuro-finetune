<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>inhibitory neurons make long-range, intercolumnar projections to excitatory neurons that prefer the opposite direction of motion.</s><s>We conclude that intracortical inhibition exerts a major influence on the degree of direction selectivity in layer 2/3 of ferret V1 by suppressing responses to the null direction of motion.</s></p><p><s>Using sparse expression of GCaMP6s and two-photon calcium imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , we first determined a neuron's somatic preferred direction using drifting grating stimuli (example cell, Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) and then presented the somatic preferred and null directions while imaging spines on apical and basal dendrites.</s><s>Individual dendritic branches contained spines that responded preferentially to either the somatic preferred or null directions (example branch, Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>); this diversity existed throughout the dendritic field of single neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>).</s><s>By quantifying spine responses using a direction selectivity index (DSI, see methods) we found that spines tuned for the somatic preferred and null directions exhibited somewhat different DSI values (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, Wilcoxon rank-sum, P = .002,</s><s>n = 384 preferred spines, n = 233 null spines from n = 17 cells from 10 animals), and in 8/12 direction-selective cells (soma DSI&gt;0.3),</s><s>we observed more spines tuned to the somatic preferred direction than to the null (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>).</s><s>Similar fractions of spines from basal (300/498) and apical (84/119) dendrites responded more strongly to the somatic preferred direction (60.2% and 70.6%, respectively).</s><s>We then computed bootstrapped sums of normalized spine responses (see Methods) to assess the relation between the DSI of a neuron's inputs and soma.</s><s>Summed excitatory synaptic input was weakly tuned (summed spine DSI .1 ± .1, median ± IQR, n = 17 cells) and we found no correlation between summed spine and somatic DSI across our sample (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>, r = -.08,</s><s>P = .75,</s><s>n = 17 cells), regardless of how we assessed synaptic input direction selectivity (see Methods, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">1a-b</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these data emphasize that functional specificity of excitatory synaptic inputs converging onto individual layer 2/3 neurons is sufficient to account for somatic direction preference, but fails to explain the degree of somatic direction selectivity.</s></p><p><s>Previous work suggests that spike threshold amplifies weak biases in excitatory synaptic inputs to enhance spiking direction selectivity of neurons in layer 4 of cat V1 14 .</s><s>To examine whether subthreshold membrane potential (V m ) responses reflect the weak biases in excitatory inputs demonstrated by our spine imaging, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from layer 2/3 neurons using a K + -based internal solution (n = 76 cells from 23 animals, example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-b</ref>).</s><s>A majority of cells (78%, n = 54/69) showed strong spiking direction selectivity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, nearly half of the cells with direction-selective spiking responses (48%, n = 26/54) showed strong direction tuning in their V m (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), and the degree of V m selectivity was correlated with spiking selectivity (n = 69 cells, r = .56,</s><s>P = 5.67e-7).</s><s>The strong direction selectivity evident in V m responses is in sharp contrast to the weak selectivity predicted by the distribution of excitatory synaptic inputs and forced us to consider factors that might contribute to the strong direction tuning of V m responses.</s><s>In principle, the emergence of strong subthreshold tuning from broadly tuned excitatory inputs could reflect mechanisms that enhance the effectiveness of excitatory inputs tuned to the preferred direction, diminish the effectiveness of excitatory inputs tuned to the null direction, or some combination of these factors.</s><s>To distinguish among these alternatives, we asked if there was a consistent relationship between subthreshold selectivity and subthreshold response amplitude to preferred and null direction stimuli.</s><s>We found no correlation between V m DSI and subthreshold response amplitude to the preferred direction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, r = -.001,</s><s>P = .99,</s><s>n = 76).</s><s>In contrast, we found a strong anticorrelation between V m DSI and null direction response amplitude (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>, r = -.69,</s><s>P = 5.07e-12, n = 76).</s></p><p><s>These results point to factors impacting null direction responses as being important in determining V m selectivity.</s></p><p><s>We then considered the degree to which inhibitory inputs contribute to subthreshold responses to the null direction of motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Theoretical models predict that when levels of inhibition are high relative to excitation, not only is there a reduction in the level of depolarization, but also a reduction in the 'noise' or V m variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>We therefore examined the relationship between subthreshold DSI and V m noise (see Methods) for the preferred direction and observed no significant correlation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>, r = -.10,</s><s>P = .39,</s><s>n = 76 cells).</s><s>Instead, we uncovered a strong anticorrelation between subthreshold DSI and V m noise at the null direction (example, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>, r = -.61,</s><s>P = 6.94e-9, n = 76 cells), consistent with a significant role for inhibition to the null direction in shaping subthreshold direction selectivity of layer 2/3 neurons.</s></p><p><s>The idea that inhibition contributes to direction selectivity stands in contrast to a number of studies showing that inhibition functions to normalize cortical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>These studies show that excitation and inhibition are generally co-tuned <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> while our observations suggest that the tuning of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto direction-selective neurons are dissimilar.</s><s>To directly measure excitatory (G e ) and inhibitory (G i ) synaptic conductances underlying direction selectivity, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings using a Cs + -based internal solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and recorded V m responses to drifting gratings at different current steps to extract synaptic conductances and their direction tuning (example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-b</ref>, see Methods).</s><s>We observed a wide range of direction selectivity present in synaptic conductances and found that excitatory and inhibitory DSI were not correlated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>, r = .</s><s>043, P = .91,</s><s>n = 10 cells from 7 animals) and therefore not co-tuned.</s><s>In half of our recorded neurons, excitation and inhibition preferred opposite directions (Δθ &gt; 135 o ) and across the population there was a significant bias toward preferring opposite directions (Extended Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>Despite a lack of co-tuning, excitation and inhibition shared similar tuning bandwidth (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Understanding the impact of inhibitory conductances on subthreshold responses requires considering co-occurring excitatory conductances.</s><s>Thus, we measured the relative strength of inhibition as the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory conductance (G i /G e ) and found that G i /G e was systematically larger for null direction than for preferred direction stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>, WSR, P = .037,</s><s>n = 10).</s><s>Moreover, the direction selectivity of predicted V m from empirically measured synaptic conductances (population tuning curves in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> was significantly correlated with the G i /G e ratio at the null direction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>, r=.</s><s>81, P = .008,</s><s>n = 10 cells from 7 animals) but not the preferred direction (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with our spine imaging data (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>), predicted V m direction selectivity was not correlated with the direction tuning of excitation alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>, r = .49,</s><s>P = .15,</s><s>n = 10).</s><s>Our measurements of synaptic conductances suggest that relatively stronger inhibitory input at the null direction acts to enhance somatic direction selectivity.</s></p><p><s>If relatively greater G i /G e at the null direction contributes to direction selectivity in layer 2/3, inactivating GABAergic neurons in layer 2/3 would reduce suppression at the null-direction and reduce selectivity, as suggested by previous pharmacological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically suppressed layer 2/3 GABAergic neurons by expressing GtACR2 under control of the mDlx enhancer and measured direction selectivity using whole-cell patch clamp recordings with K + -based internal solution.</s><s>Optogenetic inactivation of GABAergic neurons (example, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) increased evoked response amplitude (example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>) and reduced V m DSI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h</ref>, P = .004,</s><s>WSR, n = 16 cells from 4 animals) and spiking DSI (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, changes in subthreshold direction selectivity were not related to the absolute V m depolarization induced by GABAergic photoinhibition in individual neurons (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).</s><s>Instead, the degree to which null-direction responses were modulated by GABAergic suppression (see Methods) depended on the cell's V m DSI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref>, r = .56,</s><s>P = .025,</s><s>n = 16 cells), while no such relationship was observed for modulation of preferred-direction responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3i</ref>, r =. 20, P = .46,</s><s>n = 16 cells).</s><s>Based on these results, inhibition enhances subthreshold direction selectivity through null-direction suppression and we would predict that GABAergic neurons preferring the opposite direction would contribute to this suppression.</s></p><p><s>GABAergic neurons in ferret V1 are direction-tuned and form direction columns <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> aligned with the underlying intrinsic signal direction preference map (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8a-b</ref>).</s><s>For GABAergic neurons to innervate oppositely tuned excitatory cells, their projections must extend beyond the local direction domain and into adjacent cortical columns.</s><s>This would be inconsistent with studies from mouse V1 where excitatory neurons receive inhibitory input from local (within 100-200 μm) GABAergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> .</s><s>However, in carnivore V1, it has been shown that GABAergic neurons make axonal projections spanning longer distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>To test whether GABAergic neurons project beyond their local cortical column, we labeled axon projections with punctate injections of AAV2/1.mDlx.GCaMP6s and characterized the direction tuning of axon projections at sites distal to the injection location (example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a-d</ref>).</s><s>A substantial fraction (60.5%) of long-range projecting individual boutons exhibited direction-selective responses (example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>, population median .39</s><s>±.46 IQR, n = 815 boutons, 8 fields of view from 2 animals) and diverse direction preferences when compared to the intrinsic signal map (example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>We found a surprising abundance of direction-selective GABAergic boutons tuned to the opposite direction of direction domains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>).</s><s>Further, individual bouton preferences were significantly different from the map (Monte Carlo significance test, P &lt;.001, n = 493 boutons), providing an anatomical substrate for synaptic inhibition observed in our previous measurements.</s></p><p><s>To examine whether individual neurons receive inhibitory synaptic input from distant GABAergic neurons, we developed a technique called Somatically Targeted Optogenetic Membrane Potential Mapping (STOMPM) to directly map the spatial connectivity of inhibitory onto excitatory neurons in vivo.</s><s>We localized Channelrhodopsin-2 to the soma and proximal dendrites of GABAergic neurons using a Kv2.1 targeting motif (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>) to prevent stimulation of neuropil and enhance our functional resolution.</s><s>As GABAergic neuron direction preferences are smoothly mapped in a columnar fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>), we used patterned photostimulation driven by a DLP projector <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> to activate GABAergic neurons in local cortical regions (~100-200 μm, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>) while recording from single neurons to measure inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) (example cell, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Optical stimulation evoked robust IPSPs (examples, Fig 4h) even at spots distant from recorded cells.</s><s>Neurons received inhibitory synaptic input from long distances (example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4i</ref>); inhibitory input fields often exceeded 1mm along their major axis (example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4i-j</ref>, summary data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4k</ref>, major axis length 930 ± 278μm, median ± IQR, n = 21 cells from 7 animals) and many inputs arrived from distances greater than 500 μm (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>), and we recognize that these measures likely underestimate the total extent of input field size (see Methods).</s><s>Finally, we aligned our stimulation grid with the intrinsic signal direction preference map (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4l</ref>) to characterize the functional origin of evoked IPSPs.</s><s>Indeed, we found that neurons with direction-selective V m (n =7 cells, mean tuning curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4m</ref>) received almost equivalent inhibitory synaptic input from nulltuned direction domains as preferred-tuned (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4n</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Previous studies suggest inhibition and excitation are generally co-tuned <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4o</ref>) as shown for orientation selectivity in mouse V1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and layer 4 simple cells of cat V1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , albeit with distinct temporal dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , acting to scale or gate overall responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, we find that cortical inhibition can suppress responses to specific stimuli through differential tuning with excitation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4o</ref>).</s><s>Such differential tuning can arise through multiple combinations of excitation and inhibition, such that null-direction suppression is driven by either null-biased or equivalent inhibitory inputs for both directions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4o</ref>).</s><s>Differential tuning can enhance subthreshold selectivity, which is further augmented through spike threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4o</ref>).</s><s>Our findings are conceptually similar to those in retinal ganglion cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , but differ in exact circuit implementation as ganglion cell direction selectivity arises through inhibitory input mediated by starburst amacrine cells.</s><s>One factor we did not consider is the temporal interplay between excitation and inhibition, which could play an important contributing role in enhancing selectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Taken together with previous studies, the selective responses of cortical neurons are built with a broadly tuned palette of excitatory synaptic inputs that is further refined by enhancing responses to the preferred stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and suppressing responses to non-preferred stimuli.</s></p></div>
