largely unaffected in kdrl/kdr morphants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) (see Materials and Methods for quantification specifics).</s><s>The venous sprouts still formed a primitive plexus in kdrl/kdr morphants, and only displayed marginal defects in branching (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1c</ref>).</s><s>This vascular network was unstable and ultimately regressed, as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>While our data corroborate the role of Vegf-A signaling in regulating ISA formation and endothelial cell stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , they suggest that another angiogenic stimulus regulates sprouting from the AV.</s></p><p><s>To identify the angiogenic signal required for sprouting from the AV, we analyzed the expression of components from several signaling pathways (data not shown), and found that Bone Morphogenetic Protein (Bmp) pathway components were selectively expressed in the developing CVP.</s><s>Whole mount in situ hybridization indicated that the bmp2b ligand was highly expressed within the CVP and surrounding tissue during plexus formation (26-32 hours post-fertilization (hpf)), and expression subsided as the CVP stabilized at 38hpf (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1d</ref>).</s><s>In addition, two Bmp type II receptors, bmpr2a and bmpr2b, were strongly expressed in the endothelial cells of the CVP at 26, 32,

phosphorylate Bmp Type I receptors, which in turn activate Smad and/or MAP kinase signaling 8 .</s><s>To test whether Bmp signaling regulates sprouting of the AV, we manipulated expression of Bmp pathway components in the developing zebrafish using a heat shock promoter (hsp70l) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>To determine the expression profile of hsp70l, we heatshocked Tg(hsp70l:GFP) embryos at 25hpf and found that GFP was expressed in most tissues and cell types (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2a</ref>).</s><s>We next analyzed the effects of decreased Bmp activity on sprouting from the AV by over-expressing noggin3, an endogenous inhibitor of Bmp signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Control embryos heat-shocked at the onset of plexus formation (25hpf) showed no apparent vascular abnormalities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Movie S1).</s><s>In contrast, heatshocked Tg(hsp70l:noggin3) embryos displayed CVP with aberrant sprouts that failed to make proper connections with neighboring sprouts, but showed no ISA defects (arrows, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3a</ref>, and Suppl.</s><s>Movie S2).</s><s>Similar results were also observed in Tg(hsp70l:dnbmprI-GFP) embryos that expressed a dominant negative Bmp receptor type I GFP fusion (DNBmprI-GFP) when heat-shocked (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2b</ref>).</s><s>Since CVP patterning was perturbed

signaling could induce angiogenesis.</s><s>bmp2b expression was increased in heat-shock treated Tg(hsp70l:bmp2b) embryos at the onset of CVP formation.</s><s>bmp2b over-expression induced ectopic sprouts along the AV, with the most robust ectopic sprouting occurring in the CVP (arrowheads, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3b</ref>, and Suppl.</s><s>Movie S3).</s><s>Bmp-induced ectopic sprouts extended from the AV and migrated between the epithelial surface and the somite boundary, forming an additional plexus in a region that is avascular in wild-type (WT) embryos (arrowheads, Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4a</ref>).</s><s>The Bmp-induced plexus highly expressed a venous marker, dab2, indicating that it has venous identity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4b</ref>).</s><s>Although Bmp over-expression induced robust sprouting from the AV, ectopic sprouts were never observed from the DA (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>To further delineate the specificity of Bmp signaling, WT and Tg(hsp70l:bmp2b) embryos were heat-shocked at 2.5dpf, when ventral sprouts from the AV form the subintestinal vein plexus (SIVP) (arrows, Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4c</ref>).</s><s>The SIVP in bmp2b over-expressing embryos was shifted dorsally (arrows, Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4c</ref>) and contained ectopic vessels (arrowhead, Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4c</ref>), suggesting that the SIVP is also responsive to Bmp signaling.</s><s>These data indicate that sprouting angiogenesis from the AV during early development is uniquely dependent on Bmp signaling.</s></p><p><s>To assess the cellular effects of Bmp signaling on venous endothelial cell behavior, we performed time-lapse imaging.</s><s>WT embryos formed a honeycomb-like plexus by 32hpf, and this plexus began to retract filopodia and stabilize by 35hpf (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Movie S1).</s><s>However, Tg(hsp70l:noggin3) embryos contained atypical angiogenic sprouts that failed to make connections and never formed a proper plexus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Movie.</s><s>S2).</s><s>In contrast, Tg(hsp70l:bmp2b) embryos contained ectopic endothelial sprouts.</s><s>These ectopic sprouts branched and sprouted from the dorsal vein of the CVP as early as 6.5 hours after heat-shock treatment (32hpf) and rapidly migrated dorsally (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Movie S3).</s></p><p><s>To better characterize the noggin3 and bmp2b over-expression phenotypes, we counted venous endothelial cell nuclei and performed branch point analyses in WT, noggin3, and bmp2b over-expressing embryos.</s><s>While the number of venous endothelial cells in the CVP remained relatively unchanged in noggin3 over-expressing embryos, we observed a slight but significant increase in endothelial cell numbers in bmp2b over-expressing embryos (Supp Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3c</ref>).</s><s>Venous branch points, however, were significantly altered in both noggin3 and bmp2b over-expressing embryos (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3d</ref>).</s><s>We found that the number of branch points was decreased more than 7 fold by noggin3 over-expression, and increased approximately 2.5 fold by bmp2b over-expression (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3d</ref>).</s><s>In addition, bmp2b over-expression caused a significant increase in the number of filopodia (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4d-e</ref>), and randomized their direction of extension (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4f</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, our data indicate that Bmp is a pro-angiogenic cue that regulates angiogenesis in the AV.</s></p><p><s>To investigate whether the Bmp type II receptors expressed in the developing CVP regulate Bmp-mediated angiogenesis, we analyzed bmpr2a or bmpr2b morphants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-d</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref>).</s><s>While the number of arterial sprouts did not differ significantly from control embryos, sprouts from the AV were significantly reduced in bmpr2a and bmpr2b morphants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-b</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5c</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, knock-down of bmpr2a or bmpr2b in bmp2b over-expressing embryos inhibited formation of ectopic sprouts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c-d</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5d</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, Bmpr2a and Bmpr2b regulate Bmp-mediated angiogenesis from the AV.</s></p><p><s>Considering the expression and function of bmpr2a and bmpr2b in CVP formation, it is likely that Bmp activation is required in endothelial cells.</s><s>To investigate this hypothesis, we generated mosaic embryos by injecting either kdrl:GFP or kdrl:DNBmprI-GFP in the Tg(kdrl:mCherry) background.</s><s>The resulting embryos contained patches of endothelial cells that strongly expressed GFP or DNBmprI-GFP.</s><s>The GFP-expressing control cells extended venous sprouts, which made connections and formed a honeycomb-like plexus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Movie S4).</s><s>In contrast, the DNBmprI-GFP-expressing cells were unable to extend sprouts from the AV, and they failed to connect with neighboring endothelial cells to form a honeycomb-like plexus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref> and Suppl.</s><s>Movie S5).</s></p><p><s>The segments that contained DNBmprI-GFP-expressing cells had fewer branch points than GFP expressing control cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g</ref>), indicating that Bmp signaling within endothelial cells is important during branching morphogenesis.</s><s>In addition, the frequency with which the branches connected to form a plexus was significantly reduced in DNBmprI-GFPexpressing cells, suggesting that Bmp signaling within endothelial cells is critical for the formation of endothelial networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3h</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, our results indicate that Bmpmediated angiogenesis requires Bmp activation in endothelial cells.</s></p><p><s>Bmp signaling activates the Smad signaling cascade and/or alternative MAP kinase signaling cascades such as Erk and p38 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>To delineate the downstream factors critical for Bmp-mediated angiogenesis, we first analyzed the activity/phosphorylation status of Smad1/5/8 (R-Smads) and Erk.</s><s>Activated R-Smads and Erk were present within the ectopic sprouts from the AV (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S6a-b</ref>).</s><s>To assess the function of R-Smad and Erk signaling in Bmp-mediated angiogenesis, we blocked the activity of R-Smad or Erk by treating embryos with small chemical inhibitors.</s><s>To inhibit the R-Smad signaling cascade, we used DMH1, which inhibits Alk2/3 and selectively abrogates activation of R-Smads without affecting MAP kinase activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>In addition, we inhibited the p38 pathway with SB203580, and the Erk pathway with either U0126 (data not shown) or SL327.</s><s>While both arterial and venous angiogenesis was unaffected by treatment with DMSO or the p38 inhibitor, inhibition of R-Smad activation selectively blocked formation of the CVP without affecting ISAs, and inhibition of Erk activity blocked formation of both the CVP and ISAs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a-b</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, inhibiting R-Smad or Erk activation in Bmp over-expressing embryos efficiently inhibited the percentage of segments with ectopic vessels, while p38 inhibition had no effect on the percent of segments with ectopic vessels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c-d</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the Erk inhibitor also drastically attenuated the length and progression of the ectopic sprouts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, these results suggest that R-Smad activation selectively regulates venous sprouting angiogenesis, and Erk (but not p38) activation is involved in the progression of Bmp-mediated venous sprouts as well as arterial sprouts.</s></p><p><s>Since activation of the Bmp signaling cascade transcriptionally regulates multiple genes and pathways, we analyzed the transcriptional levels of important regulators of angiogenesis using quantitative RT-PCR.</s><s>Transcription levels of Tg(hsp70l:bmp2b) embryos were compared to WT at 2 and 5 hours post heat-shock induction of bmp2b.</s><s>id2a, a downstream transcriptional target of Bmp signaling, was used as a positive control.</s><s>vegfa, vegfc (also a major stimulus of lymphangiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> ), vegfr3/flt4 (a venous marker and receptor for Vegf-C), and dll4 (an arterial marker and tip cell marker <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> ) were also tested.</s><s>Bmp overexpression upregulated id2a by over 3-fold at 2 hours post heat-shock, while vegfa, vegfc, flt4, and dll4 were either marginally affected or not affected at all (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>In addition vegfa, vegfc, flt4, and dll4 transcript levels were unaffected 5 hours post heat-shock induction of bmp2b (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To test the physiological relevance of the moderate increase in vegfa transcription at 2 hours post heat-shock, Bmp over-expression was induced in embryos lacking Vegf receptors.</s><s>Coinjection of the kdrl/kdr MOs resulted in a single AV at 2dpf (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>).</s><s>Despite the severely disrupted vascular network, Bmp-induced ectopic blood vessels were unaffected in kdrl/kdr morphants, demonstrating that Bmp is capable of inducing angiogenesis when Vegf receptors are inhibited (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a-b</ref>).</s><s>We next analyzed the effects of Bmp and Vegf-A small molecule inhibitors during sprouting angiogenesis of the axial vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Addition of dorsomorphin, a chemical inhibitor of both the Bmp and Vegf-A signaling pathways, effectively inhibited vessels from the DA and AV and blocked Bmp-induced ectopic vessels (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>DMH4, an inhibitor of Vegf-A signaling, preferentially blocked vessels from the DA and had no effect on Bmp-induced ectopic vessels, while DMH1, an inhibitor of Bmp signaling, selectively inhibited vessels from the AV and disrupted Bmp-induced ectopic vessels (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Bmp is the major stimulus for sprouting angiogenesis from the AV, and that Vegf-A is the major stimulus for sprouting from the DA.</s><s>Secondly, these results suggest that Bmp mediates angiogenesis independent of a significant contribution from Vegf-A signaling.</s></p><p><s>To compare the angiogenic effects of Bmp and Vegf-A, we induced over-expression of bmp2b or vegfa 121 by heat-shock treatment of Tg(hsp70l:bmp2b) or Tg(hsp70l:vegfa 121 ) transgenic lines, respectively.</s><s>As expected, bmp2b over-expression induced robust ectopic sprouts along the AV, but not from the DA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, vegfa 121 over-expression did not induce ectopic sprouts from the AV, but increased sprouting along the DA was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref>).</s><s>The distinct angiogenic responses between bmp2b over-expressing embryos and vegfa 121 over-expressing embryos demonstrate that Bmp is a distinct and potent pro-angiogenic factor.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our findings support a paradigm whereby Bmp signaling mediates venous angiogenesis, while Vegf-A signaling directs arterial angiogenesis.</s><s>In our model, this differential response to angiogenic stimuli permits neighboring venous and arterial vessels to extend distinct angiogenic sprouts and form non-overlapping vascular networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref>).</s><s>The venous sensitivity observed during Bmp-mediated angiogenesis may be provided by the notochord, which lies above the DA and expresses Bmp antagonists that inhibit blood vessel growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Collectively our results suggest a model of Bmp mediated angiogenesis in which Bmp2b binds Bmpr2a/b and Alk2/Alk3 hetero-tetrameric receptor complexes in venous endothelial cells and activates R-Smad and Erk, which elicits angiogenic responses that include sprout migration and fusion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The zebrafish embryo contains a relatively simple and streamlined vascular system, and this simplicity allows for elucidation of binary choices that likely underlie vascular development in more complex organisms.</s><s>It will be important to determine if there is a similar role for Bmp signaling during mammalian development and tumor angiogenesis.</s><s>Although published work in mammalian systems does not identify a selective requirement for Bmp signaling in venous angiogenesis, mammalian vascular systems are more complex, and the requirement for BMP signaling in early development makes specific interrogation of later requirements difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> , and anti-angiogenesis cancer drugs that singularly antagonize VEGF-A activity are only partially effective <ref type="bibr"
